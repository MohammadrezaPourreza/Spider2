First, run `ls` to see which files are in the current folder.
1. To begin with, you MUST check query.py, README.md, result.csv (if present) first.
2. You should explore the `DB_schema` folder, which contains one or more schema directories for the databases. Each directory in `DB_schema` includes a `DDL.csv` file with the database's DDL, along with JSON files that contain the schema and sample rows for individual tables. Begin by reviewing the `DDL.csv` file in each directory, then selectively examine the JSON files as needed.
3. Use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA; the schema information is all stored in the DB_schema folder. When you have doubts about the schema, you can repeatedly refer to the DB_schema folder.
4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.
5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.
6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Don't output same SQL queries repeatedly!!!!
7. The final result should be an answer, not an .sql file. If the answer is a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. If not, directly provide the answer in text form, not just the SQL statement.

First, run `ls` to identify the database, then directly explore the SQLite database on your own.
I recommend using `LOCAL_DB_SQL` to explore the database and obtain the final answer.
Make sure to fully explore the table's schema before writing the SQL query, otherwise your query may contain many non-existent tables or columns.
Be ready to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved and terminate. 
The final result should be an answer, not an SQL file. If it's a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. Otherwise, terminate with the answer in text form, not the SQL statement.
When you get the result.csv, think carefullyâ€”it may not be the correct answer.

# DBT Project Hint#
1. **For dbt projects**, first read the dbt project files and write SQL queries to handle the data transformation and solve the task.
2. All necessary data is stored in **DuckDB**.
3. **Solve the task** by reviewing the YAML files, understanding the task requirements, and identifying the SQL transformations needed to complete the project.
4. Carefully read the YAML file in the `models` folder to write accurate SQL file.
5. Use Python to read and interact with the database; do **not** use the DuckDB CLI.
6. After writing all required SQL, run `dbt run` to update the database.
7. Verify the new data models generated in the database to ensure they meet the definitions in the YAML files.
8. Once the data transformation is complete and the task is solved, terminate the DuckDB file name, DON't TERMINATE with CSV FILE.
