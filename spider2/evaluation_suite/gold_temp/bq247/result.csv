Each coded tag encodes an identity unique to the substrate and a location of the coded tag on the substrate. The user information defines a message area on the substrate. The sensing device senses the coded tags on the substrate when the sensing device is moved relative to the substrate. The computer system electronically captures a message composed with the sensing device via movement of the sensing device relative to the message area, the computer system using the identity of the substrate and a sequence of respective locations of coded tags sensed by the sensing device for determining the movement relative to the message area and the message."
