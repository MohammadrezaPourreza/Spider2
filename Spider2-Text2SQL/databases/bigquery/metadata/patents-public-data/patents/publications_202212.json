Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., Maniatis, Fritsch &amp; Sambrook, \u201cMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (1982); \u201cDNA Cloning: A Practical Approach,\u201d Volumes I and II (D. N. Glover ed. 1985); \u201cOligonucleotide Synthesis\u201d (M. J. Gait ed. 1984); \u201cNucleic Acid Hybridization\u201d (B. D. Hames &amp; S. J. Higgins eds. (1985)); \u201cTranscription and Translation\u201d (B. D. Hames &amp; S. J. Higgins eds. (1984)); \u201cAnimal Cell Culture\u201d (R. I. Freshney, ed. (1986)); \u201cImmobilized Cells and Enzymes\u201d (IRL Press, (1986)); B. Perbal, \u201cA Practical Guide To Molecular Cloning\u201d (1984).  \\n      A \u201cvector\u201d is a replicon, such as plasmid, phage or cosmid, to which another DNA segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment.  \\n      A \u201cDNA molecule\u201d refers to the polymeric form of deoxyribonucleotides (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine) in either single stranded form or a double-stranded helix. This term refers only to the primary and secondary structure of the molecule, and does not limit it to any particular tertiary forms. Thus, this term includes double-stranded DNA found, inter alia, in linear DNA molecules (e.g., restriction fragments), viruses, plasmids, and chromosomes.  \\n      A DNA \u201ccoding sequence\u201d is a DNA sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide in vivo when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The boundaries of the coding sequence are determined by a start codon at the 5\u2032 (amino) terminus and a translation stop codon at the 3\u2032 (carboxyl) terminus. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited to, prokaryotic sequences, cDNA from eukaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA sequences from eukaryotic (e.g., mammalian) DNA, and synthetic DNA sequences. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence may be located 3\u2032 to the coding sequence.  \\n      As used herein, the term \u201chybridization\u201d refers to the process of association of two nucleic acid strands to form an antiparallel duplex stabilized by means of hydrogen bonding between residues of the opposite nucleic acid strands.  \\n      The term \u201coligonucleotide\u201d refers to a short (under 100 bases in length) nucleic acid molecule.  \\n      \u201cDNA regulatory sequences\u201d, as used herein, are transcriptional and translational control sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, terminators, and the like, that provide for and/or regulate expression of a coding sequence in a host cell.  \\n      A \u201cpromoter sequence\u201d is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) coding sequence. For purposes of defining the present invention, the promoter sequence is bounded at its 3\u2032 terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5\u2032 direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence will be found a transcription initiation site, as well as protein binding domains responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. Eukaryotic promoters will often, but not always, contain \u201cTATA\u201d boxes and \u201cCAT\u201d boxes. Various promoters, including inducible promoters, may be used to drive the various vectors of the present invention.  \\n      As used herein, the terms \u201crestriction endonucleases\u201d and \u201crestriction enzymes\u201d refer to bacterial enzymes, each of which cut double-stranded DNA at or near a specific nucleotide sequence.  \\n      A cell has been \u201ctransformed\u201d or \u201ctransfected\u201d by exogenous or heterologous DNA when such DNA has been introduced inside the cell. The transforming DNA may or may not be integrated (covalently linked) into the genome of the cell. In prokaryotes, yeast, and mammalian cells for example, the transforming DNA may be maintained on an episomal element such as a plasmid. With respect to eukaryotic cells, a stably transformed cell is one in which the transforming DNA has become integrated into a chromosome so that it is inherited by daughter cells through chromosome replication. This stability is demonstrated by the ability of the eukaryotic cell to establish cell lines or clones comprised of a population of daughter cells containing the transforming DNA. A \u201cclone\u201d is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis. A \u201ccell line\u201d is a clone of a primary cell that is capable of stable growth in vitro for many generations.  \\n      A \u201cheterologous\u201d region of the DNA construct is an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus, when the heterologous region encodes a mammalian gene, the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the mammalian genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. In another example, heterologous DNA includes coding sequence in a construct where portions of genes from two different sources have been brought together so as to produce a fusion protein product. Allelic variations or naturally-occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein.  \\n      As used herein, the term \u201creporter gene\u201d refers to a coding sequence attached to heterologous promoter or enhancer elements and whose product may be assayed easily and quantifiably when the construct is introduced into tissues or cells.  \\n      The amino acids described herein are preferred to be in the \u201cL\u201d isomeric form. The amino acid sequences are given in one-letter code (A: alanine; C: cysteine; D: aspartic acid; E: glutamic acid; F: phenylalanine; G: glycine; H: histidine; I: isoleucine; K: lysine; L: leucine; M: methionine; N: asparagine; P: proline; Q: glutamine; R: arginine; S: serine; T: threonine; V: valine; W: tryptophan; Y: tyrosine; X: any residue). NH 2  refers to the free amino group present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. COOH refers to the free carboxy group present at the carboxy terminus of a polypeptide. In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature,  J. Biol. Chem.,  243 (1969), 3552-59 is used.  \\n      The term \u201cimmunologically active\u201d defines the capability of the natural, recombinant or synthetic chromo/fluorescent protein, or any oligopeptide thereof, to induce a specific immune response in appropriate animals or cells and to bind with specific antibodies. As used herein, \u201cantigenic amino acid sequence\u201d means an amino acid sequence that, either alone or in association with a carrier molecule, can elicit an antibody response in a mammal. The term \u201cspecific binding,\u201d in the context of antibody binding to an antigen, is a term well understood in the art and refers to binding of an antibody to the antigen to which the antibody was raised, but not other, unrelated antigens.  \\n      As used herein the term \u201cisolated\u201d is meant to describe a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an antibody, or a host cell that is in an environment different from that in which the polynucleotide, the polypeptide, the antibody, or the host cell naturally occurs.  \\n      Bioluminescence (BL) is defined as emission of light by living organisms that is well visible in the dark and affects visual behavior of animals (See e.g., Harvey, E. N. (1952).  Bioluminescence . New York: Academic Press; Hastings, J. W. (1995). Bioluminescence. In:  Cell Physiology  (ed. by N. Speralakis). pp. 651-681. New York: Academic Press.; Wilson, T. and Hastings, J. W. (1998). Bioluminescence.  Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol  14, 197-230.). Bioluminescence does not include so-called ultra-weak light emission, which can be detected in virtually all living structures using sensitive luminometric equipment (Murphy, M. E. and Sies, H.(1990). Visible-range low-level chemiluminescence in biological systems.  Meth. Enzymol.  186, 595-610; Radotic, K, Radenovic, C, Jeremic, M. (1998.) Spontaneous ultra-weak bioluminescence in plants: origin, mechanisms and properties.  Gen Physiol Biophys  17, 289-308), and from weak light emission which most probably does not play any ecological role, such as the glowing of bamboo growth cone (Totsune, H., Nakano, M., Inaba, H.(1993). Chemiluminescence from bamboo shoot cut.  Biochem. Biophys. Res Comm.  194, 1025-1029) or emission of light during fertilization of animal eggs (Klebanoff, S. J., Froeder, C. A., Eddy, E. M., Shapiro, B. M. (1979). Metabolic similarities between fertilization and phagocytosis. Conservation of peroxidatic mechanism.  J. Exp. Med.  149, 938-953; Schomer, B. and Epel, D. (1998). Redox changes during fertilization and maturation of marine invertebrate eggs.  Dev Biol  203, 1-11).  \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS  \\n      Nucleic acid compositions encoding novel chromo/fluoroproteins and mutants thereof, as well as the proteins encoded the same, are provided. The proteins of interest are proteins that are colored and/or fluorescent, where this feature arises from the interaction of two or more residues of the protein. The subject proteins are further characterized in that they are either obtained from non-bioluminescent Cnidarian, e.g., Anthozoan, species or are obtained from non-Pennatulacean (sea pen) Anthozoan species.

(NFP-3 &amp; NFP-4),  Discosoma striata  (NFP-5),  Discosoma  sp. \u201cred\u201d (NFP-6),  Anemonia sulcata  (NFP-7),  Discosoma  sp \u201cgreen\u201d (NFP-8), and  Discosoma  sp. \u201cmagenta\u201d (NFP-9).

It is also to be understood that the terminology employed is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments, and is not intended to be limiting. Instead, the scope of the present invention will be established by the appended claims.  \\n      In this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.  \\n      Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range, and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range, is encompassed within the invention.

Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the invention.  \\n      Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods, devices and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods, devices and materials are now described.  \\n      All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing the cell lines, vectors, methodologies and other invention components that are described in the publications which might be used in connection with the presently described invention.  \\n      In further describing the subject invention, the subject nucleic acid compositions will be described first, followed by a discussion of the subject protein compositions, antibody compositions and transgenic cells/organisms. Next a review of representative methods in which the subject proteins find use is provided.  \\n      Nucleic Acid Compositions  \\n      As summarized above, the subject invention provides nucleic acid compositions encoding chromo- and fluoroproteins and mutants thereof, as well as fragments and homologues of these proteins. By chromo and/or fluorescent protein is meant a protein that is colored, i.e., is pigmented, where the protein may or may not be fluorescent, e.g., it may exhibit low, medium or high fluorescence upon irradiation with light of an excitation wavelength. In any event, the subject proteins of interest are those in which the colored characteristic, i.e., the chromo and/or fluorescent characteristic, is one that arises from the interaction of two or more residues of the protein, and not from a single residue, more specifically a single side chain of a single residue, of the protein. As such, fluorescent proteins of the subject invention do not include proteins that exhibit fluorescence only from residues that act by themselves as intrinsic fluors, i.e., tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. As such, the fluorescent proteins of the subject invention are fluorescent proteins whose fluorescence arises from some structure in the protein that is other than the above specified single residues, e.g., it arises from an interaction of two or more residues.  \\n      By nucleic acid composition is meant a composition comprising a sequence of DNA having an open reading frame that encodes a chromo/fluoro polypeptide of the subject invention, i.e., a chromo/fluoroprotein gene, and is capable, under appropriate conditions, of being expressed as a chromo/fluoro protein according to the subject invention. Also encompassed in this term are nucleic acids that are homologous, substantially similar or identical to the nucleic acids of the present invention. Thus, the subject invention provides genes and coding sequences thereof encoding the proteins of the subject invention, as well as homologs thereof. The subject nucleic acids are present in other than their natural environment, e.g., they are isolated, present in enriched amounts, etc., from their naturally occurring environment, e.g., the organism from which they are obtained.  \\n      The nucleic acids are further characterized in that they encode proteins that are either from: (1) non-bioluminescent species, often non-bioluminescent Cnidarian species, e.g., non-bioluminescent Anthozoan species; or (2) from Anthozoan species that are not Pennatulacean species, i.e., that are not sea pens. As such, the nucleic acids may encode proteins from bioluminescent Anthozoan species, so long as these species are not Pennatulacean species, e.g., that are not Renillan or Ptilosarcan species. Specific nucleic acid compositions of interest are those that encode proteins (and mutants thereof) from the following specific Anthozoan species:  Anemonia majano, Clavularia  sp.,  Zoanthus  sp.,  Discosoma striata, Discosoma  sp. \u201cred\u201d,  Anemonia sulcata, Discosoma  sp \u201cgreen\u201d, and  Discosoma  sp. \u201cmagenta.\u201d Each of these particular types of nucleic acid compositions of interest is now discussed in greater detail individually.  \\n       Anemonia majano  (NFP-1; AmCyan; RCFP-1)  \\n      In these embodiments, the nucleic acid compositions are found in, derived from, or are mutants, homologues of, a nucleic acid found in an organism from the Anthozoan Sub-class Zoantharia, often Order Actiniaria, more often Sub-order Endomyaria, usually Family Actiniidae, and more usually Genus  Anemonia , where in many embodiments, the organism is  Anemonia majano , where the specific wild type protein of interest is amFP486 (i.e., NFP-1; RCFP-1).

In addition to nucleic acids encoding the wild type sequence and fragments thereof, also of interest are nucleic acids that encode homologues and mutants of the wild type protein.  \\n      In addition to the above described specific nucleic acid compositions, also of interest are homologues of the above sequences. With respect to homologues of the subject nucleic acids, the source of homologous genes may be any species of plant or animal or the sequence may be wholly or partially synthetic. In certain embodiments, sequence similarity between homologues is at least about 20%, sometimes at least about 25%, and may be 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or higher, including 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% or higher. Sequence similarity is calculated based on a reference sequence, which may be a subset of a larger sequence, such as a conserved motif, coding region, flanking region, etc. A reference sequence will usually be at least about 18 nt long, more usually at least about 30 nt long, and may extend to the complete sequence that is being compared. Algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art, such as BLAST, described in Altschul et al. (1990),  J. Mol. Biol.  215:403-10 (using default settings, i.e. parameters w=4 and T=17). The sequences provided herein are essential for recognizing related and homologous nucleic acids in database searches. Of particular interest in certain embodiments are nucleic acids of substantially the same length as the nucleic acid identified as SEQ ID NOS: 01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, or 17, where by substantially the same length is meant that any difference in length does not exceed about 20 number %, usually does not exceed about 10 number % and more usually does not exceed about 5 number %; and have sequence identity to any of these sequences of at least about 90%, usually at least about 95% and more usually at least about 99% over the entire length of the nucleic acid. In many embodiments, the nucleic acids have a sequence that is substantially similar (i.e. the same as) or identical to the sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, or 17. By substantially similar is meant that sequence identity will generally be at least about 60%, usually at least about 75% and often at least about 80, 85, 90, or even 95%.  \\n      Also provided are nucleic acids that encode the proteins encoded by the above described nucleic acids, but differ in sequence from the above described nucleic acids due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.  \\n      Also provided are nucleic acids that hybridize to the above described nucleic acid under stringent conditions. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization at 50\u00b0 C. or higher and 0.1\u00d7SSC (15 mM sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Another example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubation at 42\u00b0 C. in a solution: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH7.6), 5\u00d7 Denhardt&#39;s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65\u00b0 C. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as stringent as the above representative conditions, where conditions are considered to be at least as stringent if they are at least about 80% as stringent, typically at least about 90% as stringent as the above specific stringent conditions. Other stringent hybridization conditions are known in the art and may also be employed to identify nucleic acids of this particular embodiment of the invention.  \\n      Nucleic acids encoding mutants of the proteins of the invention are also provided. Mutant nucleic acids can be generated by random mutagenesis or targeted mutagenesis, using well-known techniques which are routine in the art. In some embodiments, chromo- or fluorescent proteins encoded by nucleic acids encoding homologues or mutants have the same fluorescent properties as the wild-type fluorescent protein. In other embodiments, homologue or mutant nucleic acids encode chromo- or fluorescent proteins with altered spectral properties, as described in more detail herein.  \\n      One category of mutant that is of particular interest is the non-aggregating mutant. In many embodiments, the non-aggregating mutant differs from the wild type sequence by a mutation in the N-terminus that modulates the charges appearing on side groups of the N-terminus residues, e.g., to reverse or neutralize the charge, in a manner sufficient to produce a non-aggregating mutant of the naturally occurring protein or mutant, where a particular protein is considered to be non-aggregating if it is determined be non-aggregating using the assay reported in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/270,983, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. More specifically, basic residues located near the N-termini of the proteins are substituted, e.g., Lys and Arg residues close to the N-terminus are substituted with negatively charged or neutral residues. Specific non-aggregating mutants of interest include, but are not limited to: FP1-NA; FP3-NA; FP4-NA; FP6-NA; E5-NA; 6/9Q-NA; 7A-NA; and the like, where these particular non-aggregating mutants are further described infra.  \\n      Another category of mutant of particular interest is the modulated oligomerization mutant. A mutant is considered to be a modulated oligomerization mutant if its oligomerization properties are different as compared to the wild type protein. For example, if a particular mutant oligomerizes to a greater or lesser extent than the wild type, it is considered to be an oligomerization mutant. Of particular interest are oligomerization mutants that do not oligomerize, i.e., are monomers under physiological (e.g., intracellular) conditions, or oligomerize to a lesser extent that the wild type, e.g., are dimers or trimers under intracellular conditions.  \\n      Nucleic acids of the subject invention may be cDNA or genomic DNA or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acids of the subject invention include one or more of the open reading frames encoding specific fluorescent proteins and polypeptides, and introns, as well as adjacent 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding nucleotide sequences involved in the regulation of expression, up to about 20 kb beyond the coding region, but possibly further in either direction. The subject nucleic acids may be introduced into an appropriate vector for extrachromosomal maintenance or for integration into a host genome, as described in greater detail below.  \\n      The term \u201ccDNA\u201d as used herein is intended to include all nucleic acids that share the arrangement of sequence elements found in native mature mRNA species, where sequence elements are exons and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions. Normally mRNA species have contiguous exons, with the intervening introns, when present, being removed by nuclear RNA splicing, to create a continuous open reading frame encoding the protein.  \\n      A genomic sequence of interest comprises the nucleic acid present between the initiation codon and the stop codon, as defined in the listed sequences, including all of the introns that are normally present in a native chromosome. It may further include 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 un-translated regions found in the mature mRNA. It may further include specific transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, etc., including about 1 kb, but possibly more, of flanking genomic DNA at either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the transcribed region. The genomic DNA may be isolated as a fragment of 100 kbp or smaller; and substantially free of flanking chromosomal sequence. The genomic DNA flanking the coding region, either 3\u2032 or 5\u2032, or internal regulatory sequences as sometimes found in introns, contains sequences required for proper tissue and stage specific expression.  \\n      The nucleic acid compositions of the subject invention may encode all or a part of the subject proteins. Double or single stranded fragments may be obtained from the DNA sequence by chemically synthesizing oligonucleotides in accordance with conventional methods, by restriction enzyme digestion, by PCR amplification, etc. For the most part, DNA fragments will be of at least about 15 nt, usually at least about 18 nt or about 25 nt, and may be at least about 50 nt. In some embodiments, the subject nucleic acid molecules may be about 100 nt, about 200 nt, about 300 nt, about 400 nt, about 500 nt, about 600 nt, about 700 nt, or about 720 nt in length. The subject nucleic acids may encode fragments of the subject proteins or the full-length proteins, e.g., the subject nucleic acids may encode polypeptides of about 25 aa, about 50 aa, about 75 aa, about 100 aa, about 125 aa, about 150 aa, about 200 aa, about 210 aa, about 220 aa, about 230 aa, or about 240 aa, up to the entire protein.  \\n      The subject nucleic acids are isolated and obtained in substantial purity, generally as other than an intact chromosome. Usually, the DNA will be obtained substantially free of other nucleic acid sequences that do not include a nucleic acid of the subject invention or fragment thereof, generally being at least about 50%, usually at least about 90% pure and are typically \u201crecombinant\u201d, i.e. flanked by one or more nucleotides with which it is not normally associated on a naturally occurring chromosome.  \\n      The subject polynucleotides (e.g., a polynucleotide having a sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 01 to 17 etc.), the corresponding cDNA, the full-length gene and constructs of the subject polynucleotides are provided. These molecules can be generated synthetically by a number of different protocols known to those of skill in the art. Appropriate polynucleotide constructs are purified using standard recombinant DNA techniques as described in, for example, Sambrook et al.,  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual,  2nd Ed., (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., and under current regulations described in United States Dept. of HHS, National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.  \\n      Also provided are nucleic acids that encode fusion proteins of the subject proteins, or fragments thereof, which are fused to a second protein, e.g., a degradation sequence, a signal peptide, etc. Fusion proteins may comprise a subject polypeptide, or fragment thereof, and a non-Anthozoan polypeptide (\u201cthe fusion partner\u201d) fused in-frame at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the subject polypeptide. Fusion partners include, but are not limited to, polypeptides that can bind antibody specific to the fusion partner (e.g., epitope tags); antibodies or binding fragments thereof; polypeptides that provide a catalytic function or induce a cellular response; ligands or receptors or mimetics thereof; and the like. In such fusion proteins, the fusion partner is generally not naturally associated with the subject Anthozoan portion of the fusion protein, and is typically not an Anthozoan protein or derivative/fragment thereof, i.e., it is not found in Anthozoan species.  \\n      Also provided are constructs comprising the subject nucleic acids inserted into a vector, where such constructs may be used for a number of different applications, including propagation, protein production, etc. Viral and non-viral vectors may be prepared and used, including plasmids. The choice of vector will depend on the type of cell in which propagation is desired and the purpose of propagation. Certain vectors are useful for amplifying and making large amounts of the desired DNA sequence. Other vectors are suitable for expression in cells in culture. Still other vectors are suitable for transfer and expression in cells in a whole animal or person. The choice of appropriate vector is well within the skill of the art. Many such vectors are available commercially. To prepare the constructs, the partial or full-length polynucleotide is inserted into a vector typically by means of DNA ligase attachment to a cleaved restriction enzyme site in the vector. Alternatively, the desired nucleotide sequence can be inserted by homologous recombination in vivo. Typically this is accomplished by attaching regions of homology to the vector on the flanks of the desired nucleotide sequence. Regions of homology are added by ligation of oligonucleotides, or by polymerase chain reaction using primers comprising both the region of homology and a portion of the desired nucleotide sequence, for example.  \\n      Also provided are expression cassettes or systems that find use in, among other applications, the synthesis of the subject proteins. For expression, the gene product encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention is expressed in any convenient expression system, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, insect, amphibian and mammalian systems. Suitable vectors and host cells are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,173. In the expression vector, a subject polynucleotide, e.g., as set forth in SEQ ID NOS:01; 03; 05; 07; 09; 11; 13; 15 or 17, is linked to a regulatory sequence as appropriate to obtain the desired expression properties. These regulatory sequences can include promoters (attached either at the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand or at the 3\u2032 end of the antisense strand), enhancers, terminators, operators, repressors, and inducers. The promoters can be regulated or constitutive. In some situations it may be desirable to use conditionally active promoters, such as tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific promoters. These are linked to the desired nucleotide sequence using the techniques described above for linkage to vectors. Any techniques known in the art can be used. In other words, the expression vector will provide a transcriptional and translational initiation region, which may be inducible or constitutive, where the coding region is operably linked under the transcriptional control of the transcriptional initiation region, and a transcriptional and translational termination region. These control regions may be native to the subject species from which the subject nucleic acid is obtained, or may be derived from exogenous sources.  \\n      Expression vectors generally have convenient restriction sites located near the promoter sequence to provide for the insertion of nucleic acid sequences encoding heterologous proteins. A selectable marker operative in the expression host may be present. Expression vectors may be used for, among other things, the production of fusion proteins, as described above.  \\n      Expression cassettes may be prepared comprising a transcription initiation region, the gene or fragment thereof, and a transcriptional termination region. Of particular interest is the use of sequences that allow for the expression of functional epitopes or domains, usually at least about 8 amino acids in length, more usually at least about 15 amino acids in length, to about 25 amino acids, and up to the complete open reading frame of the gene. After introduction of the DNA, the cells containing the construct may be selected by means of a selectable marker, the cells expanded and then used for expression.  \\n      The above described expression systems may be employed with prokaryotes or eukaryotes in accordance with conventional ways, depending upon the purpose for expression. For large scale production of the protein, a unicellular organism, such as  E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae , insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors, or cells of a higher organism such as vertebrates, e.g. COS 7 cells, HEK 293, CHO,  Xenopus  Oocytes, etc., may be used as the expression host cells. In some situations, it is desirable to express the gene in eukaryotic cells, where the expressed protein will benefit from native folding and post-translational modifications. Small peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory. Polypeptides that are subsets of the complete protein sequence may be used to identify and investigate parts of the protein important for function.  \\n      Specific expression systems of interest include bacterial, yeast, insect cell and mammalian cell derived expression systems. Representative systems from each of these categories is are provided below:  \\n      Bacteria.

Expression of heterologous genes in insects is accomplished as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,051; Friesen et al., \u201cThe Regulation of Baculovirus Gene Expression\u201d, in:  The Molecular Biology Of Baculoviruses  (1986) (W.

Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts are described in Luckow et al.,  Bio/Technology  (1988) 6:47-55, Miller et al.,  Generic Engineering  (1986) 8:277-279, and Maeda et al.,  Nature  (1985) 315:592-594.  \\n      Mammalian Cells. Mammalian expression is accomplished as described in Dijkema et al.,  EMBO J . (1985)4:761, Gorman et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . ( USA ) (1982) 79:6777, Boshart et al.,  Cell  (1985) 41:521 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Other features of mammalian expression are facilitated as described in Ham and Wallace,  Meth. Enz . (1979) 58:44, Barnes and Sato,  Anal. Biochem . (1980) 102:255, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,704, 4,657,866, 4,927,762, 4,560,655, WO 90/103430, WO 87/00195, and U.S. RE 30,985.  \\n      When any of the above host cells, or other appropriate host cells or organisms, are used to replicate and/or express the polynucleotides or nucleic acids of the invention, the resulting replicated nucleic acid, RNA, expressed protein or polypeptide, is within the scope of the invention as a product of the host cell or organism. The product is recovered by any appropriate means known in the art.  \\n      Once the gene corresponding to a selected polynucleotide is identified, its expression can be regulated in the cell to which the gene is native. For example, an endogenous gene of a cell can be regulated by an exogenous regulatory sequence inserted into the genome of the cell at location sufficient to at least enhance expressed of the gene in the cell. The regulatory sequence may be designed to integrate into the genome via homologous recombination, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,641,670 and 5,733,761, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference, or may be designed to integrate into the genome via non-homologous recombination, as described in WO 99/15650, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. As such, also encompassed in the subject invention is the production of the subject proteins without manipulation of the encoding nucleic acid itself, but instead through integration of a regulatory sequence into the genome of cell that already includes a gene encoding the desired protein, as described in the above incorporated patent documents.  \\n      Also provided are homologs of the subject nucleic acids. Homologs are identified by any of a number of methods. A fragment of the provided cDNA may be used as a hybridization probe against a cDNA library from the target organism of interest, where low stringency conditions are used. The probe may be a large fragment, or one or more short degenerate primers. Nucleic acids having sequence similarity are detected by hybridization under low stringency conditions, for example, at 50\u00b0 C. and 6\u00d7SSC (0.9 M sodium chloride/0.09 M sodium citrate) and remain bound when subjected to washing at 55\u00b0 C. in 1\u00d7SSC (0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate). Sequence identity may be determined by hybridization under stringent conditions, for example, at 50\u00b0 C. or higher and 0.1\u00d7SSC (15 mM-sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Nucleic acids having a region of substantial identity to the provided sequences, e.g. allelic variants, genetically altered versions of the gene, etc., bind to the provided sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. By using probes, particularly labeled probes of DNA sequences, one can isolate homologous or related genes.  \\n      Also of interest are promoter elements of the subject genomic sequences, where the sequence of the 5\u2032 flanking region may be utilized for promoter elements, including enhancer binding sites, e.g., that provide for regulation of expression in cells/tissues where the subject proteins gene are expressed.  \\n      Also provided are small DNA fragments of the subject nucleic acids, which fragments are useful as primers for PCR, hybridization screening probes, etc. Larger DNA fragments, i.e., greater than 100 nt are useful for production of the encoded polypeptide, as described in the previous section. For use in geometric amplification reactions, such as geometric PCR, a pair of primers will be used. The exact composition of the primer sequences is not critical to the invention, but for most applications the primers will hybridize to the subject sequence under stringent conditions, as known in the art. It is preferable to choose a pair of primers that will generate an amplification product of at least about 50 nt, preferably at least about 100 nt. Algorithms for the selection of primer sequences are generally known, and are available in commercial software packages. Amplification primers hybridize to complementary strands of DNA, and will prime towards each other.  \\n      The DNA may also be used to identify expression of the gene in a biological specimen. The manner in which one probes cells for the presence of particular nucleotide sequences, as genomic DNA or RNA, is well established in the literature. Briefly, DNA or mRNA is isolated from a cell sample. The mRNA may be amplified by RT-PCR, using reverse transcriptase to form a complementary DNA strand, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers specific for the subject DNA sequences. Alternatively, the mRNA sample is separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a suitable support, e.g. nitrocellulose, nylon, etc., and then probed with a fragment of the subject DNA as a probe. Other techniques, such as oligonucleotide ligation assays, in situ hybridizations, and hybridization to DNA probes arrayed on a solid chip may also find use. Detection of mRNA hybridizing to the subject sequence is indicative of Anthozoan protein gene expression in the sample.  \\n      The subject nucleic acids, including flanking promoter regions and coding regions, may be mutated in various ways known in the art to generate targeted changes in promoter strength, sequence of the encoded protein, properties of the encoded protein, including fluorescent properties of the encoded protein, etc. The DNA sequence or protein product of such a mutation will usually be substantially similar to the sequences provided herein, e.g. will differ by at least one nucleotide or amino acid, respectively, and may differ by at least two but not more than about ten nucleotides or amino acids. The sequence changes may be substitutions, insertions, deletions, or a combination thereof. Deletions may further include larger changes, such as deletions of a domain or exon, e.g. of stretches of 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150 or more aa residues. Techniques for in vitro mutagenesis of cloned genes are known. Examples of protocols for site specific mutagenesis may be found in Gustin et al. (1993),  Biotechniques  14:22; Barany (1985),  Gene  37:111-23; Colicelli et al. (1985),  Mol. Gen. Genet.  199:537-9; and Prentki et al. (1984),  Gene  29:303-13. Methods for site specific mutagenesis can be found in Sambrook et al.,  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , CSH Press 1989, pp. 15.3-15.108; Weiner et al. (1993),  Gene  126:3541; Sayers et al. (1992),  Biotechniques  13:592-6; Jones and Winistorfer (1992),  Biotechniques  12:528-30; Barton et al. (1990),  Nucleic Acids Res  18:7349-55; Marotti and Tomich (1989),  Gene Anal Tech.  6:67-70; and Zhu (1989),  Anal Biochem  177:1204. Such mutated nucleic acid derivatives may be used to study structure-function relationships of a particular chromo/fluorescent protein, or to alter properties of the protein that affect its function or regulation.  \\n      Of particular interest in many embodiments is the following specific mutation protocol, which protocol finds use in mutating chromoproteins (e.g., colored proteins that have little if any fluorescence) into fluorescent mutants. In this protocol, the sequence of the candidate protein is aligned with the amino acid sequence of  Aequorea victoria  wild type GFP, according to the protocol reported in Matz et al., \u201cFluorescent proteins from non-bioluminescent  Anthozoa  species,\u201d Nature Biotechnology (October 1999) 17: 969-973. Residue 148 of the aligned chromoprotein is identified and then changed to Ser, e.g., by site directed mutagenesis, which results in the production of a fluorescent mutant of the wild type chromoprotein. See e.g., NFP-7 described below, which wild type protein is a chromoprotein that is mutated into a fluorescent protein by substitution of Ser for the native Ala residue at position 148.  \\n      Also of interest are humanized versions of the subject nucleic acids. As used herein, the term \u201chumanized\u201d refers to changes made to the a nucleic acid sequence to optimize the codons for expression of the protein in human cells (Yang et al.,  Nucleic. Acids Research  24 (1996), 4592-4593). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,737 which describes humanization of proteins, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      Protein/Polypeptide Compositions  \\n      Also provided by the subject invention are chromo- and/or fluorescent proteins and mutants thereof, as well as polypeptide compositions related thereto. As the subject proteins are chromoproteins, they are colored proteins, which may be fluorescent, low or non-fluorescent. As used herein, the terms chromoprotein and fluorescent protein do not include luciferases, such as  Renilla  luciferase, and refer to any protein that is pigmented or colored and/or fluoresces when irradiated with light, e.g., white light or light of a specific wavelength (or narrow band of wavelengths such as an excitation wavelength). The term polypeptide composition as used herein refers to both the full-length protein, as well as portions or fragments thereof. Also included in this term are variations of the naturally occurring protein, where such variations are homologous or substantially similar to the naturally occurring protein, and mutants of the naturally occurring proteins, as described in greater detail below. The subject polypeptides are present in other than their natural environment.  \\n      In many embodiments, the subject proteins have an absorbance maximum ranging from about 300 to 700, usually from about 350 to 650 and more usually from about 400 to \u2212600 nm. Where the subject proteins are fluorescent proteins, by which is meant that they can be excited at one wavelength of light following which they will emit light at another wavelength, the excitation spectra of the subject proteins typically ranges from about 300 to 700, usually from about 350 to 650 and more usually from about 400 to 600 nm while the emission spectra of the subject proteins typically ranges from about 400 to 800, usually from about 425 to 775 and more usually from about 450 to 750 nm. The subject proteins generally have a maximum extinction coefficient that ranges from about 10,000 to 50,000 and usually from about 15,000 to 45,000. The subject proteins typically range in length from about 150 to 300 and usually from about 200 to 300 amino acid residues, and generally have a molecular weight ranging from about 15 to 35 kDa, usually from about 17.5 to 32.5 kDa.  \\n      In certain embodiments, the subject proteins are bright, where by bright is meant that the chromoproteins and their fluorescent mutants can be detected by common methods (e.g., visual screening, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorometry, fluorescent microscopy, by FACS machines, etc.) Fluorescence brightness of particular fluorescent proteins is determined by its quantum yield multiplied by maximal extinction coefficient. Brightness of a chromoproteins may be expressed by its maximal extinction coefficient.  \\n      In certain embodiments, the subject proteins fold rapidly following expression in the host cell. By rapidly folding is meant that the proteins achieve their tertiary structure that gives rise to their chromo- or fluorescent quality in a short period of time. In these embodiments, the proteins fold in a period of time that generally does not exceed about 3 days, usually does not exceed about 2 days and more usually does not exceed about 1 day.  \\n      Specific proteins of interest are chromo/fluoroproteins (and mutants thereof) from the following specific Anthozoan species:  Anemonia majano, Clavularia  sp.,  Zoanthus  sp.,  Zoanthus  sp.,  Discosoma striata, Discosoma  sp. \u201cred\u201d,  Anemonia sulcata, Discosoma  sp \u201cgreen\u201d,  Discosoma  sp. \u201cmagenta.\u201d Each of these particular types of polypeptide compositions of interest is now discussed in greater detail individually.  \\n       Anemonia majano  (NFP-1; AmCyan)  \\n      In many embodiments, the proteins have an absorbance maximum ranging from about 250 to 650, usually from about 400 to 500 and more usually from about 440 to 480 nm while the emission maximum typically ranges from about 270 to 670, usually from about 420 to 520 and more usually from about 460 to 500 nm.

Of particular interest is the dgFP512 protein (NFP-8) protein that has an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:16, as well as mutants thereof.  \\n       Discosoma  sp. \u201cmagenta\u201d (NFP-9)  \\n      In many embodiments, the proteins have an absorbance maximum that typically ranges from about 375 to 775, usually from about 525 to 625 and more usually from about 560 to 590 nm and an emission maximum that typically ranges from about 395 to 795, usually from about 545 to 645 and more usually from about 580 to 610 nm. The subject proteins typically range in length from about 200 to 250, usually from about 220 to 240 amino acid residues, and generally have a molecular weight ranging from about 20 to 30, usually from about 22.50 to 27.50 kDa. Of particular interest is the dmFP592 (NFP-9) protein that has an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO:18, as well as mutants thereof.  \\n      Homologs or proteins (or fragments thereof) that vary in sequence from the above provided specific amino acid sequences of the subject invention, i.e., SEQ ID NOS: 02; 04; 06; 08; 10; 12; 14;16 or 18, are also provided. By homolog is meant a protein having at least about 10%, usually at least about 20% and more usually at least about 30%, and in many embodiments at least about 35%, usually at least about 40% and more usually at least about 60% amino acid sequence identity to the protein of the subject invention, as determined using MegAlign, DNAstar (1998) clustal algorithm as described in D. G. Higgins and P. M. Sharp, \u201cFast and Sensitive multiple Sequence Alignments on a Microcomputer,\u201d (1989) CABIOS, 5: 151-153. (Parameters used are ktuple 1, gap, penalty 3, window, 5 and diagonals saved 5). In many embodiments, homologues of interest have much higher sequence identify, e.g., 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or higher.  \\n      Also provided are proteins that are substantially identical to the wild type protein, where by substantially identical is meant that the protein has an amino acid sequence identity to the sequence of wild type protein of at least about 60%, usually at least about 65% and more usually at least about 70%, where in some instances the identity may be much higher, e.g., 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or higher.  \\n      In many embodiments, the subject homologues have structural features found in the above provided specific sequences, where such structural features include the \u03b2-can fold.  \\n      Proteins which are mutants of the above-described naturally occurring proteins are also provided. Mutants may retain biological properties of the wild-type (e.g., naturally occurring) proteins, or may have biological properties which differ from the wild-type proteins. The term \u201cbiological property\u201d of the subject proteins includes, but is not limited to, spectral properties, such as absorbance maximum, emission maximum, maximum extinction coefficient, brightness (e.g., as compared to the wild-type protein or another reference protein such as green fluorescent protein from A. Victoria), and the like; in vivo and/or in vitro stability (e.g., half-life); etc. Mutants include single amino acid changes, deletions of one or more amino acids, N-terminal truncations, C-terminal truncations, insertions, etc.  \\n      Mutants can be generated using standard techniques of molecular biology, e.g., random mutagenesis, and targeted mutagenesis. Several mutants are described herein. Given the guidance provided in the Examples, and using standard techniques, those skilled in the art can readily generate a wide variety of additional mutants and test whether a biological property has been altered. For example, fluorescence intensity can be measured using a spectrophotometer at various excitation wavelengths.  \\n      Those proteins of the subject invention that are naturally occurring proteins are present in a non-naturally occurring environment, e.g., are separated from their naturally occurring environment. In certain embodiments, the subject proteins are present in a composition that is enriched for the subject protein as compared to its naturally occurring environment. For example, purified protein is provided, where by purified is meant that the protein is present in a composition that is substantially free of non-chromo/fluoroprotein proteins of interest, where by substantially free is meant that less than 90%, usually less than 60% and more usually less than 50% of the composition is made up of non-chromoproteins or mutants thereof of interest. The proteins of the subject invention may also be present as an isolate, by which is meant that the protein is substantially free of other proteins and other naturally occurring biologic molecules, such as oligosaccharides, polynucleotides and fragments thereof, and the like, where the term \u201csubstantially free\u201d in this instance means that less than 70%, usually less than 60% and more usually less than 50% of the composition containing the isolated protein is some other naturally occurring biological molecule. In certain embodiments, the proteins are present in substantially pure form, where by \u201csubstantially pure form\u201d is meant at least 95%, usually at least 97% and more usually at least 99% pure.  \\n      In addition to the naturally occurring proteins, polypeptides that vary from the naturally occurring proteins, e.g., the mutant proteins described above, are also provided. Generally such polypeptides include an amino acid sequence encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) of the gene encoding the subject wild type protein, including the full length protein and fragments thereof, particularly biologically active fragments and/or fragments corresponding to functional domains, and the like; and including fusions of the subject polypeptides to other proteins or parts thereof. Fragments of interest will typically be at least about 10 aa in length, usually at least about 50 aa in length, and may be as long as 300 aa in length or longer, but will usually not exceed about 1000 aa in length, where the fragment will have a stretch of amino acids that is identical to the subject protein of at least about 10 aa, and usually at least about 15 aa, and in many embodiments at least about 50 aa in length. In some embodiments, the subject polypeptides are about 25 aa, about 50 aa, about 75 aa, about 100 aa, about 125 aa, about 150 aa, about 200 aa, about 210 aa, about 220 aa, about 230 aa, or about 240 aa in length, up to the entire protein. In some embodiments, a protein fragment retains all or substantially all of a biological property of the wild-type protein.  \\n      The subject proteins and polypeptides may be obtained from naturally occurring sources or synthetically produced. For example, wild type proteins may be derived from biological sources which express the proteins, e.g., non-bioluminescent  Cnidarian , e.g., Anthozoan, species, such as the specific ones listed above. The subject proteins may also be derived from synthetic means, e.g., by expressing a recombinant gene or nucleic acid coding sequence encoding the protein of interest in a suitable host, as described above. Any convenient protein purification procedures may be employed, where suitable protein purification methodologies are described in Guide to Protein Purification, (Deuthser ed.) (Academic Press, 1990). For example, a lysate may prepared from the original source and purified using HPLC, exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and the like.  \\n      Antibody Compositions  \\n      Also provided are antibodies that specifically bind to the subject fluorescent proteins. Suitable antibodies are obtained by immunizing a host animal with peptides comprising all or a portion of the subject protein. Suitable host animals include mouse, rat sheep, goat, hamster, rabbit, etc. The origin of the protein immunogen will generally be a Cnidarian species, specifcally a non-bioluminescent Cnidarian species, such as an Anthozoan species or a non-Petalucean Anthozoan species. The host animal will generally be a different species than the immunogen, e.g., mice, etc.  \\n      The immunogen may comprise the complete protein, or fragments and derivatives thereof. Preferred immunogens comprise all or a part of the protein, where these residues contain the post-translation modifications found on the native target protein. Immunogens are produced in a variety of ways known in the art, e.g., expression of cloned genes using conventional recombinant methods, isolation from Anthozoan species of origin, etc.  \\n      For preparation of polyclonal antibodies, the first step is immunization of the host animal with the target protein, where the target protein will preferably be in substantially pure form, comprising less than about 1% contaminant. The immunogen may comprise the complete target protein, fragments or derivatives thereof. To increase the immune response of the host animal, the target protein may be combined with an adjuvant, where suitable adjuvants include alum, dextran, sulfate, large polymeric anions, oil &amp; water emulsions, e.g. Freund&#39;s adjuvant, Freund&#39;s complete adjuvant, and the like. The target protein may also be conjugated to synthetic carrier proteins or synthetic antigens. A variety of hosts may be immunized to produce the polyclonal antibodies. Such hosts include rabbits, guinea pigs, rodents, e.g. mice, rats, sheep, goats, and the like. The target protein is administered to the host, usually intradermally, with an initial dosage followed by one or more, usually at least two, additional booster dosages. Following immunization, the blood from the host will be collected, followed by separation of the serum from the blood cells. The Ig present in the resultant antiserum may be further fractionated using known methods, such as ammonium salt fractionation, DEAE chromatography, and the like.  \\n      Monoclonal antibodies are produced by conventional techniques. Generally, the spleen and/or lymph nodes of an immunized host animal provide a source of plasma cells.  \\n      The plasma cells are immortalized by fusion with myeloma cells to produce hybridoma cells. Culture supernatant from individual hybridomas is screened using standard techniques to identify those producing antibodies with the desired specificity. Suitable animals for production of monoclonal antibodies to the human protein include mouse, rat, hamster, etc. To raise antibodies against the mouse protein, the animal will generally be a hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, etc. The antibody may be purified from the hybridoma cell supernatants or ascites fluid by conventional techniques, e.g. affinity chromatography using protein bound to an insoluble support, protein A sepharose, etc.  \\n      The antibody may be produced as a single chain, instead of the normal multimeric structure. Single chain antibodies are described in Jost et al. (1994)  J.B.C.  269:26267-73, and others. DNA sequences encoding the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain are ligated to a spacer encoding at least about 4 amino acids of small neutral amino acids, including glycine and/or serine. The protein encoded by this fusion allows assembly of a functional variable region that retains the specificity and affinity of the original antibody.  \\n      Also of interest in certain embodiments are humanized antibodies. Methods of humanizing antibodies are known in the art. The humanized antibody may be the product of an animal having transgenic human immunoglobulin constant region genes (see for example International Patent Applications WO 90/10077 and WO 90/04036). Alternatively, the antibody of interest may be engineered by recombinant DNA techniques to substitute the CH1, CH2, CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework domain with the corresponding human sequence (see WO 92/02190).  \\n      The use of Ig cDNA for construction of chimeric immunoglobulin genes is known in the art (Liu et al. (1987)  P.N.A.S.  84:3439 and (1987)  J. Immunol.  139:3521). mRNA is isolated from a hybridoma or other cell producing the antibody and used to produce cDNA. The cDNA of interest may be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using specific primers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202). Alternatively, a library is made and screened to isolate the sequence of interest. The DNA sequence encoding the variable region of the antibody is then fused to human constant region sequences. The sequences of human constant regions genes may be found in Kabat et al. (1991)  Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest , N.I.H. publication no. 91-3242. Human C region genes are readily available from known clones. The choice of isotype will be guided by the desired effector functions, such as complement fixation, or activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Preferred isotypes are IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4. Either of the human light chain constant regions, kappa or lambda, may be used. The chimeric, humanized antibody is then expressed by conventional methods.  \\n      Antibody fragments, such as Fv, F(ab\u2032) 2  and Fab may be prepared by cleavage of the intact protein, e.g. by protease or chemical cleavage. Alternatively, a truncated gene is designed. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a portion of the F(ab\u2032) 2  fragment would include DNA sequences encoding the CH1 domain and hinge region of the H chain, followed by a translational stop codon to yield the truncated molecule.  \\n      Consensus sequences of H and L J regions may be used to design oligonucleotides for use as primers to introduce useful restriction sites into the J region for subsequent linkage of V region segments to human C region segments. C region cDNA can be modified by site directed mutagenesis to place a restriction site at the analogous position in the human sequence.  \\n      Expression vectors include plasmids, retroviruses, YACs, EBV derived episomes, and the like. A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human CH or CL immunoglobulin sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any VH or VL sequence can be easily inserted and expressed. In such vectors, splicing usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C region, and also at the splice regions that occur within the human CH exons. Polyadenylation and transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding regions. The resulting chimeric antibody may be joined to any strong promoter, including retroviral LTRs, e.g. SV40 early promoter, (Okayama et al. (1983)  Mol. Cell. Bio.  3:280), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (Gorman et al. (1982)  P.N.A.S.  79:6777), and moloney murine leukemia virus LTR (Grosschedl et al. (1985)  Cell  41:885); native Ig promoters, etc.  \\n      Transgenics  \\n      The subject nucleic acids can be used to generate transgenic, non-human plants or animals or site specific gene modifications in cell lines. Transgenic cells of the subject invention include on or more nucleic acids according to the subject invention present as a transgene, where included within this definition are the parent cells transformed to include the transgene and the progeny thereof. In many embodiments, the transgenic cells are cells that do not normally harbor or contain a nucleic acid according to the subject invention. In those embodiments where the transgenic cells do naturally contain the subject nucleic acids, the nucleic acid will be present in the cell in a position other than its natural location, i.e. integrated into the genomic material of the cell at a non-natural location. Transgenic animals may be made through homologous recombination, where the endogenous locus is altered. Alternatively, a nucleic acid construct is randomly integrated into the genome. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like.  \\n      Transgenic organisms of the subject invention include cells and multicellular organisms, e.g., plants and animals, that are endogenous knockouts in which expression of the endogenous gene is at least reduced if not eliminated. Transgenic organisms of interest also include cells and multicellular organisms, e.g., plants and animals, in which the protein or variants thereof is expressed in cells or tissues where it is not normally expressed and/or at levels not normally present in such cells or tissues.  \\n      DNA constructs for homologous recombination will comprise at least a portion of the gene of the subject invention, wherein the gene has the desired genetic modification(s), and includes regions of homology to the target locus. DNA constructs for random integration need not include regions of homology to mediate recombination. Conveniently, markers for positive and negative selection are included. Methods for generating cells having targeted gene modifications through homologous recombination are known in the art. For various techniques for transfecting mammalian cells, see Keown et al. (1990),  Meth. Enzymol.  185:527-537.  \\n      For embryonic stem (ES) cells, an ES cell line may be employed, or embryonic cells may be obtained freshly from a host, e.g. mouse, rat, guinea pig, etc. Such cells are grown on an appropriate fibroblast-feeder layer or grown in the presence of leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF). When ES or embryonic cells have been transformed, they may be used to produce transgenic animals. After transformation, the cells are plated onto a feeder layer in an appropriate medium. Cells containing the construct may be detected by employing a selective medium. After sufficient time for colonies to grow, they are picked and analyzed for the occurrence of homologous recombination or integration of the construct. Those colonies that are positive may then be used for embryo manipulation and blastocyst injection. Blastocysts are obtained from 4 to 6 week old superovulated females. The ES cells are trypsinized, and the modified cells are injected into the blastocoel of the blastocyst. After injection, the blastocysts are returned to each uterine horn of pseudopregnant females. Females are then allowed to go to term and the resulting offspring screened for the construct. By providing for a different phenotype of the blastocyst and the genetically modified cells, chimeric progeny can be readily detected.  \\n      The chimeric animals are screened for the presence of the modified gene and males and females having the modification are mated to produce homozygous progeny. If the gene alterations cause lethality at some point in development, tissues or organs can be maintained as allogeneic or congenic grafts or transplants, or in in vitro culture. The transgenic animals may be any non-human mammal, such as laboratory animals, domestic animals, etc. The transgenic animals may be used in functional studies, drug screening, etc. Representative examples of the use of transgenic animals include those described infra.  \\n      Transgenic plants may be produced in a similar manner. Methods of preparing transgenic plant cells and plants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,767,367; 5,750,870; 5,739,409; 5,689,049; 5,689,045; 5,674,731; 5,656,466; 5,633,155; 5,629,470; 5,595,896; 5,576,198; 5,538,879; 5,484,956; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Methods of producing transgenic plants are also reviewed in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (eds Lea &amp; Leegood, John Wiley &amp; Sons)(1993) pp 275-295. In brief, a suitable plant cell or tissue is harvested, depending on the nature of the plant species. As such, in certain instances, protoplasts will be isolated, where such protoplasts may be isolated from a variety of different plant tissues, e.g. leaf, hypoctyl, root, etc. For protoplast isolation, the harvested cells are incubated in the presence of cellulases in order to remove the cell wall, where the exact incubation conditions vary depending on the type of plant and/or tissue from which the cell is derived. The resultant protoplasts are then separated from the resultant cellular debris by sieving and centrifugation. Instead of using protoplasts, embryogenic explants comprising somatic cells may be used for preparation of the transgenic host. Following cell or tissue harvesting, exogenous DNA of interest is introduced into the plant cells, where a variety of different techniques are available for such introduction. With isolated protoplasts, the opportunity arise for introduction via DNA-mediated gene transfer protocols, including: incubation of the protoplasts with naked DNA, e.g. plasmids, comprising the exogenous coding sequence of interest in the presence of polyvalent cations, e.g. PEG or PLO; and electroporation of the protoplasts in the presence of naked DNA comprising the exogenous sequence of interest. Protoplasts that have successfully taken up the exogenous DNA are then selected, grown into a callus, and ultimately into a transgenic plant through contact with the appropriate amounts and ratios of stimulatory factors, e.g. auxins and cytokinins. With embryogenic explants, a convenient method of introducing the exogenous DNA in the target somatic cells is through the use of particle acceleration or \u201cgene-gun\u201d protocols. The resultant explants are then allowed to grow into chimera plants, cross-bred and transgenic progeny are obtained. Instead of the naked DNA approaches described above, another convenient method of producing transgenic plants is  Agrobacterium  mediated transformation. With  Agrobacterium  mediated transformation, co-integrative or binary vectors comprising the exogenous DNA are prepared and then introduced into an appropriate  Agrobacterium  strain, e.g.  A. tumefaciens . The resultant bacteria are then incubated with prepared protoplasts or tissue explants, e.g. leaf disks, and a callus is produced. The callus is then grown under selective conditions, selected and subjected to growth media to induce root and shoot growth to ultimately produce a transgenic plant.  \\n      Utility  \\n      The subject chromoproteins and fluorescent mutants thereof find use in a variety of different applications, where the applications necessarily differ depending on whether the protein is a chromoprotein or a fluorescent protein. Representative uses for each of these types of proteins will be described below, where the follow described uses are merely representative and are in no way meant to limit the use of the subject proteins to those described below.  \\n      Chromoproteins  \\n      The subject chromoproteins of the present invention find use in a variety of different applications. One application of interest is the use of the subject proteins as coloring agents which are capable of imparting color or pigment to a particular composition of matter. Of particular interest in certain embodiments are non-toxic chromoproteins. The subject chromoproteins may be incorporated into a variety of different compositions of matter, where representative compositions of matter include: food compositions, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, living organisms, e.g., animals and plants, and the like. Where used as a coloring agent or pigment, a sufficient amount of the chromoprotein is incorporated into the composition of matter to impart the desired color or pigment thereto. The chromoprotein may be incorporated into the composition of matter using any convenient protocol, where the particular protocol employed will necessarily depend, at least in part, on the nature of the composition of matter to be colored. Protocols that may be employed include, but are not limited to: blending, diffusion, friction, spraying, injection, tattooing, and the like.  \\n      The chromoproteins may also find use as labels in analyte detection assays, e.g., assays for biological analytes of interest. For example, the chromoproteins may be incorporated into adducts with analyte specific antibodies or binding fragments thereof and subsequently employed in immunoassays for analytes of interest in a complex sample, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,536; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Instead of antibodies or binding fragments thereof, the subject chromoproteins or chromogenic fragments thereof may be conjugated to ligands that specifically bind to an analyte of interest, or other moieties, growth factors, hormones, and the like; as is readily apparent to those of skill in the art.  \\n      In yet other embodiments, the subject chromoproteins may be used as selectable markers in recombinant DNA applications, e.g., the production of transgenic cells and organisms, as described above. As such, one can engineer a particular transgenic production protocol to employ expression of the subject chromoproteins as a selectable marker, either for a successful or unsuccessful protocol. Thus, appearance of the color of the subject chromoprotein in the phenotype of the transgenic organism produced by a particular process can be used to indicate that the particular organism successfully harbors the transgene of interest, often integrated in a manner that provides for expression of the transgene in the organism. When used a selectable marker, a nucleic acid encoding for the subject chromoprotein can be employed in the transgenic generation process, where this process is described in greater detail supra. Particular transgenic organisms of interest where the subject proteins may be employed as selectable markers include transgenic plants, animals, bacteria, fungi, and the like.  \\n      In yet other embodiments, the chromoproteins (and fluorescent proteins) of the subject invention find use in sunscreens, as selective filters, etc., in a manner similar to the uses of the proteins described in WO 00/46233.  \\n      Fluorescent Proteins  \\n      The subject fluorescent proteins of the present invention (as well as other components of the subject invention described above) find use in a variety of different applications, where such applications include, but are not limited to, the following. The first application of interest is the use of the subject proteins in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications. In these applications, the subject proteins serve as donor and/or acceptors in combination with a second fluorescent protein or dye, e.g., a fluorescent protein as described in Matz et al., Nature Biotechnology (October 1999) 17:969-973, a green fluorescent protein from  Aequora victoria  or fluorescent mutant thereof, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,066,476; 6,020,192; 5,985,577; 5,976,796; 5,968,750; 5,968,738; 5,958,713; 5,919,445; 5,874,304, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference, other fluorescent dyes, e.g., coumarin and its derivatives, e.g. 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, aminocoumarin, bodipy dyes, such as Bodipy FL, cascade blue, fluorescein and its derivatives, e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate, Oregon green, rhodamine dyes, e.g. texas red, tetramethylrhodamine, eosins and erythrosins, cyanine dyes, e.g. Cy3 and Cy5, macrocyclic chelates of lanthanide ions, e.g. quantum dye, etc., chemilumescent dyes, e.g., luciferases, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,746; 5,700,673; 5,674,713; 5,618,722; 5,418,155; 5,330,906; 5,229,285; 5,221,623; 5,182,202; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Specific examples of where FRET assays employing the subject fluorescent proteins may be used include, but are not limited to: the detection of protein-protein interactions, e.g., mammalian two-hybrid system, transcription factor dimerization, membrane protein multimerization, multiprotein complex formation, etc., as a biosensor for a number of different events, where a peptide or protein covalently links a FRET fluorescent combination including the subject fluorescent proteins and the linking peptide or protein is, e.g., a protease specific substrate, e.g., for caspase mediated cleavage, a linker that undergoes conformational change upon receiving a signal which increases or decreases FRET, e.g., PKA regulatory domain (cAMP-sensor), phosphorylation, e.g., where there is a phosphorylation site in the linker or the linker has binding specificity to phosphorylated/dephosphorylated domain of another protein, or the linker has Ca 2+  binding domain. Representative fluorescence resonance energy transfer or FRET applications in which the subject proteins find use include, but are not limited to, those described in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,008,373; 5,998,146; 5,981,200; 5,945,526; 5,945,283; 5,911,952; 5,869,255; 5,866,336; 5,863,727; 5,728,528; 5,707,804; 5,688,648; 5,439,797; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      The subject fluorescent proteins also find use as biosensors in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, e.g. as Ca 2+  ion indicator; as pH indicator, as phorphorylation indicator, as an indicator of other ions, e.g., magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride and halides. For example, for detection of Ca ion, proteins containing an EF-hand motif are known to translocate from the cytosol to membranes upon Ca 2+  binding. These proteins contain a myristoyl group that is buried within the molecule by hydrophobic interactions with other regions of the protein. Binding of Ca 2+  induces a conformational change exposing the myristoyl group which then is available for the insertion into the lipid bilayer (called a \u201cCa 2+ -myristoyl switch\u201d). Fusion of such a EF-hand containing protein to Fluorescent Proteins (FP) could make it an indicator of intracellular Ca 2+  by monitoring the translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy. EF-hand proteins suitable for use in this system include, but are not limited to: recoverin (1-3), calcineurin B, troponin C, visinin, neurocalcin, calmodulin, parvalbumin, and the like. For pH, a system based on hisactophilins may be employed. Hisactophilins are myristoylated histidine-rich proteins known to exist in Dictyostelium. Their binding to actin and acidic lipids is sharply pH-dependent within the range of cytoplasmic pH variations. In living cells membrane binding seems to override the interaction of hisactophilins with actin filaments. At pH 6.5 they locate to the plasma membrane and nucleus. In contrast, at pH 7.5 they evenly distribute throughout the cytoplasmic space. This change of distribution is reversible and is attributed to histidine clusters exposed in loops on the surface of the molecule. The reversion of intracellular distribution in the range of cytoplasmic pH variations is in accord with a pK of 6.5 of histidine residues. The cellular distribution is independent of myristoylation of the protein. By fusing FPs (Fluoresent Proteins) to hisactophilin the intracellular distribution of the fusion protein can be followed by laser scanning, confocal microscopy or standard fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative fluorescence analysis can be done by performing line scans through cells (laser scanning confocal microscopy) or other electronic data analysis (e.g., using metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp) and averaging of data collected in a population of cells. Substantial pH-dependent redistribution of hisactophilin-FP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane occurs within 1-2 min and reaches a steady state level after 5-10 min. The reverse reaction takes place on a similar time scale. As such, hisactophilin-fluorescent protein fusion protein that acts in an analogous fashion can be used to monitor cytosolic pH changes in real time in live mammalian cells. Such methods have use in high throughput applications, e.g., in the measurement of pH changes as consequence of growth factor receptor activation (e.g. epithelial or platelet-derived growth factor) chemotactic stimulation/cell locomotion, in the detection of intracellular pH changes as second messenger, in the monitoring of intracellular pH in pH manipulating experiments, and the like. For detection of PKC activity, the reporter system exploits the fact that a molecule called MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) is a PKC substrate. It is anchored to the plasma membrane via myristoylation and a stretch of positively charged amino acids (ED-domain) that bind to the negatively charged plasma membrane via electrostatic interactions. Upon PKC activation the ED-domain becomes phosphorylated by PKC, thereby becoming negatively charged, and as a consequence of electrostatic repulsion MARCKS translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (called the \u201cmyristoyl-electrostatic switch\u201d). Fusion of the N-terminus of MARCKS ranging from the myristoylation motif to the ED-domain of MARCKS to fluorescent proteins of the present invention makes the above a detector system for PKC activity. When phosphorylated by PKC, the fusion protein translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This translocation is followed by standard fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy e.g. using the Cellomics technology or other High Content Screening systems (e.g. Universal Imaging Corp./Becton Dickinson). The above reporter system has application in High Content Screening, e.g., screening for PKC inhibitors, and as an indicator for PKC activity in many screening scenarios for potential reagents interfering with this signal transduction pathway. Methods of using fluorescent proteins as biosensors also include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 972,638; 5,824,485 and 5,650,135 (as well as the references cited therein) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in applications involving the automated screening of arrays of cells expressing fluorescent reporting groups by using microscopic imaging and electronic analysis. Screening can be used for drug discovery and in the field of functional genomics: e.g., where the subject proteins are used as markers of whole cells to detect changes in multicellular reorganization and migration, e.g., formation of multicellular tubules (blood vessel formation) by endothelial cells, migration of cells through Fluoroblok Insert System (Becton Dickinson Co.), wound healing, neurite outgrowth, etc.; where the proteins are used as markers fused to peptides (e.g., targeting sequences) and proteins that allow the detection of change of intracellular location as indicator for cellular activity, for example: signal transduction, such as kinase and transcription factor translocation upon stimuli, such as protein kinase C, protein kinase A, transcription factor NFkB, and NFAT; cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cyclinE; protease cleavage with subsequent movement of cleaved substrate, phospholipids, with markers for intracellular structures such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, nucleus, nucleoli, plasma membrane, histones, endosomes, lysosomes, microtubules, actin) as tools for High Content Screening: co-localization of other fluorescent fusion proteins with these localization markers as indicators of movements of intracellular fluorescent fusion proteins/peptides or as marker alone; and the like. Examples of applications involving the automated screening of arrays of cells in which the subject fluorescent proteins find use include: U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,835; as well as WO/0017624; WO 00/26408; WO 00/17643; and WO 00/03246; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in high through-put screening assays. The subject fluorescent proteins are stable proteins with half-lives of more than 24 h. Also provided are destabilized versions of the subject fluorescent proteins with shorter half-lives that can be used as transcription reporters for drug discovery. For example, a protein according to the subject invention can be fused with a putative proteolytic signal sequence derived from a protein with shorter half-life, e.g., PEST sequence from the mouse ornithine decarboxylase gene, mouse cyclin B1 destruction box and ubiquitin, etc. For a description of destabilized proteins and vectors that can be employed to produce the same, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,313; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Promoters in signal transduction pathways can be detected using destabilized versions of the subject fluorescent proteins for drug screening, e.g., AP1, NFAT, NFkB, Smad, STAT, p53, E2F, Rb, myc, CRE, ER, GR and TRE, and the like.  \\n      The subject proteins can be used as second messenger detectors, e.g., by fusing the subject proteins to specific domains: e.g., PKCgamma Ca binding domain, PKCgamma DAG binding domain, SH2 domain and SH3 domain, etc.  \\n      Secreted forms of the subject proteins can be prepared, e.g. by fusing secreted leading sequences to the subject proteins to construct secreted forms of the subject proteins, which in turn can be used in a variety of different applications.  \\n      The subject proteins also find use in fluorescence activated cell sorting applications. In such applications, the subject fluorescent protein is used as a label to mark a population of cells and the resulting labeled population of cells is then sorted with a fluorescent activated cell sorting device, as is known in the art. FACS methods are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,968,738 and 5,804,387; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      The subject proteins also find use as in vivo marker in animals (e.g., transgenic animals). For example, expression of the subject protein can be driven by tissue specific promoters, where such methods find use in research for gene therapy, e.g., testing efficiency of transgenic expression, among other applications. A representative application of fluorescent proteins in transgenic animals that illustrates this class of applications of the subject proteins is found in WO 00/02997, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.  \\n      Additional applications of the subject proteins include: as markers following injection into cells or animals and in calibration for quantitative measurements (fluorescence and protein); as markers or reporters in oxygen biosensor devices for monitoring cell viability; as markers or labels for animals, pets, toys, food, etc.; and the like.  \\n      The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in protease cleavage assays. For example, cleavage inactivated fluorescence assays can be developed using the subject proteins, where the subject proteins are engineered to include a protease specific cleavage sequence without destroying the fluorescent character of the protein. Upon cleavage of the fluorescent protein by an activated protease fluorescence would sharply decrease due to the destruction of a functional chromophor. Alternatively, cleavage activated fluorescence can be developed using the subject proteins, where the subject proteins are engineered to contain an additional spacer sequence in close proximity/or inside the chromophor. This variant would be significantly decreased in its fluorescent activity, because parts of the functional chromophor would be divided by the spacer. The spacer would be framed by two identical protease specific cleavage sites. Upon cleavage via the activated protease the spacer would be cut out and the two residual \u201csubunits\u201d of the fluorescent protein would be able to reassemble to generate a functional fluorescent protein. Both of the above types of application could be developed in assays for a variety of different types of proteases, e.g., caspases, etc.  \\n      The subject proteins can also be used is assays to determine the phospholipid composition in biological membranes. For example, fusion proteins of the subject proteins (or any other kind of covalent or non-covalent modification of the subject proteins) that allows binding to specific phospholipids to localize/visualize patterns of phospholipid distribution in biological membranes also allowing colocalization of membrane proteins in specific phospholipid rafts can be accomplished with the subject proteins. For example, the PH domain of GRP1 has a high affinity to phosphatidyl-inositol tri-phosphate (PIP3) but not to PIP2. As such, a fusion protein between the PH domain of GRP1 and the subject proteins can be constructed to specifically label PIP3 rich areas in biological membranes.  \\n      Yet another application of the subject proteins is as a fluorescent timer, in which the switch of one fluorescent color to another (e.g. green to red) concomitant with the ageing of the fluorescent protein is used to determine the activation/deactivation of gene expression, e.g., developmental gene expression, cell cycle dependent gene expression, circadian rhythm specific gene expression, and the like  \\n      The antibodies of the subject invention, described above, also find use in a number of applications, including the differentiation of the subject proteins from other fluorescent proteins.  \\n      Kits  \\n      Also provided by the subject invention are kits for use in practicing one or more of the above described applications, where the subject kits typically include elements for making the subject proteins, e.g., a construct comprising a vector that includes a coding region for the subject protein. The subject kit components are typically present in a suitable storage medium, e.g., buffered solution, typically in a suitable container. Also present in the subject kits may be antibodies to the provided protein. In certain embodiments, the kit comprises a plurality of different vectors each encoding the subject protein, where the vectors are designed for expression in different environments and/or under different conditions, e.g., constitutive expression where the vector includes a strong promoter for expression in mammalian cells, a promoterless vector with a multiple cloning site for custom insertion of a promoter and tailored expression, etc.  \\n      In addition to the above components, the subject kits will further include instructions for practicing the subject methods. These instructions may be present in the subject kits in a variety of forms, one or more of which may be present in the kit. One form in which these instructions may be present is as printed information on a suitable medium or substrate, e.g., a piece or pieces of paper on which the information is printed, in the packaging of the kit, in a package insert, etc. Yet another means would be a computer readable medium, e.g., diskette, CD, etc., on which the information has been recorded. Yet another means that may be present is a website address which may be used via the internet to access the information at a removed site. Any convenient means may be present in the kits.  \\n      The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.  \\n     Experimental  \\n      I.

Construction of amFP486 Mutants \\n \\n      Two mutants of amFP486 were-generated, Mut15 and Mut32. Mut32 has the following amino acid substitutions relative to the wildtype: K65M according to GFP alignment numbering as described in Matz et al., supra, or K68M according to self numbering. Mut15 has the following amino acid substitutions relative to the wildtype: K65L according to GFP alignment numbering as described in Matz et al., supra, or K68L according to self numbering. Compared with wildtype amFP486 nucleic acid sequence, Mut15 has the following point mutations: A101G, T129C, AAA 202-204TTG, and C240T. (i.e., A to G at position 101 (numbered from beginning of ATG), T to C at position 129; AAA to TTG at positions 202-204; C to T at position 240).  \\n      Table 2 lists the spectral properties of Mut15 and Mut32.  \\n               TABLE 2                          Spectral Properties of the Isolated Mut15 and Mut32                                                 Absorbance   Emission   Maximum                   NFP   Maximum   Maximum   Extinction   Quantum   Relative       Species   Name   nm   nm   Coeff.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n \\n      Mut32 DNA was amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone with BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, Calif.).  \\n      Functional tests of the generated vectors were performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, brighter fluorescent intensity and less photobleaching of pCNFPMut32-N1 were observed by microscopy when compared with pECFP-N1 side by side.  \\n      Mut32 has fast folding and bright fluorescent intensity, which makes it useful for number of applications. Some fusion proteins were tested, such as PKC-gamma-CNFP. PKC was observed to translocate from cytosol to the plasma membrane when cells were treated with PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate).  \\n      C. Generation of Destabilized amFP486 Vectors as Transcription Reporters  \\n      Three destabilized amFP486 vectors were constructed by fusing different mouse ODC degradation domains such as d1, d2 and d376 to the C-terminal of wild type amFP486 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,600; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. The vectors were constructed in the EGFP-N1 backbone.  \\n      Vectors of pCRE-d1CNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1CNFP were constructed by placing d1CNFP downstream of cAMP response element (CRE) or NF-\u03baB response element, respectively. Expression of d1CNFP is up-regulated upon activation of these response elements.  \\n      D. Functional Analysis of Destabilized amFP486  \\n      Functional tests of the destabilized amFP486 were performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, the fluorescent intensity was decreased gradually from d2, d1 and d376 because of the fusion with different mouse ODC degradation domains. After 4-hour treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, d2 fluorescent intensity did not change very much; however, d1 fluorescent intensity decreased further 50% of its original intensity. The half-life of d1 is around 4 hours.  \\n      MODCd1 is a valuable tool for application as a transcription reporter. However, compared with EGFP-d1 (1-hour half-life), pCNFP-MODCd1 half-life (4 hours) is still long, so further mutagenesis for MODC degradation domain is still needed for shorter half-life version.  \\n      Functional tests of vectors pCRE-d1CNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1CNFP were performed by transient transfection in HEK 293 cells. 16 hours post transfection, 10 \u03bcm forskolin was added to induce CRE and 100 ng/ml TNF-alpha was added to induce NF-\u03baB for 6 hours. Expression of d1CNFP was analyzed using FACS Calibur. Up to 7 fold increase of fluorescence in forskolin induced CRE activation and 4 fold increase of fluorescence in TNF-\u03b1 induced NF-KB activation was observed.  \\n      E. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized Mut32 (phCNFP-N1)  \\n      Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, a human favored codon version of this mutant is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. To generate humanized Mut32, the Mut 32 sequence was first changed to human favored codon and 23 oligos (12F and 11R) were designed. Next, four rounds of PCR amplification were performed, each round for 20 cycles. PCR cycle was designed as follows: 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min; 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min; 40\u00b0 C. for 1 min; and 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min. The four rounds were: for 1 st  round, mixing 2 \u03bcl each of every 4 oligos (60 bp), 5 \u03bcl buffer, 1 \u03bcl pfu, 1 \u03bcl dNTP to make total volume of 50 \u03bcl. After 20 cycles of PCR, 5 sets of 150 bp and 1 set of 4 last oligos of 90 bp products were obtained. For 2 nd  round, mixing new crude PCR products 10 \u03bcl each, 5 \u03bcl buffer, 1 \u03bcl pfu, 1 \u03bcl dNTP to make total volume of 50 \u03bcl. After 20 cycles of PCR, 2 sets of 270 bp and 1set of 210 bp PCR products were obtained. For 3 rd  round, mixing new crude PCR products. After 20 cycles of PCR, 1 set of 510 bp and 1 set of 450 bp products were obtained. For 4 th  round, mixing new crude products. After 20 cycles of PCR, final PCR product (690 bp) was obtained. Further PCR amplification was performed using 1F and 11R primers. As a result, humanized Mut32 was generated. This humanized Mut32 was constituted into EGFP-N1 backbone.  \\n      F. Expression of Wildtype and Mutant amFP486 in Mammalian Cells  \\n      The original plasmid amFP486 DNAs (wildtype, Mut15 and Mut32 in pQE30) were used to construct N1 version of amFP486 wildtype, Mut-15 and Mut32 as described above. The DNAs were inserted into  E. coli  DH5a. HEK 293 cells were transferred with each of the three N1 constructs using Calcium Phosphate method (Clontech product #K2051-1).  \\n      The fluorescent intensity of the transfected cells was analyzed on FACS using FL1 (510/30) detecting channel. Five samples were analyzed in parallel for each construct. The observed mean value of FL1 fluorescent intensity of the M1 population of each sample is summarized in Table 3. It shows that the average of the mean value of each construct (Wildtype, Mut15, and Mut32) has no significant difference.  \\n               TABLE 3                          FL1 Fluorescent Intensity of M1 Population                                     Sample #   Wildtype   Mut15   Mut32                                                 1   82.84   106.95   84.51           2   77.52   108.73   91.41           3   111.85   97.08   91.30           4   113.06   90.16   98.16           5   104.95   86.34   111.44           Mean   98.04   97.85   95.36                      \\n \\n G. Generation and Expression of Fusion Protein Mut15-mdm2 \\n \\n      The Mut15-mdm2 fusion was generated by the following steps: first, mdm2 DNA was obtained by amplifying human Marathon cDNA library (Burke&#39;s Lymphoma) using primers: ATGTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC (SEQ ID No.19) and CTAGGGGAAATAAGTTAGCAC (SEQ ID No. 20); secondly, the purified PCR product was then amplified with primers: GGGAATTCCAGCCATGGTGTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC (SEQ ID No. 21) and TCCCCCGGGGGGAAATAAGTTAGCAC (SEQ ID No. 22) in order to add Kozac sequence and restriction sites; thirdly, the purified PCR product from step 2 was digested with EcoR I and Sma I and inserted into EcoR I and SmaI of NFP1Mut15-N1 vector (this vector was generated using BamH I and Not I sites of the pEGFP-N1 backbone). The generated Mut15-mdm2 fusion was then expressed in HEK293cells.  \\n      H. Comparison of the Protein Fluorescent Intensity  \\n      PQE30 amFP486 wildtype, Mut15 and Mut32 were transformed into DH5\u03b1. The bacteria grew in the presence of 1 mM IPTG overnight to induce the protein expression. Cells were lysed in 100 mM Tris, pH8.0 by sonication. Cell lysate was collected after centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. The proteins were purified with TALON\u2122 Meta Affinity Resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). Briefly, after the protein was absorbed on the resin, the beads were washed in stepwise with first wash, then first elution (50 mM imidazole) and second elution (200 mM imidazole) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein is found mostly in the second step elution. It was found that Mut32 has the highest bacterial expression level, while Mut15 has the lowest.  \\n      Samples of each elution fraction were run on SDS-PAGE to check the purity of the proteins. Both wildtype amFP486 and Mut32 show a single band, while Mut5 has two more minor bands with higher molecular weight (data not shown).  \\n      The protein concentration (fractionII-2) was checked and measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad standard assay) using BSA as a standard. The fluorescence intensity (fraction II-2) was determined with a LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B. EX=458 nm, EM=492 nm, both slits=2.5 nm. Table 4 shows the protein concentration, relative fluorescent (FL) intensity and intensity/\u03bcg protein in 700 \u03bcl volume. It shows that Mut32 is as bright as wildtype, while Mut15 is worse than the wildtype.  \\n                               TABLE 4                                           Intensity/\u03bcg           Protein   Relative FL   Protein in 700           Concentration   Intensity   \u03bcl Volume                                                    Wildtype II-2   1.26 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl   37.805/5 \u03bcl   30.00       Mut15II-2   0.64 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl   10.152/5 \u03bcl   15.86       Mut32II-2   6.17 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl   186.474/5 \u03bcl\\u2002   30.22                  \\n \\n III. Characterization of cFP484 and Mutants Thereof (NFP-2) \\n \\n A. Mutant Generation \\n \\n      Two deletion mutants were generated by two separate PCR reactions: A19 cFP484 lacks the N-terminal first 19 amino acids of cFP484, and \u039438 cFP484 lacks the N-terminal first 38 amino acids of cFP484. Mammalian expression vectors containing the DNA encoding the fluorescent protein \u039419 cFP484 or \u039438 cFP484 are generated, which are named as p\u039419 NFP2-N1 and p\u039438 NFP2-N1, respectively.  \\n      B. Transient Expression of Deletion Mutants of cFP484 in Mammalian Cells  \\n      HeLa cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression vector p\u039419 NFP2-N1 which contains the DNA encoding the fluorescent protein \u039419 cFP484. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were mounted in mounting medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Digital images were taken with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.) using a monochrome cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific). The filter set XF 114 (Omega Optical) was used to visualize fluorescence emitted by \u039419 cFP484. The image was pseudocolored. \u039438 cFP484 is also fluorescent when expressed in HeLa cells.  \\n      IV. Characterization of zFP506 and Mutants thereof (NFP-3; ZsGreen)  \\n      A. Mutant Generation  \\n      A mutant of zFP506 was generated, N66M (N65M if numbered according to GFP homology alignment). Compared with wild type zFP506, N66M has the mutation of from \u201cAAC\u201d to \u201cATG\u201d which results in the corresponding amino acid change from Asparagine (N) to Methionine (M) at the position of 66. The spectral properties of N66M are listed in Table 5.  \\n               TABLE 5                          Spectral Properties of the Isolated N66M                                                 Absorbance   Emission   Maximum                   NFP   Maximum   Maximum   Extinction   Quantum   Relative       Species   Name   Nm   nm   Coeff.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n \\n      Non-humanized zFP506 DNA was amplified via PCR and reconstructed into EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Functional test of the generated vector was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of zFP506 was examined under fluorescent microscope. zFP506 showed good fluorescent intensity and comparable to EGFP-N1.  \\n      C. Generation of Destabilized zFP506 Vectors as Transcription Reporters  \\n      Since zFP506 is very stable, it is necessary to generate destabilized versions of zFP506 in order to observe the rapid turnover of the protein. By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, two destabilized zFP506 vectors were constructed by fusing mouse ODC degradation domain to the C-terminal of zFP506. The d1 version of destabilized zFP506 has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain comparing to d2 version, therefore result in a shorter half-life of the protein to which MODC degradation domain fused to. Destabilized d1zFP506 and d2zFP506 were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone  \\n      D. Functional Analysis of Destabilized zFP506  \\n      Wildtype d1zFP506 was transiently transfected into 293 cells. 24 hours after transfection, CHX was added to stop protein synthesis. After 4 hour treatment, cells were examined under fluorescent microscope. It shows that fusion of MODC domain to the zFP506 slightly decreases the fluorescent intensity compared to zFP506 itself. After 4 hour treatment, there is 50% fluorescent intensity decrease.  \\n      E. Application of Destabilized d1zFP506 as Transcription Reporters  \\n      Destabilized d1zFP506 was constructed into pCRE-d1GNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1GNFP vectors. Its expression was regulated under cAMP response element (CRE) or NF-\u03baB response element, respectively. These vectors were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and 24 hours post transfection, the expression of d1GNFP was induced by Forskolin or TNF-\u03b1. 6 hours after induction, the culture was analysed by FACS. CRE-d1GNFP showed 7 fold of induction in fluorescence intensity, while 4 fold of induction was obtained in NF-\u03baB-d1GNFP (data not shown). This demonstrated that the destabilized form of GNFP is applicable as transcription reporters.  \\n      F. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized zFP506 and Humanized N66M  \\n      Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, human favored codon version is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. Each piece of human favored codon oligos was linked to form the full length of wild type and/or mutant zFP506 (hGNFP-zFP506; hGNFP-N65M. This humanized zFP506 was constituted into EGFP-N1 backbone.  \\n      V. Characterization of zFPD-38 and mutants thereof (NFP4; ZsYellow)  \\n      A mutant of zFP538 M129V (as measured from the start of the protein) was generated. M129V (M128V using GFP numbering) was generated by introducing a wrong nucleotide in PCR during site-specific mutagenesis at position 65. One bright yellow colony was obtained, and the sequence of this clone was performed. It showed that this clone contained wild type amino acid Lysine (K) at position 65, but had a substitution from Methionine (M) to Valine (V) at position 129 (numbering from start of protein; at position 128 if numbering according to GFP homology alignment).  \\n      Further investigations showed that M129V has spectral characteristics very similar to wild type protein zFP538 but folds much faster. Table 6 lists the spectral properties of M129V.  \\n               TABLE 6                          Spectral Properties of the Isolated M128V                                                 Absorbance   Emission   Maximum                   NFP   Maximum   Maximum   Extinction   Quantum   Relative       Species   Name   nm   nm   Coeff.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n \\n      Both wildtype (wt) and mutant zFP538 DNA were amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Both pYNFPwt and pYNFPW129V keep the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Functional test of the generated vectors was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, pYNFPwt, pYNFPM129V and EYFP were compared side by side: pYNFPwt showed less fluorescent intensity than EYFP (data not shown); however, pYNFPM129V showed as bright fluorescent intensity as EYFP by fluorescent microscopy.  \\n      B. Generation of Destabilized zFP538 Vectors as Transcription Reporters  \\n      By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, destabilized zFP538 vectors were constructed by fusing different mouse ODC degradation domains such as d1 and d2 to the C-terminal of zFP538. The d1 version of destabilized YNFP has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain compared to d2 version. Vectors pYNFPM128V-MODCd1 and pYNFPM128V-MODCd2 were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone.  \\n      C. Functional Analysis of Destabilized zFP538  \\n      Functional test of the destabilized zFP538 was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, the fluorescent intensity was decreased gradually from d2 and d1 because of the fusion with different mouse ODC degradation domains. After 4-hour treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, d2 fluorescent intensity did not change very much; however, d1 fluorescent intensity decreased further 50% of its original intensity. The half-life of d1 is around 4 hours.  \\n      M129V has fast folding and bright fluorescent intensity, which makes it useful for number of applications. Some fusion proteins were tested such as PKC-gamma-YNFP (M129V). PKC-gamma was observed to translocate from cytosol to the plasma membrane when cells were treated with PMA (Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate).  \\n      D. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized M129V  \\n      Humanized M129V was generated, and then placed into the pEGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as pEGFP-N1. Construction of C1 and pEGFP is in the process.  \\n      E. Structural Characterization of Green Mutant  \\n      1. Analytical Ultracentrifugation:  \\n      Data show zFP538 is non-dissociating trimer of 80 kD/dimer-tetramer equilibrium with S values of about 6 and 8; results not conclusive, but sure that there is more than one species.  \\n      2. Structure:  \\n      Tetramer, extremely similar to DsRed; no idea why wildtype is yellow, chromophore is identical to that of GFP; although the tetramers of dsRed and zFP538 are essentially identical in the overall configuration and in the positioning of the interfacial regions, the residues involved in interfacial contacts are not conserved. This finding indicates that a lot of variability is tolerated and monomers can be created.  \\n      VI. Characterization of dsFP483 and Mutants Thereof (NFP-5)  \\n      Mutants of NFP-5 include (according to GFP numbering): N68S; I112S; and N68S/I112S.  \\n      VII. Characterization of drFP583 and Mutants Thereof (NFP-6; DsRed; DsRed2)  \\n      A. Expression in Mammalian Cells  \\n      HeLa cells were transfected either with plasmid pDsRed1-N1 (vector containing the DNA encoding drFP583) or plasmid pEGFP-C1 (encoding EGFP from  Aequorea victoria ). Immediately after the transfection, cells were mixed and plated on coverslips. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were mounted in mounting medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken from the same field of view with Chroma filter set 31001 for EGFP and filter set 31002 for drFP583 using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). The images were pseudocolored and overlayed. Phase contrast was taken from the same field of view and overlayed.  \\n      B. Generation of Humanized drFP583  \\n      Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, human favored codon version is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. Humanized drFP583 was therefore generated by changing wild type drFP583 nucleotide sequence to optimize the codons for expression of the fluorescent protein. The nucleotide sequence of this humanized mutant is provided in  FIG. 16 .  \\n      C. Expression of Humanized drFP583 in Mammalian Cells  \\n      HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids pECFP-Nuc, pEYFP-Tub and pDsRed1-Mito (humanized drFP583). After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were mounted in mounting medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken of one cell co-expressing all three fluorescent proteins with Omega filter set XF 35 for DsRed1-Mito, XF 104 for EYFP-Tub and XF 114 for ECFP-Nuc using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Individual images were pseudocolored and overlayed to show all three signals in one image. Protein DsRed1-Mito localizes to mitochondria, EYFP-Tub localizes to the microtubular network, and ECFP-Nuc localizes to the nucleus.  \\n      As a conclusion, drFP583 does emit to a low extent also in the cyan (ECFP), green (EGFP) and yellow-green (EYFP) emission channels (filter sets). High expression levels or highly concentrated protein in intracellular structures can therefore result in high signal intensities that will give some bleedthrough in the other emission wavelengths. The bleedthrough is small and should not affect multiple labeling recording in most cases.  \\n      D. Mutants of Humanized drFP583  \\n      Mutants of humanized drFP583 were generated using error prone PCR technique (Clontech). Mutations occurred at amino acids 42, 71, 105, 120, 161 and 197 (numbering starting from the first Methionine). Table 7 lists the mutants that were generated and their properties.  \\n               TABLE 7                          Mutants of Humanized drFP583                         Mutant   Mutations   Properties               E5   V105A, S197T   Overnight in  E. coli  emitting green               fluorescence; in vitro maturing to red               over 28 h at 37\u00b0 C. on 80% (retains               20% green peak); folding faster than               wild type drFP583 (\u02dc28 h)       E8   N42H   Always two peaks green &amp; red (\u02dc1:1)               folding faster than E5 (\u02dc8 h)       E5up   V105A   red from the beginning; folding faster               than E5 (\u02dc12 h)       E5   S197T   phenotype is similar to E5       down       E57   V105A,   like E5 but folding faster (\u02dc8-10 h);           I161T, S197A   \u02dc5% of green peak left at the end               (See  FIG. 18 )       AG4   V71M, V105A,   bright green, no red at all; fast           S197T   folding (\u02dc16 h)       AG45   V71M, V105A,   like AG4 but twice brighter           Y120H, S197T       FP6   R2A, K5E, K9T,   Non-aggregating (See  FIG. 19 )       (E57)-   V105A, I161T,       NA:   S197A.       E5-NA:   R2A, K5E, K9T,   (non-aggregating Fluorescent Timer)           V105A, S197T   (See  FIG. 17 )       E83   N42H,           V71A, I180V                  \\n \\n E. Characterization and Applications of E5 Mutant \\n \\n      E5 (V105A, S197T) changes its fluorescence from green to red over time both in vitro and in vivo, in  E. coli  and in mammalian cells. Also, E5 folds faster than wild type drFP583 both in.  E. coli  and mammalian cells.  \\n      Since it allows the \u201ctwo color\u201d reporting mode for monitoring of the promoter activity, i.e., for both active or shutdown state of the promoter, there is a separate color, serving as an indicator of that state, E5 can be used as a transcriptional reporter. Different from \u201cone color\u201d mode, \u201ctwo color\u201d mode has a measurable signal (color) present for both states of the process as opposed to \u201cone color\u201d mode (e.g. destabilized GFP) wherein the absence of the color is an indicator of the second state. Namely, newly produced E5 protein fluoresces in green, indicating on-going promoter activity. Over time, the protein will mature, acquiring the red fluorescence. So if the promoter is no longer active, all the protein will eventually mature, resulting in the dominant red fluorescence. In case the promoter is still active both red and green fluorescence will be readily detected. Thus E5 as a \u201ctwo color\u201d reporter allows study of gene expression similar to destabilized GFP, but with permanent \u201csignature\u201d of past gene activity in the cells, tissues or entire organism. For example, at the tissue level, E5 may help to distinguish the stem cells from differentiated cells. Providing the promoter is only active in the stem cells, the E5 reporter will label the stem cell population in green and red, the progenitor cells would be labeled predominantly in red, the terminally differentiated will not fluoresce (due to the titration out of protein during cell division).  \\n      E5 can be used for spatial and temporal visualization of newly synthesized vs. accumulated fusion proteins. That is, E5 could function like a fusion tag. Possible applications envisaged at different organizational levels. At the cellular level, E5 may help to visualize and distinguish the newly synthesized proteins in various compartments such as outer membrane, microvillae, ER, Golgi, mitochondria, nuclei, various components of cellular matrix and focal adhesion complexes. At the tissue level, E5 may be helpful in visualizing newly formed vs. preexisting structures e.g. membrane junctions, components of extracellular matrix.  \\n      One of the most fascinating applications of E5 seems to be in the study of the mother-daughter relationship during the cell division and migration. A wide horizon is opening in the fields of development as well as in the adult organisms to study the cell migration and differentiation. Allowing visualization of the expression \u201chistory\u201d, E5 can help to distinguishing between the mother cells where the promoter is actually active vs. the daughter cells containing the accumulated protein but not producing fresh protein anymore. It would enable the study of the cell fates during development and organ remodeling, thus distinguishing between cell migration and cell expansion or differentiation.  \\n      In conclusion, E5 is basically applicable to any situation where GFP was previously used. Main advantage is that E5 can track down \u201cthe history\u201d of promoter activity or protein localization in cells or tissues. With a better protein stability than GFP, E5 allows longer analysis window (wild type drFP583 is stable for at least 4 weeks in  Xenopus , while EGFP starts to faint after two weeks).  \\n      F. Characterization and Applications of E8 Mutant  \\n      E8 (N42H) has two fluorescence maximums, green and red, at all times and it folds much faster than drFP583 (Table 7).  \\n      Since it detects both green and red fluorescence simultaneously, E8 may be useful for studying processes related to blood circulation and proteins/cells trafficking. Blood absorbs the green fluorescence; thus only the red fluorescence will be visible while the protein is trafficking in the blood. Both green and red fluorescence could be detected outside the bloodstream making the whole process easy to visualize and record. Monitoring both red and green fluorescence simultaneously may also help to reduce the background fluorescence problems for some tissues or cell&#39;s.  \\n      G. Generation of drFP583/dmFP592 Hybrid Using Shuffling Procedure  \\n      Non-humanized wild type coding region fragments from drFP583 and dmFP592 were amplified by PCR (22 cycles, 95\u00b0 C., 15 sec., 68\u00b0 C. 1 min 20 sec.) using 1 ng of corresponding bacterial expression plasmids (pQE-30 derivatives with drFP583 and dmFP592 inserts, respectively) as templates. Oligonucleotides  \\n      A (ACATGG ATCCAGGTCTTCCAAGAATGTTATC, SEQ ID No. 23),  \\n      B (TAGTACTCG AGCCAAGTTCAGCCTTA, SEQ ID No. 24),  \\n      C (ACATGGATCCAG TTGTTC CAAGAATGTGAT, SEQ ID No. 25), and  \\n      D (TAGTACTCGAGGCCATTA CCGCTAATC, SEQ ID No. 26)  \\n      were used as primers for amplifying these fragments in a concentration of 0.2 mM.  \\n      The PCR products were then purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). Afterwards, the purified fragments drFP583 and dmFP592 (300-500 ng each) were digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, HindIII and DraI (10 U each) simultaneously. Reactions were performed in BamHI restriction buffer (NEB) supplemented BSA for 3 h at 37\u00b0 C. Total reaction volume was 30 ml. Upon completion, the resulted restriction fragments from each restriction reaction were separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels (1.5%), cut from gel and purified by QIAquick Gel Purification Kit (QIAGEN). The resulting sets of the purified restriction fragments from both drFP583 and dmFP592 were combined together and 50 ng of them were put into ligation mix (1\u00d7T4 DNA ligation buffer, 400 NEB U of T4 DNA ligase) in total volume of 30 ml. The ligation was performed for 3 h at room temperature and stopped by heating at 70\u00b0 C. within 20 min.  \\n      The ligation mixture was then diluted by Water ten-folds, and 1 ml of the dilution was preformed for PCR reaction (20 cycles, 95\u00b0 C., 15 sec. 68\u00b0 C. 1 min 20 sec) as template. Four oligonucleotides A, B, C, and D (SEQ ID Nos. 58-61, respectively) were used simultaneously as primers for amplifying these fragments in a concentration of 0.1 mM each. After electrophoresis in an agarose gel (1.5%), the target fragment was purified by QIAquick Gel Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and digested with restriction endonucleases BamHI and XhoI (30-50 U each) simultaneously in BamH I restriction buffer (NEB) supplemented with BSA for 3 h at 37\u00b0 C. After purification, the resulting fragment was cloned in pQE-30 plasmid linearized by BamHI and SalI. Ligation reaction was performed in 1\u00d7 T4 DNA ligation buffer and 400 NEB U of T4 DNA ligase with a total volume of 20 ml for overnight at 16\u00b0 C. After transformation of  E. coli  cells by 1/5 of the ligation volume and incubation on LB/1% agar plates which were supplemented by 100 mg/ml Ampacilin and 0.1 mM IPTG at 37\u00b0 C. for overnight, the resulting  E. coli  colonies were screened visually under fluorescent microscope using rhodamine filter set. The brightest red colonies were picked up and placed in 200 ml LB medium with 100 mg/ml of Ampacilin. At OD 600 =0.6, the  E. coli  culture was induced by IPTG (final concentration was 1 mM) and the fermentation continued for overnight. Purification of recombinant protein containing N-terminus 6\u00d7 his tag was performed using TALON metal-affinity resin according to manufacturer&#39;s protocol.  \\n      H. Spectral Properties of drFP583/dmFP592 Hybrid  \\n      The emission and excitation spectra for drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid protein are basically the same as for dmFP592. Table 8 lists the spectral properties of drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid protein.  \\n               TABLE 8                          Spectral Properties of drFP583/dmFP592 Hybrid                                                 Maximum   Relative               Absorbance   Emission   Extinction   Quantum   Relative       nFP Name   Maximum nm   Maximum nm   Coeff.

Humanized drFP583/dmFP592 Hybrid and Mutants \\n \\n      drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid was humanized. Further, two mutants were generated based on the humanized drFP583/dmFP592, i.e., drFP583/dmFP592-2G and drFP583/dmFP592-Q3. drFP583/dmFP592-2G (i.e. 6/92G) contains two substitutions, K15Q and T217S (Self numbering). This mutant was derived from the humanized drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid gene by random mutagenesis using Diversity PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech) according to the corresponding protocol. drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 (6/9Q) contains three substitutions, K15Q and K83M and T217S (self numbering). drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 mutant was derived from drFP583/dmFP592-2G mutant by random mutagenesis using Diversity PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech) according to the corresponding protocol. A non-aggregating mutant of 6/9Q, i.e. 6/9 QNA, was also produced, which the following substitutions: K5E, K9T, K15Q, K83M, T217S (self numbering). The sequences of a humanized 6/9 Q hybrid protein are provided in  FIG. 22 .  \\n      drFP583/dmFP592-2G has similar brightness and folding rate as for non-humanized drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid. While drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 could be seen in  E. coli  cells as more dark red than parental variant, i.e., drFP583/dmFP592-2G, and the purified protein solution has purple color. drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 has the emission maximum of 616 nm and excitation maximum of 580 nm.  \\n      J. Applications of Hybrid Mutants  \\n      Similar to fluorescent protein drFP583 or dmFP592, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 can be used as a tool for investigation of protein expression, transport and protein interactions in vivo, monitoring of promoter activity, and as a transcription reporter or fusion tag. Besides, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 can be chosen as the most convenient partner to one of the existing green fluorescent protein variants in two/triple color labeling assays for simultaneous detection of expression of two or more proteins in vivo due to its strongly red-shifted position of emission maximum and practical absence of excitation in green part of spectrum except any spectral overlapping and background fluorescence.  \\n      The method of generating drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid can have a general utility for generating hybrid genes (i.e., genes containing parts of different genes in various combinations) with improved fluorescent characteristics.  \\n      Additionally, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 is the first red-shifted mutant, which demonstrates that spectral-shifted mutant could be obtained by random mutagenesis.  \\n      K.

Characterization of asFP600 and Mutants thereof (NFP-7; AsRed) \\n \\n A. Mutant Generation \\n \\n      A mutant of asFP600 was generated, Mut1. Compared with wild type asFP600, Mut1 has the following substitutions: T68A and A143S from start of protein (T to A at position 70 and A to S at position 148 under numbering according to GFP). Target substitution A143S was generated by means of site-specific mutagenesis using PCR with primers that carried the mutation. During this mutagenesis random substitution T68A was generated by introducing a wrong nucleotide in PCR. The substitution T68A is not necessary for fluorescence and practically does not affect the fluorescence. Table 9 lists the spectral properties of Mut1. Another mutant of asFP600 was generated, having a substitution of the Alanine at position 184 to Serine (according to GFP numbering).  \\n               TABLE 9                          Spectral Properties of the Isolated Mut1                                                 Absorbance   Emission   Maximum                   NFP   Maximum   Maximum   Extinction   Quantum   Relative       Species   Name   Nm   nm   Coeff.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n \\n      Non-humanized mutant asFP600 (RNFP) DNA were amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector (pRNFP-N1) has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1.  \\n      Functional test of the generated vector was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of asFP600 was examined under fluorescent microscope. asFP600 showed good fluorescent intensity, however, the expression of asFP600 concentrated at the nucleus.  \\n      C. Generation of Cytosal Expressed asFP600  \\n      Since the nuclear localization of asFP600 limited some of the application of this protein as transcription reporter or pH sensor, cytosal expression of this protein would be needed for this purpose. A nuclear export sequence in humanized codon usage was fused to the N-terminus of asFP600, and placed into the EGFP-N1 vector, resulted in pNE-RNFP.  \\n      Functional test of NE-RNFP is performed by transient transfect the pNE-RNFP into 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of NE-RNFP is examined under fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence was observed to be distributed in the cytosol but not in the nucleus.  \\n      D. Generation of Destabilized asFP600 Vectors as Transcription Reporters  \\n      Since asFP600 is very stable, it is necessary to generate destabilized versions of asFP600 in order to observe the rapid turnover of the protein. By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, two destabilized NE-RNFP vectors were constructed by fusing mouse ODC degradation domain to the C-terminal of NE-RNFP. The d1 version of destabilized RNFP has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain comparing to d2 version, therefore result in a shorter half-life of the protein to which MODC degradation domain fused. Destabilized d1 RNFP and d2RNFP were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone.  \\n      E. Functional Analysis of Destabilized asFP600  \\n      d2 version of the none-humanized asFP600 was transiently transfected into 293 cells. One day after transfection, CHX was added to inhibit protein synthesis. 3 hours after treatment, cells were examined under fluorescent microscope. It showed that fluorescent intensity decreased \u02dc50%.  \\n      F. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized Mut1  \\n      Humanized Mut1 was generated. The humanized Mut1 was then placed into the pEGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as pEGFP-N1. Construction of C1 and pEGFP is in the process.  \\n      It is evident from the above discussion and results that the subject invention provides important new chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins and nucleic acids encoding the same, where the subject proteins and nucleic acids find use in a variety of different applications. As such, the subject invention represents a significant contribution to the art.  \\n      IX.

Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.

This term refers only to the primary and secondary structure of the molecule, and does not limit it to any particular tertiary forms. Thus, this term includes double-stranded DNA found, inter alia, in linear DNA molecules (e.g., restriction fragments), viruses, plasmids, and chromosomes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\"> A DNA \u201ccoding sequence\u201d is a DNA sequence which is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide in vivo when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The boundaries of the coding sequence are determined by a start codon at the 5\u2032 (amino) terminus and a translation stop codon at the 3\u2032 (carboxyl) terminus. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited to, prokaryotic sequences, cDNA from eukaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA sequences from eukaryotic (e.g., mammalian) DNA, and synthetic DNA sequences. A polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence may be located 3\u2032 to the coding sequence. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\"> As used herein, the term \u201chybridization\u201d refers to the process of association of two nucleic acid strands to form an antiparallel duplex stabilized by means of hydrogen bonding between residues of the opposite nucleic acid strands. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\"> The term \u201coligonucleotide\u201d refers to a short (under 100 bases in length) nucleic acid molecule. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\"> \u201cDNA regulatory sequences\u201d, as used herein, are transcriptional and translational control sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, terminators, and the like, that provide for and/or regulate expression of a coding sequence in a host cell. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\"> A \u201cpromoter sequence\u201d is a DNA regulatory region capable of binding RNA polymerase in a cell and initiating transcription of a downstream (3\u2032 direction) coding sequence. For purposes of defining the present invention, the promoter sequence is bounded at its 3\u2032 terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5\u2032 direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at levels detectable above background. Within the promoter sequence will be found a transcription initiation site, as well as protein binding domains responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. Eukaryotic promoters will often, but not always, contain \u201cTATA\u201d boxes and \u201cCAT\u201d boxes. Various promoters, including inducible promoters, may be used to drive the various vectors of the present invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\"> As used herein, the terms \u201crestriction endonucleases\u201d and \u201crestriction enzymes\u201d refer to bacterial enzymes, each of which cut double-stranded DNA at or near a specific nucleotide sequence. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\"> A cell has been \u201ctransformed\u201d or \u201ctransfected\u201d by exogenous or heterologous DNA when such DNA has been introduced inside the cell. The transforming DNA may or may not be integrated (covalently linked) into the genome of the cell. In prokaryotes, yeast, and mammalian cells for example, the transforming DNA may be maintained on an episomal element such as a plasmid. With respect to eukaryotic cells, a stably transformed cell is one in which the transforming DNA has become integrated into a chromosome so that it is inherited by daughter cells through chromosome replication. This stability is demonstrated by the ability of the eukaryotic cell to establish cell lines or clones comprised of a population of daughter cells containing the transforming DNA. A \u201cclone\u201d is a population of cells derived from a single cell or common ancestor by mitosis. A \u201ccell line\u201d is a clone of a primary cell that is capable of stable growth in vitro for many generations. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\"> A \u201cheterologous\u201d region of the DNA construct is an identifiable segment of DNA within a larger DNA molecule that is not found in association with the larger molecule in nature. Thus, when the heterologous region encodes a mammalian gene, the gene will usually be flanked by DNA that does not flank the mammalian genomic DNA in the genome of the source organism. In another example, heterologous DNA includes coding sequence in a construct where portions of genes from two different sources have been brought together so as to produce a fusion protein product. Allelic variations or naturally-occurring mutational events do not give rise to a heterologous region of DNA as defined herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\"> As used herein, the term \u201creporter gene\u201d refers to a coding sequence attached to heterologous promoter or enhancer elements and whose product may be assayed easily and quantifiably when the construct is introduced into tissues or cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\"> The amino acids described herein are preferred to be in the \u201cL\u201d isomeric form. The amino acid sequences are given in one-letter code (A: alanine; C: cysteine; D: aspartic acid; E: glutamic acid; F: phenylalanine; G: glycine; H: histidine; I: isoleucine; K: lysine; L: leucine; M: methionine; N: asparagine; P: proline; Q: glutamine; R: arginine; S: serine; T: threonine; V: valine; W: tryptophan; Y: tyrosine; X: any residue). NH<sub>2 </sub>refers to the free amino group present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide. COOH refers to the free carboxy group present at the carboxy terminus of a polypeptide. In keeping with standard polypeptide nomenclature, <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>243 (1969), 3552-59 is used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\"> The term \u201cimmunologically active\u201d defines the capability of the natural, recombinant or synthetic chromo/fluorescent protein, or any oligopeptide thereof, to induce a specific immune response in appropriate animals or cells and to bind with specific antibodies. As used herein, \u201cantigenic amino acid sequence\u201d means an amino acid sequence that, either alone or in association with a carrier molecule, can elicit an antibody response in a mammal. The term \u201cspecific binding,\u201d in the context of antibody binding to an antigen, is a term well understood in the art and refers to binding of an antibody to the antigen to which the antibody was raised, but not other, unrelated antigens. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\"> As used herein the term \u201cisolated\u201d is meant to describe a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an antibody, or a host cell that is in an environment different from that in which the polynucleotide, the polypeptide, the antibody, or the host cell naturally occurs. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\"> Bioluminescence (BL) is defined as emission of light by living organisms that is well visible in the dark and affects visual behavior of animals (See e.g., Harvey, E. N. (1952). <i>Bioluminescence</i>. New York: Academic Press; Hastings, J. W. (1995). Bioluminescence. In: <i>Cell Physiology </i>(ed. by N. Speralakis). pp. 651-681. New York: Academic Press.; Wilson, T. and Hastings, J. W. (1998). Bioluminescence. <i>Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol </i>14, 197-230.). Bioluminescence does not include so-called ultra-weak light emission, which can be detected in virtually all living structures using sensitive luminometric equipment (Murphy, M. E. and Sies, H.(1990). Visible-range low-level chemiluminescence in biological systems. <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>186, 595-610; Radotic, K, Radenovic, C, Jeremic, M. (1998.) Spontaneous ultra-weak bioluminescence in plants: origin, mechanisms and properties. <i>Gen Physiol Biophys </i>17, 289-308), and from weak light emission which most probably does not play any ecological role, such as the glowing of bamboo growth cone (Totsune, H., Nakano, M., Inaba, H.(1993). Chemiluminescence from bamboo shoot cut. <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res Comm. </i>194, 1025-1029) or emission of light during fertilization of animal eggs (Klebanoff, S. J., Froeder, C. A., Eddy, E.

Although any methods, devices and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods, devices and materials are now described. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\"> All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing the cell lines, vectors, methodologies and other invention components that are described in the publications which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\"> In further describing the subject invention, the subject nucleic acid compositions will be described first, followed by a discussion of the subject protein compositions, antibody compositions and transgenic cells/organisms.

By chromo and/or fluorescent protein is meant a protein that is colored, i.e., is pigmented, where the protein may or may not be fluorescent, e.g., it may exhibit low, medium or high fluorescence upon irradiation with light of an excitation wavelength. In any event, the subject proteins of interest are those in which the colored characteristic, i.e., the chromo and/or fluorescent characteristic, is one that arises from the interaction of two or more residues of the protein, and not from a single residue, more specifically a single side chain of a single residue, of the protein. As such, fluorescent proteins of the subject invention do not include proteins that exhibit fluorescence only from residues that act by themselves as intrinsic fluors, i.e., tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. As such, the fluorescent proteins of the subject invention are fluorescent proteins whose fluorescence arises from some structure in the protein that is other than the above specified single residues, e.g., it arises from an interaction of two or more residues. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\"> By nucleic acid composition is meant a composition comprising a sequence of DNA having an open reading frame that encodes a chromo/fluoro polypeptide of the subject invention, i.e., a chromo/fluoroprotein gene, and is capable, under appropriate conditions, of being expressed as a chromo/fluoro protein according to the subject invention. Also encompassed in this term are nucleic acids that are homologous, substantially similar or identical to the nucleic acids of the present invention. Thus, the subject invention provides genes and coding sequences thereof encoding the proteins of the subject invention, as well as homologs thereof. The subject nucleic acids are present in other than their natural environment, e.g., they are isolated, present in enriched amounts, etc., from their naturally occurring environment, e.g., the organism from which they are obtained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\"> The nucleic acids are further characterized in that they encode proteins that are either from: (1) non-bioluminescent species, often non-bioluminescent Cnidarian species, e.g., non-bioluminescent Anthozoan species; or (2) from Anthozoan species that are not Pennatulacean species, i.e., that are not sea pens. As such, the nucleic acids may encode proteins from bioluminescent Anthozoan species, so long as these species are not Pennatulacean species, e.g., that are not Renillan or Ptilosarcan species.

The wild type cDNA coding sequence for dmFP592 is provided in SEQ ID NO: 17. In addition to nucleic acids encoding the wild type sequence and fragments thereof, also of interest are nucleic acids that encode homologues and mutants of the wild type protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\"> In addition to the above described specific nucleic acid compositions, also of interest are homologues of the above sequences. With respect to homologues of the subject nucleic acids, the source of homologous genes may be any species of plant or animal or the sequence may be wholly or partially synthetic. In certain embodiments, sequence similarity between homologues is at least about 20%, sometimes at least about 25%, and may be 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or higher, including 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% and 95% or higher. Sequence similarity is calculated based on a reference sequence, which may be a subset of a larger sequence, such as a conserved motif, coding region, flanking region, etc. A reference sequence will usually be at least about 18 nt long, more usually at least about 30 nt long, and may extend to the complete sequence that is being compared. Algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art, such as BLAST, described in Altschul et al. (1990), <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403-10 (using default settings, i.e. parameters w=4 and T=17). The sequences provided herein are essential for recognizing related and homologous nucleic acids in database searches. Of particular interest in certain embodiments are nucleic acids of substantially the same length as the nucleic acid identified as SEQ ID NOS: 01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, or 17, where by substantially the same length is meant that any difference in length does not exceed about 20 number %, usually does not exceed about 10 number % and more usually does not exceed about 5 number %; and have sequence identity to any of these sequences of at least about 90%, usually at least about 95% and more usually at least about 99% over the entire length of the nucleic acid. In many embodiments, the nucleic acids have a sequence that is substantially similar (i.e. the same as) or identical to the sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, or 17. By substantially similar is meant that sequence identity will generally be at least about 60%, usually at least about 75% and often at least about 80, 85, 90, or even 95%. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\"> Also provided are nucleic acids that encode the proteins encoded by the above described nucleic acids, but differ in sequence from the above described nucleic acids due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\"> Also provided are nucleic acids that hybridize to the above described nucleic acid under stringent conditions. An example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization at 50\u00b0 C. or higher and 0.1\u00d7SSC (15 mM sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Another example of stringent hybridization conditions is overnight incubation at 42\u00b0 C. in a solution: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH7.6), 5\u00d7 Denhardt&#39;s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 \u03bcg/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1\u00d7SSC at about 65\u00b0 C. Stringent hybridization conditions are hybridization conditions that are at least as stringent as the above representative conditions, where conditions are considered to be at least as stringent if they are at least about 80% as stringent, typically at least about 90% as stringent as the above specific stringent conditions. Other stringent hybridization conditions are known in the art and may also be employed to identify nucleic acids of this particular embodiment of the invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\"> Nucleic acids encoding mutants of the proteins of the invention are also provided. Mutant nucleic acids can be generated by random mutagenesis or targeted mutagenesis, using well-known techniques which are routine in the art. In some embodiments, chromo- or fluorescent proteins encoded by nucleic acids encoding homologues or mutants have the same fluorescent properties as the wild-type fluorescent protein. In other embodiments, homologue or mutant nucleic acids encode chromo- or fluorescent proteins with altered spectral properties, as described in more detail herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\"> One category of mutant that is of particular interest is the non-aggregating mutant. In many embodiments, the non-aggregating mutant differs from the wild type sequence by a mutation in the N-terminus that modulates the charges appearing on side groups of the N-terminus residues, e.g., to reverse or neutralize the charge, in a manner sufficient to produce a non-aggregating mutant of the naturally occurring protein or mutant, where a particular protein is considered to be non-aggregating if it is determined be non-aggregating using the assay reported in U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/270,983, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. More specifically, basic residues located near the N-termini of the proteins are substituted, e.g., Lys and Arg residues close to the N-terminus are substituted with negatively charged or neutral residues. Specific non-aggregating mutants of interest include, but are not limited to: FP1-NA; FP3-NA; FP4-NA; FP6-NA; E5-NA; 6/9Q-NA; 7A-NA; and the like, where these particular non-aggregating mutants are further described infra. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\"> Another category of mutant of particular interest is the modulated oligomerization mutant. A mutant is considered to be a modulated oligomerization mutant if its oligomerization properties are different as compared to the wild type protein. For example, if a particular mutant oligomerizes to a greater or lesser extent than the wild type, it is considered to be an oligomerization mutant. Of particular interest are oligomerization mutants that do not oligomerize, i.e., are monomers under physiological (e.g., intracellular) conditions, or oligomerize to a lesser extent that the wild type, e.g., are dimers or trimers under intracellular conditions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\"> Nucleic acids of the subject invention may be cDNA or genomic DNA or a fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the nucleic acids of the subject invention include one or more of the open reading frames encoding specific fluorescent proteins and polypeptides, and introns, as well as adjacent 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding nucleotide sequences involved in the regulation of expression, up to about 20 kb beyond the coding region, but possibly further in either direction. The subject nucleic acids may be introduced into an appropriate vector for extrachromosomal maintenance or for integration into a host genome, as described in greater detail below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\"> The term \u201ccDNA\u201d as used herein is intended to include all nucleic acids that share the arrangement of sequence elements found in native mature mRNA species, where sequence elements are exons and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions. Normally mRNA species have contiguous exons, with the intervening introns, when present, being removed by nuclear RNA splicing, to create a continuous open reading frame encoding the protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\"> A genomic sequence of interest comprises the nucleic acid present between the initiation codon and the stop codon, as defined in the listed sequences, including all of the introns that are normally present in a native chromosome. It may further include 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 un-translated regions found in the mature mRNA. It may further include specific transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, etc., including about 1 kb, but possibly more, of flanking genomic DNA at either the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the transcribed region. The genomic DNA may be isolated as a fragment of 100 kbp or smaller; and substantially free of flanking chromosomal sequence. The genomic DNA flanking the coding region, either 3\u2032 or 5\u2032, or internal regulatory sequences as sometimes found in introns, contains sequences required for proper tissue and stage specific expression. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\"> The nucleic acid compositions of the subject invention may encode all or a part of the subject proteins. Double or single stranded fragments may be obtained from the DNA sequence by chemically synthesizing oligonucleotides in accordance with conventional methods, by restriction enzyme digestion, by PCR amplification, etc. For the most part, DNA fragments will be of at least about 15 nt, usually at least about 18 nt or about 25 nt, and may be at least about 50 nt. In some embodiments, the subject nucleic acid molecules may be about 100 nt, about 200 nt, about 300 nt, about 400 nt, about 500 nt, about 600 nt, about 700 nt, or about 720 nt in length. The subject nucleic acids may encode fragments of the subject proteins or the full-length proteins, e.g., the subject nucleic acids may encode polypeptides of about 25 aa, about 50 aa, about 75 aa, about 100 aa, about 125 aa, about 150 aa, about 200 aa, about 210 aa, about 220 aa, about 230 aa, or about 240 aa, up to the entire protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\"> The subject nucleic acids are isolated and obtained in substantial purity, generally as other than an intact chromosome. Usually, the DNA will be obtained substantially free of other nucleic acid sequences that do not include a nucleic acid of the subject invention or fragment thereof, generally being at least about 50%, usually at least about 90% pure and are typically \u201crecombinant\u201d, i.e. flanked by one or more nucleotides with which it is not normally associated on a naturally occurring chromosome. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\"> The subject polynucleotides (e.g., a polynucleotide having a sequence of SEQ ID NOS: 01 to 17 etc.), the corresponding cDNA, the full-length gene and constructs of the subject polynucleotides are provided. These molecules can be generated synthetically by a number of different protocols known to those of skill in the art. Appropriate polynucleotide constructs are purified using standard recombinant DNA techniques as described in, for example, Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, </i>2nd Ed., (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., and under current regulations described in United States Dept. of HHS, National Institute of Health (NIH) Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\"> Also provided are nucleic acids that encode fusion proteins of the subject proteins, or fragments thereof, which are fused to a second protein, e.g., a degradation sequence, a signal peptide, etc. Fusion proteins may comprise a subject polypeptide, or fragment thereof, and a non-Anthozoan polypeptide (\u201cthe fusion partner\u201d) fused in-frame at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the subject polypeptide. Fusion partners include, but are not limited to, polypeptides that can bind antibody specific to the fusion partner (e.g., epitope tags); antibodies or binding fragments thereof; polypeptides that provide a catalytic function or induce a cellular response; ligands or receptors or mimetics thereof; and the like. In such fusion proteins, the fusion partner is generally not naturally associated with the subject Anthozoan portion of the fusion protein, and is typically not an Anthozoan protein or derivative/fragment thereof, i.e., it is not found in Anthozoan species. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\"> Also provided are constructs comprising the subject nucleic acids inserted into a vector, where such constructs may be used for a number of different applications, including propagation, protein production, etc. Viral and non-viral vectors may be prepared and used, including plasmids. The choice of vector will depend on the type of cell in which propagation is desired and the purpose of propagation. Certain vectors are useful for amplifying and making large amounts of the desired DNA sequence. Other vectors are suitable for expression in cells in culture. Still other vectors are suitable for transfer and expression in cells in a whole animal or person. The choice of appropriate vector is well within the skill of the art. Many such vectors are available commercially. To prepare the constructs, the partial or full-length polynucleotide is inserted into a vector typically by means of DNA ligase attachment to a cleaved restriction enzyme site in the vector. Alternatively, the desired nucleotide sequence can be inserted by homologous recombination in vivo. Typically this is accomplished by attaching regions of homology to the vector on the flanks of the desired nucleotide sequence. Regions of homology are added by ligation of oligonucleotides, or by polymerase chain reaction using primers comprising both the region of homology and a portion of the desired nucleotide sequence, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\"> Also provided are expression cassettes or systems that find use in, among other applications, the synthesis of the subject proteins. For expression, the gene product encoded by a polynucleotide of the invention is expressed in any convenient expression system, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, insect, amphibian and mammalian systems. Suitable vectors and host cells are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,173. In the expression vector, a subject polynucleotide, e.g., as set forth in SEQ ID NOS:01; 03; 05; 07; 09; 11; 13; 15 or 17, is linked to a regulatory sequence as appropriate to obtain the desired expression properties. These regulatory sequences can include promoters (attached either at the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand or at the 3\u2032 end of the antisense strand), enhancers, terminators, operators, repressors, and inducers. The promoters can be regulated or constitutive. In some situations it may be desirable to use conditionally active promoters, such as tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific promoters. These are linked to the desired nucleotide sequence using the techniques described above for linkage to vectors. Any techniques known in the art can be used. In other words, the expression vector will provide a transcriptional and translational initiation region, which may be inducible or constitutive, where the coding region is operably linked under the transcriptional control of the transcriptional initiation region, and a transcriptional and translational termination region. These control regions may be native to the subject species from which the subject nucleic acid is obtained, or may be derived from exogenous sources. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\"> Expression vectors generally have convenient restriction sites located near the promoter sequence to provide for the insertion of nucleic acid sequences encoding heterologous proteins. A selectable marker operative in the expression host may be present. Expression vectors may be used for, among other things, the production of fusion proteins, as described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\"> Expression cassettes may be prepared comprising a transcription initiation region, the gene or fragment thereof, and a transcriptional termination region. Of particular interest is the use of sequences that allow for the expression of functional epitopes or domains, usually at least about 8 amino acids in length, more usually at least about 15 amino acids in length, to about 25 amino acids, and up to the complete open reading frame of the gene. After introduction of the DNA, the cells containing the construct may be selected by means of a selectable marker, the cells expanded and then used for expression. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\"> The above described expression systems may be employed with prokaryotes or eukaryotes in accordance with conventional ways, depending upon the purpose for expression. For large scale production of the protein, a unicellular organism, such as <i>E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae</i>, insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors, or cells of a higher organism such as vertebrates, e.g. COS 7 cells, HEK 293, CHO, <i>Xenopus </i>Oocytes, etc., may be used as the expression host cells. In some situations, it is desirable to express the gene in eukaryotic cells, where the expressed protein will benefit from native folding and post-translational modifications. Small peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory. Polypeptides that are subsets of the complete protein sequence may be used to identify and investigate parts of the protein important for function. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\"> Specific expression systems of interest include bacterial, yeast, insect cell and mammalian cell derived expression systems.

Mammalian expression is accomplished as described in Dijkema et al., <i>EMBO J</i>. (1985)4:761, Gorman et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>.

The product is recovered by any appropriate means known in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\"> Once the gene corresponding to a selected polynucleotide is identified, its expression can be regulated in the cell to which the gene is native. For example, an endogenous gene of a cell can be regulated by an exogenous regulatory sequence inserted into the genome of the cell at location sufficient to at least enhance expressed of the gene in the cell. The regulatory sequence may be designed to integrate into the genome via homologous recombination, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,641,670 and 5,733,761, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference, or may be designed to integrate into the genome via non-homologous recombination, as described in WO 99/15650, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. As such, also encompassed in the subject invention is the production of the subject proteins without manipulation of the encoding nucleic acid itself, but instead through integration of a regulatory sequence into the genome of cell that already includes a gene encoding the desired protein, as described in the above incorporated patent documents. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\"> Also provided are homologs of the subject nucleic acids. Homologs are identified by any of a number of methods. A fragment of the provided cDNA may be used as a hybridization probe against a cDNA library from the target organism of interest, where low stringency conditions are used. The probe may be a large fragment, or one or more short degenerate primers. Nucleic acids having sequence similarity are detected by hybridization under low stringency conditions, for example, at 50\u00b0 C. and 6\u00d7SSC (0.9 M sodium chloride/0.09 M sodium citrate) and remain bound when subjected to washing at 55\u00b0 C. in 1\u00d7SSC (0.15 M sodium chloride/0.015 M sodium citrate). Sequence identity may be determined by hybridization under stringent conditions, for example, at 50\u00b0 C. or higher and 0.1\u00d7SSC (15 mM-sodium chloride/1.5 mM sodium citrate). Nucleic acids having a region of substantial identity to the provided sequences, e.g. allelic variants, genetically altered versions of the gene, etc., bind to the provided sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. By using probes, particularly labeled probes of DNA sequences, one can isolate homologous or related genes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\"> Also of interest are promoter elements of the subject genomic sequences, where the sequence of the 5\u2032 flanking region may be utilized for promoter elements, including enhancer binding sites, e.g., that provide for regulation of expression in cells/tissues where the subject proteins gene are expressed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\"> Also provided are small DNA fragments of the subject nucleic acids, which fragments are useful as primers for PCR, hybridization screening probes, etc. Larger DNA fragments, i.e., greater than 100 nt are useful for production of the encoded polypeptide, as described in the previous section. For use in geometric amplification reactions, such as geometric PCR, a pair of primers will be used. The exact composition of the primer sequences is not critical to the invention, but for most applications the primers will hybridize to the subject sequence under stringent conditions, as known in the art. It is preferable to choose a pair of primers that will generate an amplification product of at least about 50 nt, preferably at least about 100 nt. Algorithms for the selection of primer sequences are generally known, and are available in commercial software packages. Amplification primers hybridize to complementary strands of DNA, and will prime towards each other. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\"> The DNA may also be used to identify expression of the gene in a biological specimen. The manner in which one probes cells for the presence of particular nucleotide sequences, as genomic DNA or RNA, is well established in the literature. Briefly, DNA or mRNA is isolated from a cell sample. The mRNA may be amplified by RT-PCR, using reverse transcriptase to form a complementary DNA strand, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers specific for the subject DNA sequences. Alternatively, the mRNA sample is separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a suitable support, e.g. nitrocellulose, nylon, etc., and then probed with a fragment of the subject DNA as a probe. Other techniques, such as oligonucleotide ligation assays, in situ hybridizations, and hybridization to DNA probes arrayed on a solid chip may also find use. Detection of mRNA hybridizing to the subject sequence is indicative of Anthozoan protein gene expression in the sample. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\"> The subject nucleic acids, including flanking promoter regions and coding regions, may be mutated in various ways known in the art to generate targeted changes in promoter strength, sequence of the encoded protein, properties of the encoded protein, including fluorescent properties of the encoded protein, etc. The DNA sequence or protein product of such a mutation will usually be substantially similar to the sequences provided herein, e.g. will differ by at least one nucleotide or amino acid, respectively, and may differ by at least two but not more than about ten nucleotides or amino acids. The sequence changes may be substitutions, insertions, deletions, or a combination thereof. Deletions may further include larger changes, such as deletions of a domain or exon, e.g. of stretches of 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150 or more aa residues.

In this protocol, the sequence of the candidate protein is aligned with the amino acid sequence of <i>Aequorea victoria </i>wild type GFP, according to the protocol reported in Matz et al., \u201cFluorescent proteins from non-bioluminescent <i>Anthozoa </i>species,\u201d Nature Biotechnology (October 1999) 17: 969-973. Residue 148 of the aligned chromoprotein is identified and then changed to Ser, e.g., by site directed mutagenesis, which results in the production of a fluorescent mutant of the wild type chromoprotein. See e.g., NFP-7 described below, which wild type protein is a chromoprotein that is mutated into a fluorescent protein by substitution of Ser for the native Ala residue at position 148. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\"> Also of interest are humanized versions of the subject nucleic acids.

Mutants may retain biological properties of the wild-type (e.g., naturally occurring) proteins, or may have biological properties which differ from the wild-type proteins. The term \u201cbiological property\u201d of the subject proteins includes, but is not limited to, spectral properties, such as absorbance maximum, emission maximum, maximum extinction coefficient, brightness (e.g., as compared to the wild-type protein or another reference protein such as green fluorescent protein from A.

Several mutants are described herein. Given the guidance provided in the Examples, and using standard techniques, those skilled in the art can readily generate a wide variety of additional mutants and test whether a biological property has been altered. For example, fluorescence intensity can be measured using a spectrophotometer at various excitation wavelengths. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\"> Those proteins of the subject invention that are naturally occurring proteins are present in a non-naturally occurring environment, e.g., are separated from their naturally occurring environment. In certain embodiments, the subject proteins are present in a composition that is enriched for the subject protein as compared to its naturally occurring environment. For example, purified protein is provided, where by purified is meant that the protein is present in a composition that is substantially free of non-chromo/fluoroprotein proteins of interest, where by substantially free is meant that less than 90%, usually less than 60% and more usually less than 50% of the composition is made up of non-chromoproteins or mutants thereof of interest. The proteins of the subject invention may also be present as an isolate, by which is meant that the protein is substantially free of other proteins and other naturally occurring biologic molecules, such as oligosaccharides, polynucleotides and fragments thereof, and the like, where the term \u201csubstantially free\u201d in this instance means that less than 70%, usually less than 60% and more usually less than 50% of the composition containing the isolated protein is some other naturally occurring biological molecule. In certain embodiments, the proteins are present in substantially pure form, where by \u201csubstantially pure form\u201d is meant at least 95%, usually at least 97% and more usually at least 99% pure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\"> In addition to the naturally occurring proteins, polypeptides that vary from the naturally occurring proteins, e.g., the mutant proteins described above, are also provided. Generally such polypeptides include an amino acid sequence encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) of the gene encoding the subject wild type protein, including the full length protein and fragments thereof, particularly biologically active fragments and/or fragments corresponding to functional domains, and the like; and including fusions of the subject polypeptides to other proteins or parts thereof. Fragments of interest will typically be at least about 10 aa in length, usually at least about 50 aa in length, and may be as long as 300 aa in length or longer, but will usually not exceed about 1000 aa in length, where the fragment will have a stretch of amino acids that is identical to the subject protein of at least about 10 aa, and usually at least about 15 aa, and in many embodiments at least about 50 aa in length. In some embodiments, the subject polypeptides are about 25 aa, about 50 aa, about 75 aa, about 100 aa, about 125 aa, about 150 aa, about 200 aa, about 210 aa, about 220 aa, about 230 aa, or about 240 aa in length, up to the entire protein. In some embodiments, a protein fragment retains all or substantially all of a biological property of the wild-type protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\"> The subject proteins and polypeptides may be obtained from naturally occurring sources or synthetically produced. For example, wild type proteins may be derived from biological sources which express the proteins, e.g., non-bioluminescent <i>Cnidarian</i>, e.g., Anthozoan, species, such as the specific ones listed above. The subject proteins may also be derived from synthetic means, e.g., by expressing a recombinant gene or nucleic acid coding sequence encoding the protein of interest in a suitable host, as described above. Any convenient protein purification procedures may be employed, where suitable protein purification methodologies are described in Guide to Protein Purification, (Deuthser ed.) (Academic Press, 1990). For example, a lysate may prepared from the original source and purified using HPLC, exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0025\" num=\"0000\"> Antibody Compositions </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\"> Also provided are antibodies that specifically bind to the subject fluorescent proteins. Suitable antibodies are obtained by immunizing a host animal with peptides comprising all or a portion of the subject protein. Suitable host animals include mouse, rat sheep, goat, hamster, rabbit, etc. The origin of the protein immunogen will generally be a Cnidarian species, specifcally a non-bioluminescent Cnidarian species, such as an Anthozoan species or a non-Petalucean Anthozoan species. The host animal will generally be a different species than the immunogen, e.g., mice, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\"> The immunogen may comprise the complete protein, or fragments and derivatives thereof. Preferred immunogens comprise all or a part of the protein, where these residues contain the post-translation modifications found on the native target protein. Immunogens are produced in a variety of ways known in the art, e.g., expression of cloned genes using conventional recombinant methods, isolation from Anthozoan species of origin, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\"> For preparation of polyclonal antibodies, the first step is immunization of the host animal with the target protein, where the target protein will preferably be in substantially pure form, comprising less than about 1% contaminant. The immunogen may comprise the complete target protein, fragments or derivatives thereof. To increase the immune response of the host animal, the target protein may be combined with an adjuvant, where suitable adjuvants include alum, dextran, sulfate, large polymeric anions, oil &amp; water emulsions, e.g. Freund&#39;s adjuvant, Freund&#39;s complete adjuvant, and the like. The target protein may also be conjugated to synthetic carrier proteins or synthetic antigens. A variety of hosts may be immunized to produce the polyclonal antibodies. Such hosts include rabbits, guinea pigs, rodents, e.g. mice, rats, sheep, goats, and the like. The target protein is administered to the host, usually intradermally, with an initial dosage followed by one or more, usually at least two, additional booster dosages. Following immunization, the blood from the host will be collected, followed by separation of the serum from the blood cells. The Ig present in the resultant antiserum may be further fractionated using known methods, such as ammonium salt fractionation, DEAE chromatography, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\"> Monoclonal antibodies are produced by conventional techniques. Generally, the spleen and/or lymph nodes of an immunized host animal provide a source of plasma cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\"> The plasma cells are immortalized by fusion with myeloma cells to produce hybridoma cells. Culture supernatant from individual hybridomas is screened using standard techniques to identify those producing antibodies with the desired specificity. Suitable animals for production of monoclonal antibodies to the human protein include mouse, rat, hamster, etc. To raise antibodies against the mouse protein, the animal will generally be a hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, etc. The antibody may be purified from the hybridoma cell supernatants or ascites fluid by conventional techniques, e.g. affinity chromatography using protein bound to an insoluble support, protein A sepharose, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0123\"> The antibody may be produced as a single chain, instead of the normal multimeric structure. Single chain antibodies are described in Jost et al. (1994) <i>J.B.C. </i>269:26267-73, and others. DNA sequences encoding the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain are ligated to a spacer encoding at least about 4 amino acids of small neutral amino acids, including glycine and/or serine. The protein encoded by this fusion allows assembly of a functional variable region that retains the specificity and affinity of the original antibody. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0124\"> Also of interest in certain embodiments are humanized antibodies. Methods of humanizing antibodies are known in the art. The humanized antibody may be the product of an animal having transgenic human immunoglobulin constant region genes (see for example International Patent Applications WO 90/10077 and WO 90/04036). Alternatively, the antibody of interest may be engineered by recombinant DNA techniques to substitute the CH1, CH2, CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework domain with the corresponding human sequence (see WO 92/02190). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0125\"> The use of Ig cDNA for construction of chimeric immunoglobulin genes is known in the art (Liu et al. (1987) <i>P.N.A.S. </i>84:3439 and (1987) <i>J. Immunol. </i>139:3521). mRNA is isolated from a hybridoma or other cell producing the antibody and used to produce cDNA. The cDNA of interest may be amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using specific primers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202). Alternatively, a library is made and screened to isolate the sequence of interest. The DNA sequence encoding the variable region of the antibody is then fused to human constant region sequences. The sequences of human constant regions genes may be found in Kabat et al. (1991) <i>Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest</i>, N.I.H. publication no. 91-3242. Human C region genes are readily available from known clones. The choice of isotype will be guided by the desired effector functions, such as complement fixation, or activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Preferred isotypes are IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4. Either of the human light chain constant regions, kappa or lambda, may be used. The chimeric, humanized antibody is then expressed by conventional methods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\"> Antibody fragments, such as Fv, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>and Fab may be prepared by cleavage of the intact protein, e.g. by protease or chemical cleavage. Alternatively, a truncated gene is designed. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a portion of the F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragment would include DNA sequences encoding the CH1 domain and hinge region of the H chain, followed by a translational stop codon to yield the truncated molecule. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\"> Consensus sequences of H and L J regions may be used to design oligonucleotides for use as primers to introduce useful restriction sites into the J region for subsequent linkage of V region segments to human C region segments. C region cDNA can be modified by site directed mutagenesis to place a restriction site at the analogous position in the human sequence. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\"> Expression vectors include plasmids, retroviruses, YACs, EBV derived episomes, and the like. A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human CH or CL immunoglobulin sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any VH or VL sequence can be easily inserted and expressed. In such vectors, splicing usually occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site preceding the human C region, and also at the splice regions that occur within the human CH exons. Polyadenylation and transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites downstream of the coding regions. The resulting chimeric antibody may be joined to any strong promoter, including retroviral LTRs, e.g. SV40 early promoter, (Okayama et al. (1983) <i>Mol. Cell. Bio. </i>3:280), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (Gorman et al. (1982) <i>P.N.A.S. </i>79:6777), and moloney murine leukemia virus LTR (Grosschedl et al. (1985) <i>Cell </i>41:885); native Ig promoters, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0026\" num=\"0000\"> Transgenics </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\"> The subject nucleic acids can be used to generate transgenic, non-human plants or animals or site specific gene modifications in cell lines. Transgenic cells of the subject invention include on or more nucleic acids according to the subject invention present as a transgene, where included within this definition are the parent cells transformed to include the transgene and the progeny thereof. In many embodiments, the transgenic cells are cells that do not normally harbor or contain a nucleic acid according to the subject invention. In those embodiments where the transgenic cells do naturally contain the subject nucleic acids, the nucleic acid will be present in the cell in a position other than its natural location, i.e. integrated into the genomic material of the cell at a non-natural location. Transgenic animals may be made through homologous recombination, where the endogenous locus is altered. Alternatively, a nucleic acid construct is randomly integrated into the genome. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\"> Transgenic organisms of the subject invention include cells and multicellular organisms, e.g., plants and animals, that are endogenous knockouts in which expression of the endogenous gene is at least reduced if not eliminated. Transgenic organisms of interest also include cells and multicellular organisms, e.g., plants and animals, in which the protein or variants thereof is expressed in cells or tissues where it is not normally expressed and/or at levels not normally present in such cells or tissues. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\"> DNA constructs for homologous recombination will comprise at least a portion of the gene of the subject invention, wherein the gene has the desired genetic modification(s), and includes regions of homology to the target locus. DNA constructs for random integration need not include regions of homology to mediate recombination. Conveniently, markers for positive and negative selection are included. Methods for generating cells having targeted gene modifications through homologous recombination are known in the art. For various techniques for transfecting mammalian cells, see Keown et al. (1990), <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>185:527-537. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\"> For embryonic stem (ES) cells, an ES cell line may be employed, or embryonic cells may be obtained freshly from a host, e.g. mouse, rat, guinea pig, etc. Such cells are grown on an appropriate fibroblast-feeder layer or grown in the presence of leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF). When ES or embryonic cells have been transformed, they may be used to produce transgenic animals. After transformation, the cells are plated onto a feeder layer in an appropriate medium. Cells containing the construct may be detected by employing a selective medium. After sufficient time for colonies to grow, they are picked and analyzed for the occurrence of homologous recombination or integration of the construct. Those colonies that are positive may then be used for embryo manipulation and blastocyst injection. Blastocysts are obtained from 4 to 6 week old superovulated females. The ES cells are trypsinized, and the modified cells are injected into the blastocoel of the blastocyst. After injection, the blastocysts are returned to each uterine horn of pseudopregnant females. Females are then allowed to go to term and the resulting offspring screened for the construct. By providing for a different phenotype of the blastocyst and the genetically modified cells, chimeric progeny can be readily detected. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\"> The chimeric animals are screened for the presence of the modified gene and males and females having the modification are mated to produce homozygous progeny. If the gene alterations cause lethality at some point in development, tissues or organs can be maintained as allogeneic or congenic grafts or transplants, or in in vitro culture. The transgenic animals may be any non-human mammal, such as laboratory animals, domestic animals, etc. The transgenic animals may be used in functional studies, drug screening, etc. Representative examples of the use of transgenic animals include those described infra. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\"> Transgenic plants may be produced in a similar manner. Methods of preparing transgenic plant cells and plants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,767,367; 5,750,870; 5,739,409; 5,689,049; 5,689,045; 5,674,731; 5,656,466; 5,633,155; 5,629,470; 5,595,896; 5,576,198; 5,538,879; 5,484,956; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Methods of producing transgenic plants are also reviewed in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (eds Lea &amp; Leegood, John Wiley &amp; Sons)(1993) pp 275-295. In brief, a suitable plant cell or tissue is harvested, depending on the nature of the plant species. As such, in certain instances, protoplasts will be isolated, where such protoplasts may be isolated from a variety of different plant tissues, e.g. leaf, hypoctyl, root, etc. For protoplast isolation, the harvested cells are incubated in the presence of cellulases in order to remove the cell wall, where the exact incubation conditions vary depending on the type of plant and/or tissue from which the cell is derived. The resultant protoplasts are then separated from the resultant cellular debris by sieving and centrifugation. Instead of using protoplasts, embryogenic explants comprising somatic cells may be used for preparation of the transgenic host. Following cell or tissue harvesting, exogenous DNA of interest is introduced into the plant cells, where a variety of different techniques are available for such introduction. With isolated protoplasts, the opportunity arise for introduction via DNA-mediated gene transfer protocols, including: incubation of the protoplasts with naked DNA, e.g. plasmids, comprising the exogenous coding sequence of interest in the presence of polyvalent cations, e.g. PEG or PLO; and electroporation of the protoplasts in the presence of naked DNA comprising the exogenous sequence of interest. Protoplasts that have successfully taken up the exogenous DNA are then selected, grown into a callus, and ultimately into a transgenic plant through contact with the appropriate amounts and ratios of stimulatory factors, e.g. auxins and cytokinins. With embryogenic explants, a convenient method of introducing the exogenous DNA in the target somatic cells is through the use of particle acceleration or \u201cgene-gun\u201d protocols. The resultant explants are then allowed to grow into chimera plants, cross-bred and transgenic progeny are obtained. Instead of the naked DNA approaches described above, another convenient method of producing transgenic plants is <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation. With <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation, co-integrative or binary vectors comprising the exogenous DNA are prepared and then introduced into an appropriate <i>Agrobacterium </i>strain, e.g. <i>A. tumefaciens</i>. The resultant bacteria are then incubated with prepared protoplasts or tissue explants, e.g. leaf disks, and a callus is produced. The callus is then grown under selective conditions, selected and subjected to growth media to induce root and shoot growth to ultimately produce a transgenic plant. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0027\" num=\"0000\"> Utility </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\"> The subject chromoproteins and fluorescent mutants thereof find use in a variety of different applications, where the applications necessarily differ depending on whether the protein is a chromoprotein or a fluorescent protein. Representative uses for each of these types of proteins will be described below, where the follow described uses are merely representative and are in no way meant to limit the use of the subject proteins to those described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0028\" num=\"0000\"> Chromoproteins </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0136\"> The subject chromoproteins of the present invention find use in a variety of different applications. One application of interest is the use of the subject proteins as coloring agents which are capable of imparting color or pigment to a particular composition of matter. Of particular interest in certain embodiments are non-toxic chromoproteins. The subject chromoproteins may be incorporated into a variety of different compositions of matter, where representative compositions of matter include: food compositions, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, living organisms, e.g., animals and plants, and the like. Where used as a coloring agent or pigment, a sufficient amount of the chromoprotein is incorporated into the composition of matter to impart the desired color or pigment thereto. The chromoprotein may be incorporated into the composition of matter using any convenient protocol, where the particular protocol employed will necessarily depend, at least in part, on the nature of the composition of matter to be colored. Protocols that may be employed include, but are not limited to: blending, diffusion, friction, spraying, injection, tattooing, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\"> The chromoproteins may also find use as labels in analyte detection assays, e.g., assays for biological analytes of interest. For example, the chromoproteins may be incorporated into adducts with analyte specific antibodies or binding fragments thereof and subsequently employed in immunoassays for analytes of interest in a complex sample, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,536; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Instead of antibodies or binding fragments thereof, the subject chromoproteins or chromogenic fragments thereof may be conjugated to ligands that specifically bind to an analyte of interest, or other moieties, growth factors, hormones, and the like; as is readily apparent to those of skill in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0138\"> In yet other embodiments, the subject chromoproteins may be used as selectable markers in recombinant DNA applications, e.g., the production of transgenic cells and organisms, as described above. As such, one can engineer a particular transgenic production protocol to employ expression of the subject chromoproteins as a selectable marker, either for a successful or unsuccessful protocol. Thus, appearance of the color of the subject chromoprotein in the phenotype of the transgenic organism produced by a particular process can be used to indicate that the particular organism successfully harbors the transgene of interest, often integrated in a manner that provides for expression of the transgene in the organism. When used a selectable marker, a nucleic acid encoding for the subject chromoprotein can be employed in the transgenic generation process, where this process is described in greater detail supra. Particular transgenic organisms of interest where the subject proteins may be employed as selectable markers include transgenic plants, animals, bacteria, fungi, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0139\"> In yet other embodiments, the chromoproteins (and fluorescent proteins) of the subject invention find use in sunscreens, as selective filters, etc., in a manner similar to the uses of the proteins described in WO 00/46233. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0029\" num=\"0000\"> Fluorescent Proteins </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0140\"> The subject fluorescent proteins of the present invention (as well as other components of the subject invention described above) find use in a variety of different applications, where such applications include, but are not limited to, the following. The first application of interest is the use of the subject proteins in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications. In these applications, the subject proteins serve as donor and/or acceptors in combination with a second fluorescent protein or dye, e.g., a fluorescent protein as described in Matz et al., Nature Biotechnology (October 1999) 17:969-973, a green fluorescent protein from <i>Aequora victoria </i>or fluorescent mutant thereof, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,066,476; 6,020,192; 5,985,577; 5,976,796; 5,968,750; 5,968,738; 5,958,713; 5,919,445; 5,874,304, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference, other fluorescent dyes, e.g., coumarin and its derivatives, e.g. 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, aminocoumarin, bodipy dyes, such as Bodipy FL, cascade blue, fluorescein and its derivatives, e.g. fluorescein isothiocyanate, Oregon green, rhodamine dyes, e.g. texas red, tetramethylrhodamine, eosins and erythrosins, cyanine dyes, e.g. Cy3 and Cy5, macrocyclic chelates of lanthanide ions, e.g. quantum dye, etc., chemilumescent dyes, e.g., luciferases, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,746; 5,700,673; 5,674,713; 5,618,722; 5,418,155; 5,330,906; 5,229,285; 5,221,623; 5,182,202; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. Specific examples of where FRET assays employing the subject fluorescent proteins may be used include, but are not limited to: the detection of protein-protein interactions, e.g., mammalian two-hybrid system, transcription factor dimerization, membrane protein multimerization, multiprotein complex formation, etc., as a biosensor for a number of different events, where a peptide or protein covalently links a FRET fluorescent combination including the subject fluorescent proteins and the linking peptide or protein is, e.g., a protease specific substrate, e.g., for caspase mediated cleavage, a linker that undergoes conformational change upon receiving a signal which increases or decreases FRET, e.g., PKA regulatory domain (cAMP-sensor), phosphorylation, e.g., where there is a phosphorylation site in the linker or the linker has binding specificity to phosphorylated/dephosphorylated domain of another protein, or the linker has Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain. Representative fluorescence resonance energy transfer or FRET applications in which the subject proteins find use include, but are not limited to, those described in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,008,373; 5,998,146; 5,981,200; 5,945,526; 5,945,283; 5,911,952; 5,869,255; 5,866,336; 5,863,727; 5,728,528; 5,707,804; 5,688,648; 5,439,797; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0141\"> The subject fluorescent proteins also find use as biosensors in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, e.g. as Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion indicator; as pH indicator, as phorphorylation indicator, as an indicator of other ions, e.g., magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride and halides. For example, for detection of Ca ion, proteins containing an EF-hand motif are known to translocate from the cytosol to membranes upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding. These proteins contain a myristoyl group that is buried within the molecule by hydrophobic interactions with other regions of the protein. Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a conformational change exposing the myristoyl group which then is available for the insertion into the lipid bilayer (called a \u201cCa<sup>2+</sup>-myristoyl switch\u201d). Fusion of such a EF-hand containing protein to Fluorescent Proteins (FP) could make it an indicator of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by monitoring the translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy. EF-hand proteins suitable for use in this system include, but are not limited to: recoverin (1-3), calcineurin B, troponin C, visinin, neurocalcin, calmodulin, parvalbumin, and the like. For pH, a system based on hisactophilins may be employed. Hisactophilins are myristoylated histidine-rich proteins known to exist in Dictyostelium. Their binding to actin and acidic lipids is sharply pH-dependent within the range of cytoplasmic pH variations. In living cells membrane binding seems to override the interaction of hisactophilins with actin filaments. At pH 6.5 they locate to the plasma membrane and nucleus. In contrast, at pH 7.5 they evenly distribute throughout the cytoplasmic space. This change of distribution is reversible and is attributed to histidine clusters exposed in loops on the surface of the molecule. The reversion of intracellular distribution in the range of cytoplasmic pH variations is in accord with a pK of 6.5 of histidine residues. The cellular distribution is independent of myristoylation of the protein. By fusing FPs (Fluoresent Proteins) to hisactophilin the intracellular distribution of the fusion protein can be followed by laser scanning, confocal microscopy or standard fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative fluorescence analysis can be done by performing line scans through cells (laser scanning confocal microscopy) or other electronic data analysis (e.g., using metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp) and averaging of data collected in a population of cells. Substantial pH-dependent redistribution of hisactophilin-FP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane occurs within 1-2 min and reaches a steady state level after 5-10 min. The reverse reaction takes place on a similar time scale. As such, hisactophilin-fluorescent protein fusion protein that acts in an analogous fashion can be used to monitor cytosolic pH changes in real time in live mammalian cells. Such methods have use in high throughput applications, e.g., in the measurement of pH changes as consequence of growth factor receptor activation (e.g. epithelial or platelet-derived growth factor) chemotactic stimulation/cell locomotion, in the detection of intracellular pH changes as second messenger, in the monitoring of intracellular pH in pH manipulating experiments, and the like. For detection of PKC activity, the reporter system exploits the fact that a molecule called MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) is a PKC substrate. It is anchored to the plasma membrane via myristoylation and a stretch of positively charged amino acids (ED-domain) that bind to the negatively charged plasma membrane via electrostatic interactions. Upon PKC activation the ED-domain becomes phosphorylated by PKC, thereby becoming negatively charged, and as a consequence of electrostatic repulsion MARCKS translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (called the \u201cmyristoyl-electrostatic switch\u201d). Fusion of the N-terminus of MARCKS ranging from the myristoylation motif to the ED-domain of MARCKS to fluorescent proteins of the present invention makes the above a detector system for PKC activity. When phosphorylated by PKC, the fusion protein translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This translocation is followed by standard fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy e.g. using the Cellomics technology or other High Content Screening systems (e.g. Universal Imaging Corp./Becton Dickinson). The above reporter system has application in High Content Screening, e.g., screening for PKC inhibitors, and as an indicator for PKC activity in many screening scenarios for potential reagents interfering with this signal transduction pathway. Methods of using fluorescent proteins as biosensors also include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 972,638; 5,824,485 and 5,650,135 (as well as the references cited therein) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0142\"> The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in applications involving the automated screening of arrays of cells expressing fluorescent reporting groups by using microscopic imaging and electronic analysis. Screening can be used for drug discovery and in the field of functional genomics: e.g., where the subject proteins are used as markers of whole cells to detect changes in multicellular reorganization and migration, e.g., formation of multicellular tubules (blood vessel formation) by endothelial cells, migration of cells through Fluoroblok Insert System (Becton Dickinson Co.), wound healing, neurite outgrowth, etc.; where the proteins are used as markers fused to peptides (e.g., targeting sequences) and proteins that allow the detection of change of intracellular location as indicator for cellular activity, for example: signal transduction, such as kinase and transcription factor translocation upon stimuli, such as protein kinase C, protein kinase A, transcription factor NFkB, and NFAT; cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin A, cyclin B1 and cyclinE; protease cleavage with subsequent movement of cleaved substrate, phospholipids, with markers for intracellular structures such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, nucleus, nucleoli, plasma membrane, histones, endosomes, lysosomes, microtubules, actin) as tools for High Content Screening: co-localization of other fluorescent fusion proteins with these localization markers as indicators of movements of intracellular fluorescent fusion proteins/peptides or as marker alone; and the like. Examples of applications involving the automated screening of arrays of cells in which the subject fluorescent proteins find use include: U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,835; as well as WO/0017624; WO 00/26408; WO 00/17643; and WO 00/03246; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0143\"> The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in high through-put screening assays. The subject fluorescent proteins are stable proteins with half-lives of more than 24 h. Also provided are destabilized versions of the subject fluorescent proteins with shorter half-lives that can be used as transcription reporters for drug discovery. For example, a protein according to the subject invention can be fused with a putative proteolytic signal sequence derived from a protein with shorter half-life, e.g., PEST sequence from the mouse ornithine decarboxylase gene, mouse cyclin B1 destruction box and ubiquitin, etc. For a description of destabilized proteins and vectors that can be employed to produce the same, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,313; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Promoters in signal transduction pathways can be detected using destabilized versions of the subject fluorescent proteins for drug screening, e.g., AP1, NFAT, NFkB, Smad, STAT, p53, E2F, Rb, myc, CRE, ER, GR and TRE, and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0144\"> The subject proteins can be used as second messenger detectors, e.g., by fusing the subject proteins to specific domains: e.g., PKCgamma Ca binding domain, PKCgamma DAG binding domain, SH2 domain and SH3 domain, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0145\"> Secreted forms of the subject proteins can be prepared, e.g. by fusing secreted leading sequences to the subject proteins to construct secreted forms of the subject proteins, which in turn can be used in a variety of different applications. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0146\"> The subject proteins also find use in fluorescence activated cell sorting applications. In such applications, the subject fluorescent protein is used as a label to mark a population of cells and the resulting labeled population of cells is then sorted with a fluorescent activated cell sorting device, as is known in the art. FACS methods are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,968,738 and 5,804,387; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0148\" num=\"0147\"> The subject proteins also find use as in vivo marker in animals (e.g., transgenic animals). For example, expression of the subject protein can be driven by tissue specific promoters, where such methods find use in research for gene therapy, e.g., testing efficiency of transgenic expression, among other applications. A representative application of fluorescent proteins in transgenic animals that illustrates this class of applications of the subject proteins is found in WO 00/02997, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0148\"> Additional applications of the subject proteins include: as markers following injection into cells or animals and in calibration for quantitative measurements (fluorescence and protein); as markers or reporters in oxygen biosensor devices for monitoring cell viability; as markers or labels for animals, pets, toys, food, etc.; and the like. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0149\"> The subject fluorescent proteins also find use in protease cleavage assays. For example, cleavage inactivated fluorescence assays can be developed using the subject proteins, where the subject proteins are engineered to include a protease specific cleavage sequence without destroying the fluorescent character of the protein. Upon cleavage of the fluorescent protein by an activated protease fluorescence would sharply decrease due to the destruction of a functional chromophor. Alternatively, cleavage activated fluorescence can be developed using the subject proteins, where the subject proteins are engineered to contain an additional spacer sequence in close proximity/or inside the chromophor. This variant would be significantly decreased in its fluorescent activity, because parts of the functional chromophor would be divided by the spacer. The spacer would be framed by two identical protease specific cleavage sites. Upon cleavage via the activated protease the spacer would be cut out and the two residual \u201csubunits\u201d of the fluorescent protein would be able to reassemble to generate a functional fluorescent protein. Both of the above types of application could be developed in assays for a variety of different types of proteases, e.g., caspases, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0150\"> The subject proteins can also be used is assays to determine the phospholipid composition in biological membranes. For example, fusion proteins of the subject proteins (or any other kind of covalent or non-covalent modification of the subject proteins) that allows binding to specific phospholipids to localize/visualize patterns of phospholipid distribution in biological membranes also allowing colocalization of membrane proteins in specific phospholipid rafts can be accomplished with the subject proteins. For example, the PH domain of GRP1 has a high affinity to phosphatidyl-inositol tri-phosphate (PIP3) but not to PIP2. As such, a fusion protein between the PH domain of GRP1 and the subject proteins can be constructed to specifically label PIP3 rich areas in biological membranes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0151\"> Yet another application of the subject proteins is as a fluorescent timer, in which the switch of one fluorescent color to another (e.g. green to red) concomitant with the ageing of the fluorescent protein is used to determine the activation/deactivation of gene expression, e.g., developmental gene expression, cell cycle dependent gene expression, circadian rhythm specific gene expression, and the like </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0152\"> The antibodies of the subject invention, described above, also find use in a number of applications, including the differentiation of the subject proteins from other fluorescent proteins. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0030\" num=\"0000\"> Kits </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0153\"> Also provided by the subject invention are kits for use in practicing one or more of the above described applications, where the subject kits typically include elements for making the subject proteins, e.g., a construct comprising a vector that includes a coding region for the subject protein. The subject kit components are typically present in a suitable storage medium, e.g., buffered solution, typically in a suitable container. Also present in the subject kits may be antibodies to the provided protein. In certain embodiments, the kit comprises a plurality of different vectors each encoding the subject protein, where the vectors are designed for expression in different environments and/or under different conditions, e.g., constitutive expression where the vector includes a strong promoter for expression in mammalian cells, a promoterless vector with a multiple cloning site for custom insertion of a promoter and tailored expression, etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0154\"> In addition to the above components, the subject kits will further include instructions for practicing the subject methods. These instructions may be present in the subject kits in a variety of forms, one or more of which may be present in the kit. One form in which these instructions may be present is as printed information on a suitable medium or substrate, e.g., a piece or pieces of paper on which the information is printed, in the packaging of the kit, in a package insert, etc. Yet another means would be a computer readable medium, e.g., diskette, CD, etc., on which the information has been recorded.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0159\"> Mut32 DNA was amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone with BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sites. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, Calif.). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0160\"> Functional tests of the generated vectors were performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, brighter fluorescent intensity and less photobleaching of pCNFPMut32-N1 were observed by microscopy when compared with pECFP-N1 side by side. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0161\"> Mut32 has fast folding and bright fluorescent intensity, which makes it useful for number of applications. Some fusion proteins were tested, such as PKC-gamma-CNFP. PKC was observed to translocate from cytosol to the plasma membrane when cells were treated with PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate). </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0033\" num=\"0000\"> C. Generation of Destabilized amFP486 Vectors as Transcription Reporters </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0162\"> Three destabilized amFP486 vectors were constructed by fusing different mouse ODC degradation domains such as d1, d2 and d376 to the C-terminal of wild type amFP486 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,600; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. The vectors were constructed in the EGFP-N1 backbone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0163\"> Vectors of pCRE-d1CNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1CNFP were constructed by placing d1CNFP downstream of cAMP response element (CRE) or NF-\u03baB response element, respectively. Expression of d1CNFP is up-regulated upon activation of these response elements. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0034\" num=\"0000\"> D. Functional Analysis of Destabilized amFP486 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0164\"> Functional tests of the destabilized amFP486 were performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, the fluorescent intensity was decreased gradually from d2, d1 and d376 because of the fusion with different mouse ODC degradation domains. After 4-hour treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, d2 fluorescent intensity did not change very much; however, d1 fluorescent intensity decreased further 50% of its original intensity. The half-life of d1 is around 4 hours. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0165\"> MODCd1 is a valuable tool for application as a transcription reporter. However, compared with EGFP-d1 (1-hour half-life), pCNFP-MODCd1 half-life (4 hours) is still long, so further mutagenesis for MODC degradation domain is still needed for shorter half-life version. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0166\"> Functional tests of vectors pCRE-d1CNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1CNFP were performed by transient transfection in HEK 293 cells. 16 hours post transfection, 10 \u03bcm forskolin was added to induce CRE and 100 ng/ml TNF-alpha was added to induce NF-\u03baB for 6 hours. Expression of d1CNFP was analyzed using FACS Calibur. Up to 7 fold increase of fluorescence in forskolin induced CRE activation and 4 fold increase of fluorescence in TNF-\u03b1 induced NF-KB activation was observed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0035\" num=\"0000\"> E. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized Mut32 (phCNFP-N1) </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0167\"> Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, a human favored codon version of this mutant is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. To generate humanized Mut32, the Mut 32 sequence was first changed to human favored codon and 23 oligos (12F and 11R) were designed. Next, four rounds of PCR amplification were performed, each round for 20 cycles. PCR cycle was designed as follows: 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min; 94\u00b0 C. for 1 min; 40\u00b0 C. for 1 min; and 72\u00b0 C. for 1 min. The four rounds were: for 1<sup>st </sup>round, mixing 2 \u03bcl each of every 4 oligos (60 bp), 5 \u03bcl buffer, 1 \u03bcl pfu, 1 \u03bcl dNTP to make total volume of 50 \u03bcl. After 20 cycles of PCR, 5 sets of 150 bp and 1 set of 4 last oligos of 90 bp products were obtained. For 2<sup>nd </sup>round, mixing new crude PCR products 10 \u03bcl each, 5 \u03bcl buffer, 1 \u03bcl pfu, 1 \u03bcl dNTP to make total volume of 50 \u03bcl. After 20 cycles of PCR, 2 sets of 270 bp and 1set of 210 bp PCR products were obtained. For 3<sup>rd </sup>round, mixing new crude PCR products. After 20 cycles of PCR, 1 set of 510 bp and 1 set of 450 bp products were obtained. For 4<sup>th </sup>round, mixing new crude products. After 20 cycles of PCR, final PCR product (690 bp) was obtained. Further PCR amplification was performed using 1F and 11R primers. As a result, humanized Mut32 was generated. This humanized Mut32 was constituted into EGFP-N1 backbone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0036\" num=\"0000\"> F. Expression of Wildtype and Mutant amFP486 in Mammalian Cells </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0168\"> The original plasmid amFP486 DNAs (wildtype, Mut15 and Mut32 in pQE30) were used to construct N1 version of amFP486 wildtype, Mut-15 and Mut32 as described above. The DNAs were inserted into <i>E. coli </i>DH5a. HEK 293 cells were transferred with each of the three N1 constructs using Calcium Phosphate method (Clontech product #K2051-1). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0169\"> The fluorescent intensity of the transfected cells was analyzed on FACS using FL1 (510/30) detecting channel. Five samples were analyzed in parallel for each construct. The observed mean value of FL1 fluorescent intensity of the M1 population of each sample is summarized in Table 3. It shows that the average of the mean value of each construct (Wildtype, Mut15, and Mut32) has no significant difference.  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00003\" num=\"3\"> <patent-tables frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"1\"> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"217PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <patent-thead> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\">TABLE 3</entry> </row> </patent-thead>  <row> <entry> </entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> <row> <entry>FL1 Fluorescent Intensity of M1 Population</entry> </row>  </tgroup> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"5\"> <colspec colname=\"OFFSET\" colwidth=\"14PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"70PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"35PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec>  <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>Sample #</entry> <entry>Wildtype</entry> <entry>Mut15</entry> <entry>Mut32</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry namest=\"OFFSET\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row>  </tgroup> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"5\"> <colspec colname=\"OFFSET\" colwidth=\"14PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"70PT\" align=\"char\" char=\".\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"35PT\" align=\"char\" char=\".\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"char\" char=\".\"> </colspec>  <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>1</entry> <entry>82.84</entry> <entry>106.95</entry> <entry>84.51</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>2</entry> <entry>77.52</entry> <entry>108.73</entry> <entry>91.41</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>3</entry> <entry>111.85</entry> <entry>97.08</entry> <entry>91.30</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>4</entry> <entry>113.06</entry> <entry>90.16</entry> <entry>98.16</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>5</entry> <entry>104.95</entry> <entry>86.34</entry> <entry>111.44</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>Mean</entry> <entry>98.04</entry> <entry>97.85</entry> <entry>95.36</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry namest=\"OFFSET\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row>  </tgroup> </patent-tables> </tables>\\n<br/>\\n G. Generation and Expression of Fusion Protein Mut15-mdm2 \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0170\"> The Mut15-mdm2 fusion was generated by the following steps: first, mdm2 DNA was obtained by amplifying human Marathon cDNA library (Burke&#39;s Lymphoma) using primers: ATGTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC (SEQ ID No.19) and CTAGGGGAAATAAGTTAGCAC (SEQ ID No. 20); secondly, the purified PCR product was then amplified with primers: GGGAATTCCAGCCATGGTGTGCAATACCAACATGTCTGTACC (SEQ ID No. 21) and TCCCCCGGGGGGAAATAAGTTAGCAC (SEQ ID No. 22) in order to add Kozac sequence and restriction sites; thirdly, the purified PCR product from step 2 was digested with EcoR I and Sma I and inserted into EcoR I and SmaI of NFP1Mut15-N1 vector (this vector was generated using BamH I and Not I sites of the pEGFP-N1 backbone). The generated Mut15-mdm2 fusion was then expressed in HEK293cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0037\" num=\"0000\"> H. Comparison of the Protein Fluorescent Intensity </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0171\"> PQE30 amFP486 wildtype, Mut15 and Mut32 were transformed into DH5\u03b1. The bacteria grew in the presence of 1 mM IPTG overnight to induce the protein expression. Cells were lysed in 100 mM Tris, pH8.0 by sonication. Cell lysate was collected after centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. The proteins were purified with TALON\u2122 Meta Affinity Resin (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.). Briefly, after the protein was absorbed on the resin, the beads were washed in stepwise with first wash, then first elution (50 mM imidazole) and second elution (200 mM imidazole) in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein is found mostly in the second step elution. It was found that Mut32 has the highest bacterial expression level, while Mut15 has the lowest. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0172\"> Samples of each elution fraction were run on SDS-PAGE to check the purity of the proteins. Both wildtype amFP486 and Mut32 show a single band, while Mut5 has two more minor bands with higher molecular weight (data not shown). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0173\"> The protein concentration (fractionII-2) was checked and measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad standard assay) using BSA as a standard. The fluorescence intensity (fraction II-2) was determined with a LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer LS50B. EX=458 nm, EM=492 nm, both slits=2.5 nm. Table 4 shows the protein concentration, relative fluorescent (FL) intensity and intensity/\u03bcg protein in 700 \u03bcl volume. It shows that Mut32 is as bright as wildtype, while Mut15 is worse than the wildtype.  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00004\" num=\"4\"> <patent-tables frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"4\"> <colspec colname=\"OFFSET\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"49PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <patent-thead> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry namest=\"OFFSET\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\">TABLE 4</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry> </entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry namest=\"OFFSET\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry> </entry> <entry> </entry> <entry>Intensity/\u03bcg</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>Protein</entry> <entry>Relative FL</entry> <entry>Protein in 700</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>Concentration</entry> <entry>Intensity</entry> <entry>\u03bcl Volume</entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry namest=\"OFFSET\" nameend=\"3\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> </patent-thead>  <row> <entry> </entry> </row>  </tgroup> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"4\"> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"56PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"49PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec>  <row> <entry>Wildtype II-2</entry> <entry>1.26 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl</entry> <entry>37.805/5 \u03bcl</entry> <entry>30.00</entry> </row> <row> <entry>Mut15II-2</entry> <entry>0.64 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl</entry> <entry>10.152/5 \u03bcl</entry> <entry>15.86</entry> </row> <row> <entry>Mut32II-2</entry> <entry>6.17 \u03bcg/5 \u03bcl</entry> <entry>186.474/5 \u03bcl\\u2002</entry> <entry>30.22</entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row>  </tgroup> </patent-tables> </tables>\\n<br/>\\n III.

Compared with wild type zFP506, N66M has the mutation of from \u201cAAC\u201d to \u201cATG\u201d which results in the corresponding amino acid change from Asparagine (N) to Methionine (M) at the position of 66. The spectral properties of N66M are listed in Table 5.  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00005\" num=\"5\"> <patent-tables frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" pgwide=\"1\"> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"1\"> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"259PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <patent-thead> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\">TABLE 5</entry> </row> </patent-thead>  <row> <entry> </entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> <row> <entry>Spectral Properties of the Isolated N66M</entry> </row>  </tgroup> <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"7\"> <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"28PT\" align=\"left\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"42PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"35PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"5\" colwidth=\"35PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"6\" colwidth=\"35PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec> <colspec colname=\"7\" colwidth=\"42PT\" align=\"center\"> </colspec>  <row> <entry> </entry> <entry> </entry> <entry>Absorbance</entry> <entry>Emission</entry> <entry>Maximum</entry> <entry> </entry> <entry> </entry> </row> <row> <entry> </entry> <entry>NFP</entry> <entry>Maximum</entry> <entry>Maximum</entry> <entry>Extinction</entry> <entry>Quantum</entry> <entry>Relative</entry> </row> <row> <entry>Species</entry> <entry>Name</entry> <entry>Nm</entry> <entry>nm</entry> <entry>Coeff.</entry> <entry>Yield</entry> <entry>Brightness*</entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> <row> <entry> <i>Zoanthus </i>sp.</entry> <entry>N65M</entry> <entry>496</entry> <entry>506</entry> <entry>62,000</entry> <entry>0.63</entry> <entry>1.78</entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry> </row> <row> <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"7\" align=\"left\" id=\"FOO-00004\"> <br/>*relative brightness is extinction coefficient multiplied by quantum yield divided by the same value for <i>A. victoria </i>GFP. <br/> </entry> </row>  </tgroup> </patent-tables> </tables>\\n<br/>\\n B. Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0177\"> Non-humanized zFP506 DNA was amplified via PCR and reconstructed into EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Functional test of the generated vector was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of zFP506 was examined under fluorescent microscope. zFP506 showed good fluorescent intensity and comparable to EGFP-N1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0041\" num=\"0000\"> C. Generation of Destabilized zFP506 Vectors as Transcription Reporters </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0178\"> Since zFP506 is very stable, it is necessary to generate destabilized versions of zFP506 in order to observe the rapid turnover of the protein. By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, two destabilized zFP506 vectors were constructed by fusing mouse ODC degradation domain to the C-terminal of zFP506. The d1 version of destabilized zFP506 has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain comparing to d2 version, therefore result in a shorter half-life of the protein to which MODC degradation domain fused to. Destabilized d1zFP506 and d2zFP506 were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0042\" num=\"0000\"> D. Functional Analysis of Destabilized zFP506 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0179\"> Wildtype d1zFP506 was transiently transfected into 293 cells. 24 hours after transfection, CHX was added to stop protein synthesis. After 4 hour treatment, cells were examined under fluorescent microscope. It shows that fusion of MODC domain to the zFP506 slightly decreases the fluorescent intensity compared to zFP506 itself. After 4 hour treatment, there is 50% fluorescent intensity decrease. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0043\" num=\"0000\"> E. Application of Destabilized d1zFP506 as Transcription Reporters </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0180\"> Destabilized d1zFP506 was constructed into pCRE-d1GNFP and pNF-\u03baB-d1GNFP vectors. Its expression was regulated under cAMP response element (CRE) or NF-\u03baB response element, respectively. These vectors were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and 24 hours post transfection, the expression of d1GNFP was induced by Forskolin or TNF-\u03b1. 6 hours after induction, the culture was analysed by FACS. CRE-d1GNFP showed 7 fold of induction in fluorescence intensity, while 4 fold of induction was obtained in NF-\u03baB-d1GNFP (data not shown). This demonstrated that the destabilized form of GNFP is applicable as transcription reporters. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0044\" num=\"0000\"> F. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized zFP506 and Humanized N66M </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0181\"> Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, human favored codon version is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. Each piece of human favored codon oligos was linked to form the full length of wild type and/or mutant zFP506 (hGNFP-zFP506; hGNFP-N65M. This humanized zFP506 was constituted into EGFP-N1 backbone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0045\" num=\"0000\"> V. Characterization of zFPD-38 and mutants thereof (NFP4; ZsYellow) </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\"> A mutant of zFP538 M129V (as measured from the start of the protein) was generated. M129V (M128V using GFP numbering) was generated by introducing a wrong nucleotide in PCR during site-specific mutagenesis at position 65. One bright yellow colony was obtained, and the sequence of this clone was performed. It showed that this clone contained wild type amino acid Lysine (K) at position 65, but had a substitution from Methionine (M) to Valine (V) at position 129 (numbering from start of protein; at position 128 if numbering according to GFP homology alignment). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\"> Further investigations showed that M129V has spectral characteristics very similar to wild type protein zFP538 but folds much faster.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\"> Both wildtype (wt) and mutant zFP538 DNA were amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Both pYNFPwt and pYNFPW129V keep the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. Functional test of the generated vectors was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, pYNFPwt, pYNFPM129V and EYFP were compared side by side: pYNFPwt showed less fluorescent intensity than EYFP (data not shown); however, pYNFPM129V showed as bright fluorescent intensity as EYFP by fluorescent microscopy. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0046\" num=\"0000\"> B. Generation of Destabilized zFP538 Vectors as Transcription Reporters </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\"> By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, destabilized zFP538 vectors were constructed by fusing different mouse ODC degradation domains such as d1 and d2 to the C-terminal of zFP538. The d1 version of destabilized YNFP has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain compared to d2 version. Vectors pYNFPM128V-MODCd1 and pYNFPM128V-MODCd2 were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0047\" num=\"0000\"> C. Functional Analysis of Destabilized zFP538 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\"> Functional test of the destabilized zFP538 was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. After 24-hour expression, the fluorescent intensity was decreased gradually from d2 and d1 because of the fusion with different mouse ODC degradation domains. After 4-hour treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, d2 fluorescent intensity did not change very much; however, d1 fluorescent intensity decreased further 50% of its original intensity. The half-life of d1 is around 4 hours. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\"> M129V has fast folding and bright fluorescent intensity, which makes it useful for number of applications. Some fusion proteins were tested such as PKC-gamma-YNFP (M129V). PKC-gamma was observed to translocate from cytosol to the plasma membrane when cells were treated with PMA (Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate). </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0048\" num=\"0000\"> D. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized M129V </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\"> Humanized M129V was generated, and then placed into the pEGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as pEGFP-N1. Construction of C1 and pEGFP is in the process. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0049\" num=\"0000\"> E. Structural Characterization of Green Mutant </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0050\" num=\"0000\"> 1. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0189\"> Data show zFP538 is non-dissociating trimer of 80 kD/dimer-tetramer equilibrium with S values of about 6 and 8; results not conclusive, but sure that there is more than one species. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0051\" num=\"0000\"> 2. Structure: </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0190\"> Tetramer, extremely similar to DsRed; no idea why wildtype is yellow, chromophore is identical to that of GFP; although the tetramers of dsRed and zFP538 are essentially identical in the overall configuration and in the positioning of the interfacial regions, the residues involved in interfacial contacts are not conserved. This finding indicates that a lot of variability is tolerated and monomers can be created. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0052\" num=\"0000\"> VI. Characterization of dsFP483 and Mutants Thereof (NFP-5) </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0053\" num=\"0000\"> Mutants of NFP-5 include (according to GFP numbering): N68S; I112S; and N68S/I112S. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0054\" num=\"0000\"> VII. Characterization of drFP583 and Mutants Thereof (NFP-6; DsRed; DsRed2) </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0055\" num=\"0000\"> A. Expression in Mammalian Cells </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0191\"> HeLa cells were transfected either with plasmid pDsRed1-N1 (vector containing the DNA encoding drFP583) or plasmid pEGFP-C1 (encoding EGFP from <i>Aequorea victoria</i>). Immediately after the transfection, cells were mixed and plated on coverslips. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were mounted in mounting medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken from the same field of view with Chroma filter set 31001 for EGFP and filter set 31002 for drFP583 using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). The images were pseudocolored and overlayed. Phase contrast was taken from the same field of view and overlayed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0056\" num=\"0000\"> B. Generation of Humanized drFP583 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0192\"> Since mammalian expression is a very popular tool, human favored codon version is needed for better expression in mammalian cells. Humanized drFP583 was therefore generated by changing wild type drFP583 nucleotide sequence to optimize the codons for expression of the fluorescent protein. The nucleotide sequence of this humanized mutant is provided in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0057\" num=\"0000\"> C. Expression of Humanized drFP583 in Mammalian Cells </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0193\"> HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids pECFP-Nuc, pEYFP-Tub and pDsRed1-Mito (humanized drFP583). After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C. then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were mounted in mounting medium and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Images were taken of one cell co-expressing all three fluorescent proteins with Omega filter set XF 35 for DsRed1-Mito, XF 104 for EYFP-Tub and XF 114 for ECFP-Nuc using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Individual images were pseudocolored and overlayed to show all three signals in one image. Protein DsRed1-Mito localizes to mitochondria, EYFP-Tub localizes to the microtubular network, and ECFP-Nuc localizes to the nucleus. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0195\" num=\"0194\"> As a conclusion, drFP583 does emit to a low extent also in the cyan (ECFP), green (EGFP) and yellow-green (EYFP) emission channels (filter sets). High expression levels or highly concentrated protein in intracellular structures can therefore result in high signal intensities that will give some bleedthrough in the other emission wavelengths. The bleedthrough is small and should not affect multiple labeling recording in most cases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0058\" num=\"0000\"> D. Mutants of Humanized drFP583 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0196\" num=\"0195\"> Mutants of humanized drFP583 were generated using error prone PCR technique (Clontech). Mutations occurred at amino acids 42, 71, 105, 120, 161 and 197 (numbering starting from the first Methionine).

Characterization and Applications of E5 Mutant \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0196\"> E5 (V105A, S197T) changes its fluorescence from green to red over time both in vitro and in vivo, in <i>E. coli </i>and in mammalian cells. Also, E5 folds faster than wild type drFP583 both in. <i>E. coli </i>and mammalian cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0198\" num=\"0197\"> Since it allows the \u201ctwo color\u201d reporting mode for monitoring of the promoter activity, i.e., for both active or shutdown state of the promoter, there is a separate color, serving as an indicator of that state, E5 can be used as a transcriptional reporter. Different from \u201cone color\u201d mode, \u201ctwo color\u201d mode has a measurable signal (color) present for both states of the process as opposed to \u201cone color\u201d mode (e.g. destabilized GFP) wherein the absence of the color is an indicator of the second state. Namely, newly produced E5 protein fluoresces in green, indicating on-going promoter activity. Over time, the protein will mature, acquiring the red fluorescence. So if the promoter is no longer active, all the protein will eventually mature, resulting in the dominant red fluorescence. In case the promoter is still active both red and green fluorescence will be readily detected. Thus E5 as a \u201ctwo color\u201d reporter allows study of gene expression similar to destabilized GFP, but with permanent \u201csignature\u201d of past gene activity in the cells, tissues or entire organism. For example, at the tissue level, E5 may help to distinguish the stem cells from differentiated cells. Providing the promoter is only active in the stem cells, the E5 reporter will label the stem cell population in green and red, the progenitor cells would be labeled predominantly in red, the terminally differentiated will not fluoresce (due to the titration out of protein during cell division). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0199\" num=\"0198\"> E5 can be used for spatial and temporal visualization of newly synthesized vs. accumulated fusion proteins. That is, E5 could function like a fusion tag. Possible applications envisaged at different organizational levels. At the cellular level, E5 may help to visualize and distinguish the newly synthesized proteins in various compartments such as outer membrane, microvillae, ER, Golgi, mitochondria, nuclei, various components of cellular matrix and focal adhesion complexes. At the tissue level, E5 may be helpful in visualizing newly formed vs. preexisting structures e.g. membrane junctions, components of extracellular matrix. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0200\" num=\"0199\"> One of the most fascinating applications of E5 seems to be in the study of the mother-daughter relationship during the cell division and migration. A wide horizon is opening in the fields of development as well as in the adult organisms to study the cell migration and differentiation. Allowing visualization of the expression \u201chistory\u201d, E5 can help to distinguishing between the mother cells where the promoter is actually active vs. the daughter cells containing the accumulated protein but not producing fresh protein anymore. It would enable the study of the cell fates during development and organ remodeling, thus distinguishing between cell migration and cell expansion or differentiation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0201\" num=\"0200\"> In conclusion, E5 is basically applicable to any situation where GFP was previously used. Main advantage is that E5 can track down \u201cthe history\u201d of promoter activity or protein localization in cells or tissues. With a better protein stability than GFP, E5 allows longer analysis window (wild type drFP583 is stable for at least 4 weeks in <i>Xenopus</i>, while EGFP starts to faint after two weeks). </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0059\" num=\"0000\"> F. Characterization and Applications of E8 Mutant </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0202\" num=\"0201\"> E8 (N42H) has two fluorescence maximums, green and red, at all times and it folds much faster than drFP583 (Table 7). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0202\"> Since it detects both green and red fluorescence simultaneously, E8 may be useful for studying processes related to blood circulation and proteins/cells trafficking. Blood absorbs the green fluorescence; thus only the red fluorescence will be visible while the protein is trafficking in the blood. Both green and red fluorescence could be detected outside the bloodstream making the whole process easy to visualize and record.

Humanized drFP583/dmFP592 Hybrid and Mutants \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0207\"> drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid was humanized. Further, two mutants were generated based on the humanized drFP583/dmFP592, i.e., drFP583/dmFP592-2G and drFP583/dmFP592-Q3. drFP583/dmFP592-2G (i.e. 6/92G) contains two substitutions, K15Q and T217S (Self numbering). This mutant was derived from the humanized drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid gene by random mutagenesis using Diversity PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech) according to the corresponding protocol. drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 (6/9Q) contains three substitutions, K15Q and K83M and T217S (self numbering). drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 mutant was derived from drFP583/dmFP592-2G mutant by random mutagenesis using Diversity PCR Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech) according to the corresponding protocol. A non-aggregating mutant of 6/9Q, i.e. 6/9 QNA, was also produced, which the following substitutions: K5E, K9T, K15Q, K83M, T217S (self numbering). The sequences of a humanized 6/9 Q hybrid protein are provided in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0209\" num=\"0208\"> drFP583/dmFP592-2G has similar brightness and folding rate as for non-humanized drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid. While drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 could be seen in <i>E. coli </i>cells as more dark red than parental variant, i.e., drFP583/dmFP592-2G, and the purified protein solution has purple color. drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 has the emission maximum of 616 nm and excitation maximum of 580 nm. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0067\" num=\"0000\"> J. Applications of Hybrid Mutants </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0210\" num=\"0209\"> Similar to fluorescent protein drFP583 or dmFP592, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 can be used as a tool for investigation of protein expression, transport and protein interactions in vivo, monitoring of promoter activity, and as a transcription reporter or fusion tag. Besides, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 can be chosen as the most convenient partner to one of the existing green fluorescent protein variants in two/triple color labeling assays for simultaneous detection of expression of two or more proteins in vivo due to its strongly red-shifted position of emission maximum and practical absence of excitation in green part of spectrum except any spectral overlapping and background fluorescence. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0211\" num=\"0210\"> The method of generating drFP583/dmFP592 hybrid can have a general utility for generating hybrid genes (i.e., genes containing parts of different genes in various combinations) with improved fluorescent characteristics. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0212\" num=\"0211\"> Additionally, drFP583/dmFP592-Q3 is the first red-shifted mutant, which demonstrates that spectral-shifted mutant could be obtained by random mutagenesis. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0213\" num=\"0212\"> K.

Compared with wild type asFP600, Mut1 has the following substitutions: T68A and A143S from start of protein (T to A at position 70 and A to S at position 148 under numbering according to GFP). Target substitution A143S was generated by means of site-specific mutagenesis using PCR with primers that carried the mutation. During this mutagenesis random substitution T68A was generated by introducing a wrong nucleotide in PCR. The substitution T68A is not necessary for fluorescence and practically does not affect the fluorescence. Table 9 lists the spectral properties of Mut1.

Construction and Functional Analysis of Vectors \\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0215\" num=\"0214\"> Non-humanized mutant asFP600 (RNFP) DNA were amplified via PCR and reconstructed to EGFP-N1 backbone. This vector (pRNFP-N1) has the same multiple cloning sites as EGFP-N1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0216\" num=\"0215\"> Functional test of the generated vector was performed by transient transfection in 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of asFP600 was examined under fluorescent microscope. asFP600 showed good fluorescent intensity, however, the expression of asFP600 concentrated at the nucleus. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0068\" num=\"0000\"> C. Generation of Cytosal Expressed asFP600 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0217\" num=\"0216\"> Since the nuclear localization of asFP600 limited some of the application of this protein as transcription reporter or pH sensor, cytosal expression of this protein would be needed for this purpose. A nuclear export sequence in humanized codon usage was fused to the N-terminus of asFP600, and placed into the EGFP-N1 vector, resulted in pNE-RNFP. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0218\" num=\"0217\"> Functional test of NE-RNFP is performed by transient transfect the pNE-RNFP into 293 cells. 24 hours post transfection, expression of NE-RNFP is examined under fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence was observed to be distributed in the cytosol but not in the nucleus. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0069\" num=\"0000\"> D. Generation of Destabilized asFP600 Vectors as Transcription Reporters </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0219\" num=\"0218\"> Since asFP600 is very stable, it is necessary to generate destabilized versions of asFP600 in order to observe the rapid turnover of the protein. By using the same technology for destabilized EGFP, two destabilized NE-RNFP vectors were constructed by fusing mouse ODC degradation domain to the C-terminal of NE-RNFP. The d1 version of destabilized RNFP has three E to A mutations within MODC degradation domain comparing to d2 version, therefore result in a shorter half-life of the protein to which MODC degradation domain fused. Destabilized d1 RNFP and d2RNFP were constructed in EGFP-N1 backbone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0070\" num=\"0000\"> E. Functional Analysis of Destabilized asFP600 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0220\" num=\"0219\"> d2 version of the none-humanized asFP600 was transiently transfected into 293 cells. One day after transfection, CHX was added to inhibit protein synthesis. 3 hours after treatment, cells were examined under fluorescent microscope. It showed that fluorescent intensity decreased \u02dc50%. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0071\" num=\"0000\"> F. Construction and Functional Test for Humanized Mut1 </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0221\" num=\"0220\"> Humanized Mut1 was generated. The humanized Mut1 was then placed into the pEGFP-N1 backbone. This vector has the same multiple cloning sites as pEGFP-N1.

No. 11/407,701, filed Apr. 19, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto, in its entirety, and to which application we claim priority under 35 USC \u00a7120.  \\n      This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/833,284, filed Jul. 24, 2006, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/877,595, filed Dec. 28, 2006, both of which applications are hereby incorporated herein, in their entireties, by reference thereto.  \\n      This application also hereby incorporates herein by reference thereto, in its entirety, co-pending Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3) filed on even date herewith, and titled \u201cDevices and Methods for Treatment of Obesity\u201d. \\n    \\n    \\n     FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present invention relates to treatment of obesity, more particularly to implantable devices and methods of implanting the devices in the abdominal cavity to treat an obese patient.  \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n      Obesity has become a major health concern, both nationally and internationally. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) estimates that over 120 million Americans are overweight, including about 56% of the adult population. Of these, about 52 million are considered obese, as measured by a body mass index (BMI) of 30% or greater. In Europe, an estimated 77 million people are obese, as measured by the same standard. This problem is not limited to western nations, as many developing countries are reported to have obesity rates over 75% of the adult population.  \\n      Co-morbidities that are associated with obesity include, but are not limited to type II Diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, stroke and arthritis, the symptoms of which often tend to be lessened or alleviated upon loss of weight by a person so affected.  \\n      In the U.S., options for treatment of obesity are currently quite limited.  \\n      Current treatment methodologies typically rely upon surgically introducing a \u201cmalabsorptive\u201d environment in the gastro-intestinal tract, a restrictive environment, or a combination of these. One available treatment method is gastric bypass surgery and another is referred to as gastric banding (one of these techniques is referred to as the LAPBAND\u2122 procedure). These procedures are limited to only those patients with a BMI over 40 (or over 35, with co-morbidities present).  \\n      Gastric bypass procedures incur a great deal of morbidity and create a malabsorptive state in the patient by bypassing a large portion of the intestines.  \\n      Serious side effects, such as liver failure have been associated with this procedure, as well as chronic diarrhea. Another surgical procedure that has a high degree of morbidity associated with it is known as the \u201cGastric Bypass Roux-en-Y\u201d procedure. This procedure reduces the capacity of the stomach by creating a smaller stomach pouch. The small space holds only about one ounce of fluid. A tiny stomach outlet is also surgically created to slow the speed at which food leaves the stomach. Staples are used to create a small (15 to 20 cc) stomach pouch, with the rest of the stomach being stapled completely shut and divided from the stomach pouch. The small intestine is divided just beyond the duodenum, brought up, and connected to the newly formed stomach pouch. In addition to the considerable morbidity associated with this procedure, other disadvantages include \u201cdumping syndrome\u201d, where stomach contents are literally \u201cdumped\u201d rapidly into the small intestine which may lead to nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, and diarrhea; hernias resulting from the surgery; gallstones; leakage of the connection between the pouch and the intestine; stretching of the pouch that was formed; nutritional deficiencies; and possible dehiscence of the staples.  \\n      The LAPBAND\u2122 is a band that, when placed, encircles the fundus-cardia junction and is inflatable to constrict the same. It does not reduce the volume of the stomach, but rather restricts passage of food into the stomach, the theory being that the patient will feel satiety with a much smaller volume of food than previously. Although the LAPBAND\u2122 procedure is less invasive than a gastric bypass procedure, it also typically achieves less weight loss. Further, it is not a simple procedure and requires a substantial amount of training by a surgeon to become proficient in performing the procedure. Also, a substantial amount of dissecting and suturing is required because the pathway by which the band is introduced is not an existing pathway, and must be established by dissection. Great care is required to avoid blood vessels and nerves that may be in the intended pathway to be created by the dissection. After placing the band around the fundus-cardia junction, the ends of the band must be connected together and then it must be cinched down into place. Additionally, complications such as erosion at the fundus-cardia junction, slippage of the band from its intended location, nausea/vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, dysphagia and lack of effectiveness in causing weight loss have been reported.  \\n      Intragastric balloons have also been placed, in an attempt to fill a portion of the volume in the stomach, with the theory being that it will then require less food than previously, to give the patient a sensation of fullness or satiety. This procedure involves delivery of a balloon (typically, transorally) to the interior of the stomach and inflation of the balloon to take up a portion of the volume inside the stomach. However, intragastric balloons may also lead to complications such as obstruction, vomiting and/or mucosal erosion of the inner lining of the stomach. The balloon can break down over extended exposure to the stomach&#39;s acids, and in some cases, after breaking down, the balloon translated through the intestines and caused a bowel obstruction.  \\n      Gastrointestinal sleeves have been implanted to line the stomach and/or a portion of the small intestines to reduce the absorptive capabilities of the small intestine and/or to reduce the volume in the stomach, by reducing the available volume to the tubular structure of the graft running therethrough. Although weight loss may be effective while these types of devices are properly functioning, there are complications with anchoring the device within the stomach/GI tract, as the stomach and GI tract function to break down things that enter into them and to move/transport them through. Accordingly, the integrity of the anchoring of the device, as well as the device itself may be compromised over time by the acids and actions of the stomach and GI tract.  \\n      A sleeve gastrectomy is an operation in which the left side of the stomach is surgically removed. This results in a much reduced stomach which is substantially tubular and may take on the shape of a banana. This procedure is associated with a high degree of morbidity, as a large portion of the stomach is surgically removed. Additionally, there are risks of complications such as dehiscence of the staple line where the staples are installed to close the surgical incisions where the portion of the stomach was removed. Further, the procedure is not reversible.  \\n      In the laparoscopic duodenal switch, the size of the stomach is reduced in similar manner to that performed in a sleeve gastrectomy. Additionally, approximately half of the small intestine is bypassed and the stomach is reconnected to the shortened small intestine. This procedure suffers from the same complications as the sleeve gastrectomy, and even greater morbidity is associated with this procedure due to the additional intestinal bypass that needs to be performed. Still further, complications associated with malabsorption may also present themselves.  \\n      An inflatable gastric device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,893, in which a balloon is inserted anteriorly of the stomach and posteriorly of the left lobe of the liver. The balloon is then inflated to compress the stomach so that it fills with less food that would ordinarily be possible. Not only does this device compress the stomach, but it also compresses the liver, as seen in  FIG. 5  of the patent, which may cause complications with the liver function. Additionally, the balloon is simply placed into this location, and there is no assurance that it will not migrate and lose its effectiveness in compressing the stomach to the degree intended. Still further, the balloon is of a simple spherical design, and, as such, extends pressure outwardly in all directions, 360 degrees, in all planes.  \\n      Accordingly, the liver is compressed just as much as the stomach is. Also, the compression forces against the stomach are not ideal, as the spherical balloon conformation does not match the conformation of the expanding stomach. The stomach is not spherical when expanded, or concave with a constant radius of curvature, but expands into a designated space that allows the fundus to expand preferentially more than other parts of the stomach.  \\n      Brazzini et al. in WO2005/18417 discloses at least two or more expandable devices used to treat obesity, in which the devices are inserted through the abdominal wall and anchored against the external surface of the stomach wall by an anchoring mechanism that extends through the stomach wall and fixes to the internal surface of the stomach wall.  \\n      U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0261712 to Balbierz et al. describes capturing a device against the outer surface of the stomach wall to form a restriction that appears to function similarly to the restriction imposed by the LAPBAND\u2122. The anchoring of the devices disclosed relies upon placement of features against the internal wall of the stomach to form an interlock with the device which is placed against the external wall of the stomach.  \\n      U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0267533 and 2006/0212053 to Gertner disclose devices for treatment of obesity that use one or more anchoring mechanisms that are passed through the wall of the stomach to establish an anchor.  \\n      U.S. Pat. No. 6,981,978 to Gannoe discloses devices for reducing the internal cavity of the stomach to a much smaller volume, which may be used to carry out a bypass procedure. Stapling is employed to isolate the smaller volume in the stomach, and thus the same potential disadvantages are present as with other stapling procedures described herein.  \\n      U.S. Pat. No. 6,186,149 to Pacella et al. describes an occluder device that can be used as a dietary control device (see  FIG. 8C ). The occluder device is placed against the wall of the stomach and inflated to press inwardly on the stomach wall. A frame is wrapped around the stomach wall and is inflated to press against the stomach wall. However, there is no disclosure of how the frame might be adjusted to maintain a position relative to the stomach wall as the size of the stomach varies.  \\n      Gastric reduction techniques have been attempted, such as by inserting instruments trans-orally and reducing the volume of the stomach by stapling portions of it together. However, this technique is prone to failure due to the staples pulling through the tissues that they are meant to bind.  \\n      Techniques referred to as gastric pacing endeavor to use electrical stimulation to simulate the normal feedback mechanisms of a patient that signal the brain that the patient is full, or satiated. While these techniques are less invasive than some of the other existing treatments, statistics to date have shown that the amount of weight lost by using such techniques is less than satisfactory.  \\n      Currently marketed drugs for weight loss, such as XENICAL\u00ae, MERIDIA\u00ae and Phen fen have largely failed, due to unacceptable side effects and complications, and sometimes to an ineffective amount of weight loss. Other drugs that are on the horizon include ACCOMPLIA\u00ae and SYMLIN\u00ae, but these are, as yet, unproven.  \\n      The risk and invasiveness factors of currently available surgeries are often too great for a patient to accept to undergo surgical treatment for his/her obesity.  \\n      Accordingly, there is a need for less invasive, yet effective surgical treatment procedures for morbidly obese patients (patients having a BMI of 35 or greater). Also, since the current surgical procedures are currently indicated only for those patients having a BMI of 40 or greater, or 35 or greater when co-morbidities are present, it would be desirable to provide a surgical procedure that would be, available for slightly less obese patients, e.g., patients having a BMI of 30 to 35 who are not indicated for the currently available surgical procedures. It would further be desirable to provide a surgical procedure that would be indicated for obese patients having a BMI in the range of 30-35, as well as for more obese patients.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE

INVENTION  \\n      Before the present devices and methods are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims.  \\n      Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed.

Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided may be different from the actual publication dates which may need to be independently confirmed.  \\n      Definitions  \\n      A \u201ccompliant\u201d material refers to a material that is stretchable or expandable. This expansibility allows the material to increase in dimension substantially more than a noncompliant or semi-compliant material, prior to failure. For example, when formed as a balloon structure, a compliant material comprises an expansibility property of being able to increase its radius, beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, by 100 percent or more, without rupturing.  \\n      A \u201cnoncompliant\u201d material refers to a material that, when formed as a balloon structure, can increase its radius beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, only up to about 10 percent or less prior to rupturing.  \\n      A \u201csemi-compliant\u201d material refers to a material that, when formed as a balloon structure, can increase its radius beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, by an amount between about 10 percent and about 100 percent, prior to rupturing.  \\n      The \u201cwall\u201d of the stomach refers to all of the layers that make up the stomach wall, including the mucosa, submucosa, muscular layers and serosa. A \u201clayer\u201d, \u201clayer of the stomach wall\u201d or \u201cstomach wall layer\u201d refers to a mucosal layer, submucosal layer, muscular layer or serosal layer.  \\n      A \u201cproximal\u201d end of an instrument is the end that is nearer the surgeon when the surgeon is using the instrument for its intended surgical application.  \\n      A \u201cdistal\u201d end of an instrument is the end that is further from the surgeon when the surgeon is using the instrument for its intended surgical application.  \\n      An \u201cinternal body structure\u201d when referred to as a structure to which a device is to be anchored, refers to a structure internal to the skin of a patient, and which can be within the abdominal cavity of the patient, or just outside of it, such as including the outer surface of a wall that partially defines the abdominal cavity. Structures to which a device can be anchored include, but are not limited to: one or more ribs, the intercostal muscles, the abdominal surface of the diaphragm, the stomach (but where the anchor does not pass through the wall of the stomach), the anterior abdominal wall, the posterior abdominal wall and the lateral abdominal wall, the esophagus, the angle of his in the stomach, the gastro-intestinal junction, the gastro-esophageal junction, the columnar ligaments of the diaphragm near the gastro-esophageal junction, the superior aspect of the omentum, peritoneum, liver, connective tissues, ligaments, and blood vessels.  \\n      A \u201cbody floss wire\u201d is a wire that enters and exits the body in two locations and passes inside the body between the two locations. This arrangement allows excellent control of the tension on the wire, as forces can be applied at both end portions of the wire that enter and exit the body. Additionally, this arrangement provides good control of devices being passed along the wire.  \\n      The preferred embodiments of the present invention prevent the possible issue of erosion caused by an expandable member, by not requiring anchoring to the stomach, and further, by not requiring a compression force to be applied when the stomach is not full of food. By allowing the stomach to move freely in the constrained spaced provided by the expandable member, the stomach&#39;s possible expansion size will be decreased, but there will be less opportunity for the formation of pressure necrosis since no one region will be subjected to concentrated forces. With the device in place, there is substantially no distensibility of the stomach as normal exists with an unconstrained stomach. With distensibility restricted and gastric volume reduced, as the patient ingests food, the intra-gastric pressure will rise to a level sufficient to produce satiety without distension or volume expansion of one or more regions of the stomach. The device occupies so much volume in the abdominal cavity that the stomach does not substantially depart from the shape set by the device even when filled with food. Another physiological benefit of the device is that the stomach&#39;s ability to relax in response to ingestion of food is reduced or eliminated, through producing earlier satiety. One additional physiological benefit of the expandable member may further be to substantially reduce the actual volume of the stomach itself, remodeling the organ as the muscle contracts into its new shape over the period of weeks or months Oust as the heart remodels when constrained from over-expansion). Remodeling the stomach allows the expandable member to be implanted temporarily. The preferred embodiments also are positioned in a location to completely or mostly fill the space normally occupied by the fundus, thus moving the stomach medially and wedging the stomach between the expandable member and the medial and anterior aspects of the liver, and the spine posteriorly. This position also ensures that the expandable member is almost entirely maintained underneath the diaphragmatic umbrella beneath the ribs on the left side, thus concealing the expandable member, and preventing it from producing an unsatisfactory cosmetic result. Further, the preferred embodiments can have elements for anchoring on one or more locations along the abdominal cavity wall to prevent migration. Further, the preferred embodiments are provided with an outer surface that is very atraumatic. Embodiments described at least one expandable member, preferably an inflatable member, made of a material or material composite that is impermeable to gas, as well as embodiments having at least two expandable members, with one expandable member being inflated with a gas and another expandable member being inflated with a liquid.  \\n      The device embodiments of the present invention can be placed with a number of minimally invasive techniques, such as those often referred to as percutaneous, laparoscopic, mini-laparoscopic, or key-hole. Particularly important in at least one embodiment, the procedure requires no general anesthesia and typically only a single, small opening in a patient is required to deliver an implantable device. In particular, in at least one embodiment the procedure can be performed outside of an operating room setting with local anesthesia or conscious sedation and generally without pressurized insufflation.  \\n      Abdominal Cavity Anatomy  \\n       FIG. 1  illustrates the anatomy of the abdominal cavity and its contents, and surrounding features. The abdominal cavity  100  is shown divided among four quadrants, the upper right quadrant  102 , upper left quadrant  104 , lower left quadrant  106  and lower right quadrant  108 , as divided by the median axis  110  and transverse axis  112 . The lower edge of the ribcage is illustrated by the dotted line  114  and the diaphragm is shown at  116 . As seen in  FIGS. 1A and 1B , the diaphragm  116  is shaped like a parachute and sits within the ribs. The esophagus  118  passes through the diaphragm  116  and joins with the stomach  120 . The left lobe  122  of the liver  121  lies anteriorly of the esophagus  118  and the fundus-cardia junction  119 . In one aspect of the invention, an expandable device is implanted in an extra-gastric location (i.e., outside of the stomach) generally indicated at  124 , and then expanded to occupy a space that the fundus of the stomach would ordinarily expand into when the stomach is filled with food. The expanded device prevents this expansion by the fundus, thereby limiting the volume of the cavity in the stomach to a much smaller volume than if the fundus had been allowed to expand into the space. Alternatively, the device is expanded to apply pressure to the fundus of the stomach in a downward direction (e.g., in a direction toward the transverse axis  112  shown, with some transverse movement toward the median axis  110  shown), and optionally, additionally to the main body of the stomach, to reduce the volume inside the stomach to effect satiety in the patient with relatively less food ingested, relative to what the patient would require for satiety without the implant in place.  \\n      Devices  \\n      At least some embodiments of devices described herein can be implanted percutaneously, with a relatively quick and simple procedure that requires no general anesthesia and wherein only a single, small opening in a patient is required to deliver the device, which typically has a single expandable member that is self anchoring or can be easily anchored to maintain the simplicity and minimal invasiveness of the procedure.  \\n      In other embodiments, more complex configurations of expandable members are provided, where a device can contain one or more expandable members and implantation and anchoring can be performed laparoscopically. Any of the devices described herein can, of course, be implanted using open surgical procedures. Devices that can be implanted percutaneously can alternatively be implanted using laparoscopic procedures.  \\n      Devices described herein can be implanted permanently, but are also configured for reversibility, to facilitate relatively simple removal procedures, should it be desired to remove a device. Alternatively, devices according to the present invention can be implanted temporarily, such as over a period of months, and then removed or disabled when further treatment is no longer required, or to allow an alternative treatment to be applied.  \\n      Device Body Configurations  \\n       FIGS. 3A and 3B  show views of a device  10  having a main body  10   m,    10   em  with a shape and size approximating the shape and size of the full (post-prandial) stomach  120   b.  Although main body  10   m  need not be expandable/collapsible to perform restriction of stomach expansion, main body  10   m  is typically formed from one or more expandable members  10   em  as will be described in further detail below, for better performance of intended functions and to allow less invasive procedures for implanting the same.  \\n      Main body  10   m,   10   em  includes curved left and right sides  10   l  and  10   r,  respectively ( FIG. 3A  shows the posterior surface of main body  10   m,   10   em ), wherein the left side  10   l  is convex and the right side  10   r  is concave such that the main body  10   m,    10   em  takes on a somewhat kidney-shaped configuration. However, the superior portion  10 s is substantially larger and more bulbous than the inferior portion  10   i,  since the fundus portion of the stomach  120  expands much more than the antrum upon receiving food. Thus, as seen in the right side view of  FIG. 3B , the superior portion  10   s  is very bulbous and almost spherical, with a larger cross section than the inferior portion  10   i,  while the inferior portion is more nearly hemispherical, with the center portion of the main body tapering from the superior portion  10   s  to the inferior portion  10   i.  Configured as such, the main body  10   m,   10   em,  when implanted properly, will occupy the space that naturally exists from the stomach  120  to expand into when expanding from a pre-prandial configuration to a post-prandial configuration. By severely limiting this expansion capability, the patient is thereby able to consume only a significantly smaller volume of food than possible if the implant were not present.  \\n      Device  10  sizes will likely vary depending on the size of the skeletal system of the patient into which device  10  is to be implanted, particularly the size of the rib cage. Further variations may be made to tweak or adjust the amount of restriction along any desired location of the stomach that interfaces with device  10 . One typical variation is in the length and/or size (diameter or expandability capacitance) of the inferior portion  10   i.    FIGS. 3C and 3D  illustrate two variations of device  10  in which the inferior portion of the expandable member  10   em  in  FIG. 3D  is longer and thus extends further inferiorly and medially than the inferior portion of the expandable member shown in  FIG. 3C . In both cases, expandable member is shown in an expanded configuration, and a full, unrestricted stomach  120  is illustrated behind the expandable member  10   em  to illustrate the relative amount of restriction that each expandable member shown would impose on the stomach  120 .  \\n      At least a portion of main body member  10   m  may be expandable. The entire main body  10 m may be made of an expandable member  10   em.  When in an expanded configuration, expandable member  10   em  can optionally only abut or lie adjacent to the pre-prandial stomach wall, without imparting any significant deformation forces thereto. However, when the patient eats and the stomach begins to fill, expandable member  10   em  in this case prevents the stomach  120  from expanding into the volume occupied by expandable member  10   em.  In such a case, the stomach  120  becomes \u201cdeformed\u201d as it attempts to expand and can only expand in a limited fashion, if at all, around a portion of the perimeter of expandable member  10   em.  Thus, upon expanding the device  10 , the device  10  expands in the space(s) normally occupied by the stomach  120  as the stomach  120  expands when receiving food. Thus device  10  exerts pressure on, or at least prevents expansion of the fundus and optionally, the antrum. In embodiments where the expandable device  10  is not attached to the stomach, the stomach is free to perform its normal function of mixing food in the stomach for digesting and pushing food out of the stomach. During all of this movement the stomach may slip behind, beside or on top of the expandable device, but the internal volume of the stomach will be held to its smaller volume as the expandable device  10   em  is occupying the space into which the stomach would normally expand. Further details of methods for treatment of obesity, including procedures for implanting devices described herein are described below.  \\n      As noted above, an expandable device  10  can be implanted adjacent a surface of the stomach wall, either in contact therewith or at a predetermined distance therefrom, to prevent expansion of the stomach  120  into a volume occupied by the expandable device  10 . Alternatively, some embodiments of the devices described herein can be configured and placed to exert an external compression on one or more locations of the stomach to deform the stomach wall, thereby decreasing the internal volume of the cavity within the stomach that accepts food and liquid intake.  FIG. 4  illustrates (by arrows) potential locations on the stomach  120  wall that can be compressed (or restricted from expanding) by one or more devices  10  as described herein.  \\n      In one embodiment, expandable member  10   em  shown in  FIGS. 3A-3B  is composed of an inflatable member  10   em.  Inflatable members described herein can be inflated with gas or liquid or both. Examples of gases or liquids that can be used to inflate inflatable members/devices  10  include, but are not limited to: carbon dioxide, helium, isotonic dextrose solution, iostonic saline solution, air.  \\n      It may be preferable to inflate at least a portion of the expandable member  10   em  shown in  FIGS. 3A-3B  with one or more gases, to minimize the weight of the implanted device  10 , as an expandable member of the configuration shown can have an internal volume approaching a liter, when filled, and a heavier, fluid-filled device of this type may be more noticeable to the patient. Alternatively, devices  10  can be inflated with a porous gel that is porous or microporous to encapsulate air or other gas bubbles, thereby reducing the weight of the gel while still permitting it to apply volumetric pressure to expand an inflatable member. Such gels may be settable, such as ultra-violet (uv) curable or otherwise chemically curable, or, alternatively, can remain in the gel state, so that they can be readily removed or added to, to increase or decrease the amount of inflation/expansion of the expandable member. Gels can be made from a flowable viscoelastic substance made of a polymer mixture, such as silicone oil, boric acid, hyaluronic acid, polyacrylic acid or combinations thereof, for example. The gel, as delivered into the expandable member  10   em  (e.g., such as by injection or the like) can be aerated or infused with carbon dioxide or an inert gas to create a deformable or non-deformable cellular structure that encapsulates the gas in cells, and thus has relatively low mass but still has significant resistance to compression or deformation.  \\n      When inflating an inflatable member with a pressurized gas, some materials, especially the compliant materials such as silicone, polyurethane and the like, may have an inherent porosity as it is stretched during the expansion, such that it may not adequately maintain a desired pressure within the membrane or wall of the inflatable member over an extended period of time. This seepage or slow leakage of gas from the inflatable member may require a patient to have the implant checked more frequently then required for other physiological concerns, to ensure that it is maintaining adequate pressure and thus is expanded to the extent desired to perform the desired amount of deformation of the stomach. Materials such as silicone and polyurethane have a good history of long term biocompatibility when used as implants and are two of the preferred materials for use in making devices  10 .  \\n      The inflatable members of the inflatable devices described herein can include compliant, noncompliant or semi-compliant materials, or any combination of these. Examples of compliant materials suitable for use in an inflatable member as described herein include, but are not limited to: silicone, latex rubber, and polyurethane. Examples of useable semi-compliant materials include, but are not limited to: nylon, polyethylene, polyester, polyamide and polyurethane, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,148, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. Polyurethane, nylon, polyethylene and polyester can be compliant or semi-compliant materials, depending upon the specific formulation and hardness or durometer of the material as produced. Examples of noncompliant materials that can be used in the construction of inflatable members described herein include, but are not limited to: polyethylene terepthalate (PET) and urethane. Urethane can be a compliant, semi-compliant or non-compliant material depending upon its specific formulation and hardness or durometer. Compliant, semi-compliant and noncompliant categories are not solely material limited, but are better defined by their expansion characteristics, as noted above. Some materials are best suited for use in one of these categories (e.g., silicone and latex work well to make compliant structures), but other materials can be formulated and/or constructed to provide compliant, semi-compliant or noncompliant properties.  \\n      One way of eliminating or substantially reducing seepage, such as when an expandable member comprises a compliant material that is stretched to a degree that would normally exhibit such seepage, is to provide a very thin metallic coating over the compliant material using a biocompatible metal to form the coating, as the metal layer is substantially nonporous when the integrity of such layer is maintained.  FIG. 5  is a photograph of an expandable member  10   em  formed by sputtering a layer of titanium over a polyurethane expandable member formed in a shape as described with regard to  FIGS. 3A-3B  above.  FIG. 5  shows the expandable member  10   em  in an expanded configuration. In order to avoid wrinkles in the metallized layer of the expandable member  10   em,  the compliant material (e.g., polyurethane in this case) was stretched over a mold configured in an expanded shape of the expandable member and welded in this three dimensional configuration, while inverting the seams, so that the smooth, seamless configuration shown resulted. Other biocompatible metals (e.g., silver, gold, tantalum, palladium, platinum or some other biocompatible metal) may be substituted for titanium, and compliant materials other than polyurethane (e.g., silicone, latex rubber, etc.) can be substituted for the substrate of such an expandable member  10   em.    \\n      Another approach to reducing seepage is by co-extrusion, e.g., co-extruding EVOH (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer) and polyurethane to form the expandable member  10   em,  with or without a metallic coating as described above.  \\n      Further descriptions of methods and materials for making a metallic coated expandable member can be found in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595 which was incorporated by reference above.  \\n       FIG. 6  illustrates an embodiment of a device that employs two expandable members  10   em   1  and  10   em   2 . The two expandable members in this case are separately and independently expandable, and may be expanded both by the same expansion medium (or by mechanical expansion methods/features described herein), or may be expanded by different expansion media or techniques or mechanical features, to provide what is termed herein as a hybrid device. In the example shown in  FIG. 6 , both expandable members  10   em   1  and  10   em   2  are designed to be inflated by gas, liquid, combination of gas and liquid, foams or any of the other inflation media described above. In one particular hybrid embodiment, expandable member  10   em   1  is inflated by one or more gases and expandable member  10   em   2  is inflated by a liquid such as isotonic saline or isotonic dextrose solution, for example. Since expandable member  10   em   1  contains a large volume, as noted above, this expandable member is inflated with a gas so as to be less noticeable by the recipient patient when implanted. In use of this hybrid configuration, expandable member  10   em   1  is fully inflated to occupy the space into which the stomach would normally expand when taking in food. Accordingly, expandable member  10   em   1  may be designed as a \u201cfixed volume\u201d expandable member, such that this expandable member will be expanded to a predetermined pressure so as to occupy a known volume. Expandable member  10   em   2 , having a much smaller expanded volume than expandable member  10   em   1  (for example, the volume of  10   em   1  can be about 75 to about 80 percent of the total volume of the implant, i.e., about 75 to 80 percent of the combined volumes of  10   em   1 + 10   em   2 ) uses a liquid medium for expansion thereof, as noted above. Expandable member  10   em   2  may be designed as a variable volume expandable member, so that expansion thereof can be varied to add to the fixed volume of expandable member  10   em   1  in the amount desired. In use, this liquid medium can be used to adjust the degree of expansion of expandable  10   em   2 , once the expansion of expandable member  10   em   1  has already been established to further compress into the stomach  120  or to better interface with the surface of the stomach, as the liquid in a less than fully expanded expandable member  10   em   2  is able to conform well to the surface shape of the stomach.  \\n      One particular location that many surgeons are interested in restricting and/or compressing is the Angle of His, and expandable member  10   em   2  is placed to provide further compression capability at this location of the stomach  120  when device  10  is implanted as described. Also, since liquid is relatively incompressible, expandable member  10   em   2  exhibits less give, causing the stomach to be deformed at the interface between the stomach and expandable member  10   em   2 , rather than compression of expandable member  10   em   2 . Further, the liquid-filled chamber  10   em   2  provides a softer surface to interface with the stomach then would the surface of a pressurized, fully expanded gas-filled chamber. Still further, because liquid is relatively incompressible, a user knows how much additional volume the expandable member  10   em   2  is being expanded by (and thus also the relative degree of additional compression provided) when a specific volume of liquid is inputted through lumen  122 . Thus, for example, if a physician adds 60 cc of liquid through lumen  122 , the physician will know that the volume of expandable member  10   em   2  has expanded by 60cc. Further, the use of liquid in the expandable member (such as expandable member  10   em   2 ) may provide relatively more pressure in preventing expansion of the stomach due to the density of the device, relative to one that is filled with gas. Further, the liquid may feel more \u201corgan-like\u201d, since organs are primarily liquid, and therefore be generally better tolerated by the stomach and other organs in the abdominal cavity. Still further, expandable member  10   em   1  can be expanded to a state where the properties of this expandable chamber do not exhibit significant seepage, so that this pressure can be maintained for an extended period of time. Expandable member  10   em   2  on the other hand, can be expanded to a much greater percentage without concern about seepage, since materials used are much less porous to liquid. For example, expandable member  10   em   1  may be made of one or more plies of titanium-coated polyurethane, as described above, and expandable member  10   em   2  may be formed of silicone. For example, the silicone expandable member  10   em   2  can expand up to at least 800 percent of its normal volume.  \\n      In the example shown in  FIG. 6 , expandable member  10   em   2  is shown partially inflated. When fully deflated, the external surface of expandable member  10   em   2  can be compressed to contact and conform to the adjacent wall of expandable member  10   em   1  that it overlies. Further infusion of fluid into expandable member  10   em   2  causes it to expand outwardly in the directions indicated by the arrows in  FIG. 6 . Thus, as can be seen, expandable member  10   em   2  in this example has been placed to primarily effect compression of the fundus (or further reduction of the space provided for the fundus to normally expand into). However, the invention is not limited to this design, as expandable member  10   em   2  could be lengthened to also provide further expandability in the region of the antrum of the stomach, or could be provided to expand only against the antrum. Further, other placements of such a secondary expandable member  10   em   2  can be designed to tailor the directionality of additional compression forces (and/or space filling) to be applied.  \\n      In  FIG. 6 , a dual lumen conduit  12  is provided for inputting expansion media into the two expandable members  10   em   1  and  10   em   2 . Thus lumen  12   1  leads to expandable member  10   em   1  and lumen  122  extends into expandable member  10   em   1  and leads into expandable member  10   em   2 . Alternatively, lumen  122  can extend externally over expandable member  10   em   1  and then enter into expandable member  10   em   2 .  \\n      Further variations and embodiments of devices having expandable members  10   em   1  and  10   em   2  are described in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595 which was incorporated by reference above.  \\n      The reduction in volume of the \u201cfull\u201d stomach that can be achieved by filling the space that the stomach normally expands into and/or compression of the stomach that is achievable by any of the devices described is in the range of about 700 cc to about 1,200 cc. The adjustable range of device  10  can be about zero cc to about 650 cc or about 50 to 600 ml, typically about 100 to 500 ml or 100 to 400 ml, wherein variations in these ranges can be achieved by varying the degree of expansion of one or more expandable members  10   em.  With a hybrid device described above the expandable member  10   em   1  is expanded to occlude most, if not all of the space into which the fundus (and optionally antrum) would normally expand when taking in food, with any medial space remaining between expandable member  10   em   1  and the empty stomach being fillable by adjusting the degree of expansion of expandable member  10   em   2 . Thus, for example, if the full volume capacity of a stomach  120  (with no implant impeding its expansion) is about 1,000 cc, then device  10  can be configured to initially displace about 400 to 600 cc of volume, so that the stomach&#39;s remaining capacitance is about 400 to 600 cc. Over time, device  10  can be expanded to occupy 800 to 900 cc of space, so that the stomach&#39;s capacity is reduced to about 100 to 200 cc. This adjustment can be done incrementally over time, for example. A hybrid device  10  such as the one described with regard to  FIG. 6  can be implanted and the initial volume displacement referred to can be achieved by inflating expandable member  10   em   1  with gas, for example. Further subsequent reductions in the stomach&#39;s capacity can be achieved by adding fluid to expandable member  10   em   2  to expand this member as desired.  \\n      As noted above, the expandable members described herein may be expanded by an expansion medium (such as liquid, gas, gas and liquid, foam, etc.) or by mechanical expansion methods and/or features. It should be further noted here that a single expandable member can be expanded (and/or maintained at a desired degree of expansion) by a combination of one or more expansion media and one or more mechanical expansion methods and/or features. We refer to these as complex expandable members and examples of such are described below. Thus, for example, an expandable member that is inflated by gas pressure may be further supported by some other expansion means, such as a mechanical expansion member. This mechanical expansion member can alleviate some of the pressure that would otherwise be required to maintain the expandable member at a predetermined size (volume). Further, if seepage occurs, the secondary (mechanical) expansion member can maintain the expandable member at the desired volume. It is further noted here that a complex expandable member can be used in a device  10  having a single expandable member, such as like that shown in  FIG. 5 , or may be combined with one or more additional expandable members, e.g., like the example shown in  FIG. 6 , wherein the one or more additional expandable members may be expandable by expansion medium or expansion method and/or features, or may also be a complex expandable member. In at least one embodiment, device  10  is provided with a complex expandable member having the shape of expandable member  10   em,  in  FIG. 6  above, and a second expandable member  10   em   2 , like that described in  FIG. 6  above is provided as a fluid expandable member. Further examples and embodiments of devices employing at least one complex expandable member are provided in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595.  \\n       FIGS. 7A-7C  illustrate a \u201cnested chamber\u201d configuration of an expandable member  10   em,  in which chambers  10   c   1 - 10   c   4  (although different numbers of chambers can be provided, which number may be two, three, or more than four) can be sequentially expanded, to vary the size of the expandable member and thus the amount of restriction and/or compression of the stomach to be applied by device  10 . Adjacent chambers are separated by a baffle or membrane  36  that may be formed of the same material as the wall of expandable member  10   em,  with each baffle or membrane  36  containing at least one one-way valve  38  therein. Valves  38  are configured to open at progressively greater pressures, so that the chambers can be opened sequentially and only to the extent desired, based on the amount of pressure applied through conduit  12 . Reduction in the overall volume of expandable member  10 em can be achieved by passing a guide wire through conduit  12  and through all valves  38 . Valves  38  open when the guidewire is extended therethrough, allowing the contents of each chamber to funnel out through conduit  12 , thereby deflating the expandable member. After this, the chambers can again be sequentially inflated as described to achieve the desired volume.  \\n      More specifically, in the example shown, the valve  38  in the membrane  36  separating chambers  10   c   1  and  10   c   2  opens at a lower pressure than the valve  38  in membrane  36  separating chambers  10   c   2  and  10   c   3 . Similarly, the valve  38  in membrane  26  separating chambers  10   c   2  and  10   c   3  opens at a lower pressure than the valve  38  in membrane  36  separating chambers  10   c   3  and  10   c   4 . The relative locations of the chambers are not limited to those shown, but can be altered to utilize the effects of the pressure-controlled sequential expansion to first occupy primary spaces desired to be filled to block expansion of the stomach, or to apply pressure to the stomach, with subsequently expanding chambers expanding to provide supplemental space filling//pressure in adjacent areas. An operator could choose only to inflate chamber  10   c   1  by inflating to a pressure less than that at which the valve  38  between chambers  10   c   1  and  10   c   2  opens at. In  FIG. 7A , expandable member has been inflated to a pressure greater than the pressure at which valve  38  separating chambers  10   c   1  and  10   c   2  opens at. Therefore, both chambers  10   c   1  and  10   c   2  have been inflated. This may provide sufficient restriction/compression for some patients, or for initial treatment of a patient. In some cases, even inflation of only chamber  10   c   1  may be sufficient for early treatment or for patient&#39;s having a relatively small rib cage, for example. After progress in losing weight has been made over time, or for patients with a larger rib cage, for example, the operator may want to increase the size and/or length of expandable member  10 em (in the example shown, both are accomplished). By inputting more gas through conduit  12  to establish a higher pressure to meet or exceed the pressure at which valve  38  (positioned between chambers  10   c   2  and  10   c   3 ) opens, valve  38  is force open, thereby inflating chamber  10   c   3 , as illustrated in  FIG. 7B . Chamber  10   c   4  can be inflated by increasing the pressure still further to open the valve  38  between chambers  10   c   3  and  10   c   4 , as illustrated in  FIG. 7C .  \\n      Any inflatable expandable member  10   em  described herein, whether inflatable by gas, liquid or some combination thereof may be provided with a safety valve. Thus, for example,  FIG. 8A  illustrates each of expandable members  10   em   1  and  10   em   2  being provided with a safety valve  40 . Safety valve  40  may be a flapper valve or other type of pressure release valve that opens when a predetermined pressure has been exceeded. Thus, safety valve  40  prevents overpressurization/overfilling of the expandable member that it is installed in. Safety valve  40  can be particularly valuable if the patient that the expandable member is implanted in is subjected to trauma (e.g., automobile accident, fall or other sudden impact that would spike the pressure in the expandable member and possibly cause catastrophic failure), or, in the case of an expandable member inflated with gas, in situations such as cabin depressurization in an aircraft, etc. When pressure within the expandable member has returned below the predetermined pressure (through escape of gas and or fluid from the safety valve  40 ) safety valve closes again, thereby retaining the remaining gas and/or fluid.  \\n       FIG. 8B  illustrates an alternative embodiment, in which safety valve  40  is in fluid communication with a reserve expandable member  10   emr.  In this case, if the patient is exposed to any of the conditions described above (which may also include simply moving from a low altitude location, e.g., sea level, to a location high in the mountains, for example) or any condition that would cause expandable member  10 em to significantly expand, thereby causing the compliant material that it is made of to become more porous resulting in leakage of gas therethrough, the rise in relative pressure that would ordinarily cause such an expansion instead opens safety valve  40  and gas passes therethrough and into reserve expandable member  10   emr  that is formed of a noncompliant material. Reserve expandable member  10   emr  is shown in an expanded configuration in phantom lines in  FIG. 8B . The noncompliant material of reserve expandable member  10   emr  prevent gas loss, and the gas in reserve expandable member  10   emr  can then be recaptured into expandable member  10 em when the patient has returned to the \u201cnormal\u201d altitude from where he started, or once the traumatic event has ended.  \\n       FIGS. 9A-9C  illustrate an expandable member  10   em  that includes excess material for additional expansion capacitance, whether inflated by gas or liquid or some combination thereof. Expandable member  10 em can be made from any of the materials and by any of the techniques described previously. In this embodiment, excess material  42  is provided, such as in the form of pleats, folds, corrugations, or the like, and this portion of the expandable member does not expand upon initial expansion of the expandable member. That is, at a first pressure P 1 , at which the expandable member  10 em is inflated (see  FIG. 9A ), the excess material  42  remains in its compact configuration. At a somewhat higher pressure P 2 &gt;P 1 , the excess material begins expanding, see  FIG. 9B . The amount of this expansion can be varied by varying the inflation pressure, so as to control the amount of additional expansion of expandable member  10   em  via expansion of excess material  42 .  FIG. 9C  shows expansion member  10   em  fully expanded, such as when a pressure P 3 &gt;P 2  or pressure higher than P 3  has been inputted to expandable member to cause a complete expansion of the excess material. The folds of the excess material  42  may be thicker and/or less compliant than the material that makes up the rest of the expandable member  10   em  in order to provide the additional resistance to expansion. Alternatively, or additionally, the folds of the excess material may be partially and temporarily fixed together, such as by partial thermal bonding or other mechanism of adhesion, for example.  \\n       FIGS. 10A-10F  illustrate an expandable member  10   em  that is formed from a linear string of multiple expandable cells  46 , that can be inserted into the patient one at a time, thereby minimizing the inside diameter requirement of an introducer used to deliver the expandable cells  46 . Cells  46  may all be inflated together, substantially simultaneously. Alternatively, valves may be provided between the cells so that they can be sequentially, individually inflated. Further alternatively, the valves may allow sequential inflation, all at the same time with a single inflation step, but prevent loss of inflation media once it has entered the cells. Accordingly, if one cell fails and deflates, the remainder of the cells  46  remain fully inflated. Accordingly, this embodiment lends itself very well to percutaneous implantation procedures. Of course this embodiment could also be implanted using laparoscopic procedures or open surgical procedures, but it provides a particular advantage for use in percutaneous delivery, as noted. Typically the cells  46  are inflated after delivery into the abdominal cavity. However, the cells  46  may alternatively be inflated while outside of the patient&#39;s body and then inserted into the abdominal cavity.  \\n      Cells  46  of expandable member  10   em  are connected in fluid communication with one another via conduits  12  that connect adjacent cells  46 . Conduits  12  are flexible, so that the string or chain of cells  46  can be readily deformed and manipulated to assume a variety of shapes. One or more anchoring tabs  48  are provided extending from each cell  46 , but not in fluid communication with the cell  48 , so that these tabs  48  can be sutured through, tacked or stapled without losing pressure from the cell  46 .  \\n       FIG. 10B  illustrates a cartridge  50  that expandable member  10   em  can be delivered from during a percutaneous implantation, to deliver cells  46  into a patient&#39;s abdominal cavity. The cells  46  and interconnecting conduits  12  that form the long string of the expandable member are rolled or bunched up inside of cartridge  50  for subsequent one at a time delivery of cells  46  into the patient&#39;s anatomy.  FIG. 10C  shows an introducer  52  that is configured to receive cartridge  50  and advance the string of cells  46  one at a time therefrom for delivery thereof, as described below. After insertion of cartridge  50  into introducer  52 , as indicated by the arrow between  FIGS. 10B and 10C , and formation of a small percutaneous opening into a patient&#39;s abdominal cavity (e.g., less than about 7 cm or less than about 6 cm or less than about 5 cm or less than about 4 cm or less than about 3 cm), the distal end of introducer  50  is inserted into the abdominal cavity and located adjacent a target surgical site where it is desired to fill space to restrict the expansion capacity of the stomach and/or to apply compression to the stomach, as schematically illustrated in  FIG. 10D . Note that expandable member  10   em  has been arranged in the introducer so that the distal most tab  48  extends distally of the distal end of introducer  52 .  \\n      Upon positioning the distal end of introducer  52  at the target location, the distal most tab  48  can then be fixed to anchor the distal most cell in a desired location. Anchoring can be performed by stapling, tacking or suturing, for example, and can be to any structure adjacent the stomach  120 , but typically not to the stomach  120  itself. Typically, cells  46  will be stapled via tabs  48  to at least one of the diaphragm  116  and anterior abdominal wall  127 . With this initial fixation, the first (i.e., distal-most) cell  46  can be driven out of introducer  50 , such as by actuation of actuator  54 , for example. Alternatively, actuator  54  may be configured to install staples, tacks or sutures through tabs  48 , and cells  46  may be removed from introducer, by retracting the introducer proximally to draw the fixed cell  46  out of the distal end of the introducer, see  FIG. 20E . Cells  46  can be inflated individually after stapling or other fixation, or may all be inflated after finishing of the installation of all cells  46  to be used, or may be inflated prior to installing. The introducer can then be advanced distally again to the target location to anchor the next in line cell  46 . This process can be repeated until as many cells  46  have been anchored as necessary to fill the desired volume of space, as illustrated at  FIG. 10F . The cartridge of cells  46  does not have to be used entirely, as the surgeon can sever a link between adjacent cells  46  so as to tailor the number of cells  46  used in a particular procedure. The severed proximal end can then be caped or sewn shut (after any further inflation performed, if necessary), or connected in fluid communication with an access port  80 . When cells are provided with valves, as described above, no further inflation should be necessary after severing. Introducer  52  is then removed from the port and the port is closed, leaving a custom designed, custom-shaped expandable member  10   em  in place, with the shape and volume being determined by the placement of the cells  46  and the number of cells  46  placed.  \\n      Implantation  \\n      As noted above, device  10  can be implanted so that, when expandable member  10   em  is expanded to an expanded configuration, expandable member  10   em  can apply compression to the stomach  120  wall, or optionally only abut or lie adjacent to the pre-prandial stomach  120  wall, without imparting any significant deformation forces thereto. However, when the patient eats and the stomach begins to fill, expandable member  10   em  in either case prevents the stomach  120  from expanding into the volume occupied by expandable member  10   em.  Thus, either the stomach is initially \u201cdeformed\u201d by device  10 , or the stomach  120  becomes \u201cdeformed\u201d as it attempts to expand and can only expand in a limited fashion, if at all, around a portion of the perimeter of expandable member  10   em.  In either case, the stomach  120  is prevented from expanding to the extent that was possible prior to implantation of device  10 .  \\n      Thus, upon expanding the one or more expandable members, the device  10  expands in the space(s) normally occupied by the stomach  120  as the stomach  120  expands when receiving food. Thus device  10  exerts pressure on, or at least prevents expansion of the fundus and optionally, the antrum and/or portions of the stomach intermediate the fundus and antrum.  \\n      As noted above, an expandable device  10  can be implanted adjacent a surface of the stomach wall, either in contact therewith or at a predetermined distance therefrom, to prevent expansion of the stomach  120  into a volume occupied by the expandable device  10 . Device  10  can be inserted, in a contracted or compressed configuration, so as to minimize the cross-sectional area of the device as it passes, through the skin of a patient, through the abdominal wall of the patient and into the abdominal cavity. This delivery may be accomplished percutaneously or laparoscopically, for example. Once in the abdominal cavity, device  10  is positioned in a space adjacent the stomach  120 , so as to fill the space and not compress the pre-prandial stomach, or alternatively to additionally provide some compression of the pre-prandial stomach, when expandable member(s) is/are expanded. As mentioned previously this positioning is to orient the device to generally follow the contours of the stomach  120  and surrounding organs, as the shape of device  10  is designed for the same.  \\n      Once properly positioned, expandable member  10   em  is expanded, either by inflation or mechanical means, or both, to occupy the desired space in the abdominal cavity.  FIGS. 3C and 3D  illustrate examples of devices  10  as properly positioned and in expanded configurations. Thus, expansion of at least one expandable member accomplishes at least one of: prevention of expansion of the stomach  120  of the patient into the space occupied by expanded device  10 ; and compression of a portion of the stomach  120  by expanded device  10 . Device  10  may be anchored to one or more structures in the abdominal cavity. For example,  FIG. 11  illustrates a device  10  having been inserted into the abdominal cavity in a manner as described, and expandable member  10 em having been inflated. Any of the devices  10 /expandable members  10 em described herein may be provided with one or more anchoring tabs  150  attached thereto. In the example shown in  FIG. 11 , anchoring tabs  150  have been bonded to the surface of expandable member  10   em,  such as with a silicone room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) adhesive, for example. Tabs  150  may also have material thereon that encourages tissue ingrowth to provide permanent fixation of tabs  150  to the anterior abdominal wall  127  or other interior abdominal structure, to fortify the fixation provided by staples, sutures, tacks or the like. Alternatively, a single tab  150  can be placed around expandable member  10 em to extend from and cover all of the areas covered by the three tabs  150  shown in  FIG. 11 . It would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other combinations of number of and shapes of tabs  150  could be substituted.  \\n      Tabs  150  are anchored to a structure (other than the stomach) in the abdominal cavity to maintain the desired positioning and orientation of device  10  relative to the stomach  120 . In  FIG. 11 , tabs  150  have been attached to the abdominal wall  127  via sutures, staples, tacks or the like  154  to fix tabs  150  with respect to the abdominal wall  127 . Port  90  is shown anchored to the opposite (external) side of the abdominal wall  127 .  \\n      Further, additionally or alternatively, a portion  156  of the surface of expandable member  10   em  that does not come into contact with stomach  120  can be roughened or provided with some porosity (wherein the porosity does not extend all the way through the wall of the expandable member  10   em ) to promote adhesion and/or tissue ingrowth for anchoring device  10 .  \\n       FIGS. 12A-12K  illustrate steps that may be carried out during a procedure for percutaneously implanting an expandable extra-gastric device  10  according to an embodiment of the present invention. Prior to making an incision, the local area (the area of the skin in and surrounding the location where the incision is to be made) may be prepared by disinfecting with alcohol and or betadine. Additionally, the patient may be given a mild sedative or may be on conscious sedation. Though not preferred, the procedure can also be carried out under general anesthesia.  \\n      Next a powerful local anesthetic such as marcaine (bupivicaine) or other powerful anesthetic, optionally mixed with an epinephrine or other vasoconstrictor to reduce any bleeding that might result from mild trauma can be injected into the local area through the skin  125  of the patient  1  down to the muscular layer and to infiltrate the fat layer and entire local area (the anesthetic portion of the mixture may not be needed if the procedure is performed under general anesthesia). Injection may be performed using a syringe  219 , as illustrated in  FIG. 12A , or other injection tool. After allowing time for the injected anesthesia to take effect, a small incision  223  is made in the skin  125  of the patient  1 , with a scalpel  229  or other surgical cutting tool, in the local area over the surgical target area where device  10  is to be implanted. Optionally, in the example shown, the incision  223  is made slightly inferior to the lower rib line  114  ( FIG. 12A  shows a frontal schematic view of the abdominal portion of the patient  1 ). Alternatively, a needle (e.g., veress needle  501 ) can be inserted, without the need to make the incision  223 , as illustrated in  FIG. 12L . A conventional veress needle does not have a lumen for a guidewire. By adding a small sheath outside the shaft of the veress needle apparatus, a modified veress needle is created such that a guidewire  502  can be easily introduced through the sheath.  FIG. 12L  further illustrate that the location of insertion in well below the xiphoid, to the left of midline, near the palpated edge of the costal cartilages. It is noted that in the alternative method illustrated in  FIG. 12A , that incision  223  can also be made in this location.  \\n       FIG. 12B  shows an access sheath or cannula  535  being inserted to guide delivery and placement of device  10  and anchoring during later steps of the procedure described below. A trocar  536  (shown in phantom lines in  FIG. 12B ) may optionally be inserted along with insertion of sheath/cannula  535  in order to facilitate formation of a pathway into which sheath/cannula  535  is inserted, and then removed from the sheath prior to insertion of any other objects such as device  10 , instruments, etc. Insertion of the sheath/cannula  535  can be performed without any additional visualization provided (i.e., just by eyesight), or may be guided by use of an endoscope  537  (shown in phantom lines) and/or with fluoroscopic visualization. If endoscope  537  is used, trocar  536  is removed after partial insertion of sheath/cannula  535  and then endoscope is inserted through sheath/cannula  535  to guide the remaining insertion to be performed, and particularly, the final placement of sheath/cannula  535 .  \\n      Once sheath/cannula  535  has been properly placed to the satisfaction of the surgeon (e.g., in one example, sheatb/cannula  535  is inserted into a region about three to four inches below the level of the inferior border of the liver  121  at or immediately to the right of midline) the same anesthetic or mixture of anesthetics used to numb the incision site prior to making the initial incision  223  can be injected into the abdomen through cannula/sheath  535  to numb the site interiorly of the abdominal wall.  \\n      Next, as shown in  FIG. 12C , a guidewire  502  is inserted through cannula/sheath  535 . Guidewire  502  may be inserted under fluoroscopic visualization, 3-D RF or electromagnetic visualization (e.g., using preexisting or real-time data sets from MRI, cat scan, three-dimensional ultrasound, or other three-dimensional data set, etc.) or blindly to pass around the stomach  120  so that it rides against the diaphragm  116  and is thereby guided along the diaphragm  116  until reaching or closely approaching the spleen  128 . Alternatively, a rod may be inserted instead of guidewire  502 , wherein the rod is stiffer than guidewire  502  and/or have variable regions of stiffness or flexibility greater than those of guidewire  502 . Additionally, the rod may have a lager cross-sectional area than guidewire  502  and optionally may have one or more lumens therethrough for delivery of suction, irrigation, injection of other fluids, injection of medicaments, etc. The rod may be inserted in similar manner to guidewire  502  by may be less likely to kink. The rod may be pre-shaped to more rigidly define a course of travel of device  10  that it guides, relative to use of the guidewire  502 , which is typically flexible. Optionally, a flexible endoscope can be inserted through cannula/sheath  535  to visualize guidewire or rod  502  and confirm that it has been properly placed.  \\n      Once properly placed, an anchoring frame  600  and an anchoring frame delivery tool  630  on which anchoring frame  600  is mounted (in a manner as described in greater detail below) are advanced over guidewire  502  and into sheath/cannula  535  (see  FIG. 12D ) after which anchoring frame delivery tool  630  is operated to deliver anchoring frame  600  into the target position along the abdominal wall, where it is anchored there. Prior to anchoring, the surgeon will check to ensure that no bowel, omentum or other tissue is located between the anchoring frame  600 /tool  630  and the abdominal wall  127 . After anchoring the anchoring frame  600  to the abdominal wall  127 , anchoring frame delivery tool is then removed from sheath/cannula  535  and off guidewire  502 .  FIG. 12E  illustrates a sectional view of the patient  1  (viewed from the feet of the patient) that shows the anchoring of anchoring frame  600  to the abdominal wall  127 , with the anchoring frame delivery tool  630  having been removed.  FIG. 12F  is a schematic illustration from a frontal view perspective, like those of  FIGS. 12A-12D , showing the anchoring frame  600  anchored in place against the abdominal wall  127 , as also shown in the sectional view of  FIG. 12E .  \\n      Once anchoring frame has been anchored to the target location, as illustrated in  FIGS. 12E and 12F , a device deployment tool  660  having already been preloaded with a device  10  in a collapsed or compressed configuration, is next advanced over the guidewire  502  and over anchoring frame  600  in a manner described in greater detail below. Positioning of the device  10  can be monitored during this delivery using fluoroscopy, X-ray, CT or MRI visualization guidance, for example, or simply via direct visualization with an endoscope, such as a flexible endoscope inserted through sheath/cannula  535 , for example. Alternatively an endoscope may be inserted into device deployment tool  660  or other tool to perform such viewing, or an endoscope can be inserted through an additional opening through the patient accessing the abdominal cavity. Device  10  is advanced to the end of anchoring frame where it automatically locks into position there.  FIG. 12G  shows a sectional illustration of device  10  having been locked into position on anchoring frame  600 , with device delivery tool  660  having been removed.  \\n      At this stage, when the surgeon is satisfied that device  10  has been properly positioned and locked to anchoring frame  600 , cannula/sheath  535  and guidewire  502  are both removed. For devices  10  that include one or more inflatable expandable members  10   em,  at least one conduit  12  will remain extending from device  10 , proximally out through the incision  223  having been made in the patient. The one or more conduits  12  can then be used to inflate the one or more expandable members. For devices that do not include an inflatable expandable member  10   em,  a conduit  12  is not necessarily required, although there may be one present, depending upon the type of mechanically expandable member(s) that is/are used. For example, a conduit may be provided to insert a wire therethrough to mechanically expand the expandable member  10 em. Otherwise, if a conduit  12  is not included, then the one or more expandable members are expanded in a manner as has already been described.  \\n      Getting back to devices  10  having at least one inflatable expandable member, one or more expandable members  10   em  may be inflated at this stage to test the amount of displacement and positioning of the device when in an expanded configuration, which may help to determine whether device  10  will perform as intended. One method of testing in this manner is with the use of an intra-gastric sizing device  310  (e.g. an intra-gastric balloon catheter) in a manner as described in application Ser. No. 11/407,701. Additionally, or alternatively, testing may be performed by visually observing the effects of expansion, such as by inputting radiopaque fluid into the stomach  120 , and/or by observing the expansion of the device when it is provided with one or more radiopaque indicators, as has already been described previously. Visualization, in such instances may be performed fluoroscopically or with other X-ray visualization, for example.  \\n       FIG. 12H  illustrates expansion of a first expandable member  10   em   1  using pressurized gas, for example. At this time, an intra-gastric sizing device may optionally be already in position, and typically is placed and inflated to the desired size prior to expanding expandable member  10   em   1 . For devices having only one expandable member  10   em,  expansion of this expandable member would then be performed to accomplish the desired amount of space restriction as indicated by feedback from intra-gastric sizing device  130 , for example. In the example shown, where two expandable members are provided, expandable member  10   em   1  is typically inflated to a predetermined pressure where it has been determined that the expandable member has not expanded or stretched to a degree where the leakage rate of gas through the member is unacceptable. Typically, a maximum pressure will have been predetermined where the leakage rate is not excessive, and expandable member  10   em   1  will not be expanded by a pressure that is greater than this maximum pressure. If the resulting degree of expansion of expandable member  10   em   1  does not provide sufficient displacement, then the second expandable member is expanded, such as by inputting pressurized liquid into expandable member  10   em   2 , to expand it until sufficient displacement has been achieved, such as confirmed by visualization and/or feedback from intra-gastric sizing device, for example, see  FIG. 12I .  \\n      At this time, conduits  12   1 ,  12   2  can be either clamped off to maintain the pressures within expandable members  10   em   1 ,  10   em   2 , or the pressures can be released, thereby allowing expandable members  10   em   1 ,  10   em   2 . It is easier procedurally to release the pressures and so this is typically done. However, the surgeon may choose to clamp off the conduits to maintain at least partial pressures in the expandable members to ensure that they maintain the observed positions. In any case, conduit(s)  12  are next trimmed to an appropriate length for connection with an adjustment member  80 , as illustrated in  FIG. 12J .  \\n      Conduit(s)  12  are then connected to a mating connector on adjustment member  80  or to a deployment tool  370  configured to mate conduit  12  with adjustment member  80 , and, after connection of conduit  12  to adjustment member  80 , adjustment member deployment tool  370  is then used to anchor adjustment member  80  to the patient. By advancing deployment tool  370  into the patient, the portion of conduit that had extended from the patient  1  is pushed back into the patient, until the adjustment member is positioned in the target location where it is intended to be anchored. This positioning can be verified using any of the previously described visualization techniques, or can be performed blindly, with feedback from palpitation, for example. In the example shown in  FIG. 12K , adjustment member  80  is anchored subcutaneously, to the external surface of the abdominal wall  127 . As has been disclosed previously, adjustment member  80  can alternatively be anchored subcutaneously, to an inner layer of the skin for example, or otherwise in the fat layer  131  without being anchored directly to the abdominal wall  127 . Once adjustment member  80  has been anchored in the desired location, deployment tool  370  is withdrawn and the one or more expandable members are reinflated, if they had been previously deflated, or topped off, if the conduits  12  were clamped to maintain some pressure, to return the one or more expandable members to their desired sizes. In this way, the patient can begin to experience beneficial weight loss from the effects of device  10  on the stomach  120  beginning immediately after completion of the procedure, unlike current procedures, which typically require around six weeks before a return visit to \u201ccomplete\u201d the procedure to make it effective in helping weight loss. The same type or types of monitoring can be used here, as described above with regard to  FIGS. 12H-12I , to provide feedback as to when the one or more expandable members have been expanded by the desired amount. Alternatively, one or more of the one or more expandable members may be left in an unexpanded configuration, with the patient being allowed to heal and then return to have the expandable members(s) inflated. Further alternatively, device  10  may be implanted in combination with a constricting band, such as the LapBand\u2122 or similar implant to improve results from such constricting band, or to make weight loss efficacious where prior implantation of such a constricting band has not been efficacious. For example, a constricting band generally useful for restricting the amount of solid food ingested by the patient  1 . However, a patient  1  may \u201ccheat\u201d the effectiveness of a constricting band approach by drinking high caloric liquids, for example. For example, a patient could drink a thirty-two ounce milkshake and this would pass right through the constriction established by the constricting band. However, with device  10  implanted and expanded as described, the stomach is preventing from expanding, even by high caloric liquids.  \\n      Once the surgeon is satisfied that the expandable member(s) have been expanded by the desired amount, or if the expandable members(s) are to be left in a contracted (unexpanded or partially expanded) state, the patient is closed, including, suturing the skin  125  at the site of the incision  223 .  \\n       FIGS. 12L-12N  illustrate variations in the percutaneous procedure described above that can be alternatively performed. As already noted above,  FIG. 12L  schematically illustrates percutaneous insertion of a guidewire through a needle  501 , wherein the incision and sheath insertion steps of  FIGS. 12A-12B  need not be carried out.  FIG. 12M  illustrates the insertion of guidewire  502  to follow the contour of the caudal surface of the diaphragm as it is pushed up and around the stomach  120 , as far as the spleen, like described in  FIG. 12C  above. The distal end of guidewire  502  may be provided in a \u201cJ\u201d shape or other bent shape to make it more atraumatic.  \\n      Once the guidewire  502  has been placed as desired, needle  501  is pulled off of guidewire  502  and removed. A port  535  (similar to a laparoscopic port or other access sheath or cannula  535  is then inserted through the opening made by needle  501 , as illustrated in  FIG. 12N . Installation of anchoring frame  600 , device  10  and access member  80  may then be performed as described above with regard to  FIGS. 12D-12K . In another variation regarding expanding expandable members  10   em,  for a device  10  having two expandable members, expandable member  10   em   1  may be expanded with gas after the access member  80  is installed/anchored, and expandable member  10   em   2  may be expanded with fluid, after completion of the procedure and some passage of time (e.g., during a follow-up visit).  \\n      Any of the variations of the procedure described above may be executed under fluoroscopic visualization, 3-dimensional navigation or other CT/MRI guidance. Further alternatively, any of these procedures may be performed as mini laparoscopic procedures (e.g., where the entire abdominal space is not insufflated, but only a small portion is and general anesthesia is not used; or where at least one of the steps involving insertion into the abdominal cavity is performed without direct visualization provided by an endoscope, for example. Anchoring of anchoring frame  600  may be performed as a separate step of the procedure, as shown and described above, or, alternatively, may be combined with the device  10  insertion and positioning part of the procedure, wherein the act of sliding the device  10  over the anchoring frame drives the anchoring of the anchoring frame  600  at the same time that device  10  is positioned (slid) thereon. All tools referenced in the above procedure may include lumens to permit insertion of other tools and/or devices therethrough, including, but not limited to: endoscopes, wires, etc. and/or to allow delivery of suction, irrigation, and/or other substances. Alternatively to mounting the adjustment member  80  to conduit  12  in any of the manners described above, adjustment member may be pre-attached or integral with conduit  12 . As already noted previously, device  10  may include one or more chambers (expandable members) and may also contain fluids, gases, structural members, foams and/or other space occupying materials.  \\n      Referring to  FIGS. 13A-13D , an embodiment of an anchoring frame  600  is illustrated that can be used for anchoring a device  10  in the abdominal space, such as, but not limited to the manner described above with regard to  FIGS. 12A-12K , for example.  FIG. 13A  illustrates a perspective view of anchoring frame in an undeployed configuration, i.e., when anchors  102  have not been deployed to anchor the anchoring frame. In the undeployed configuration, anchoring frame  600  has a contact surface  604  that is configured, shaped and dimensioned to conform to a tissue surface in the abdominal cavity to which the anchoring frame  600  is to be anchored. Openings  606  are provided that extend from an inner surface of anchoring frame, through the wall on which the contact surface  604  is formed, and through the contact surface  604 . Openings  606  are arranged for delivery of anchors  602  therethrough and are thus aligned with anchors  602  as will be described in greater detail below. Although shown as substantially straight, anchoring frame and contact surface  604  may have a curvature that is formed to follow the general contour of the structure in the abdominal cavity that it is to be anchored to. Thus, for example, for anchoring to the abdominal wall  127  in the procedure describe above, anchoring frame  600  and contact surface  604  are curved to conform to the contour of the abdominal wall  127  just below the diaphragm  116 . Thus, the curvature (or straightness) of the anchoring frame  600  and contact surface  604  is dictated by the contour of the tissue surface that it is intended to be anchored to. Thus, anchoring frame  600  can be substantially rigid and shaped with a predefined curvature (or shape) of contact surface  604  to match that of the tissue surface that it is to be anchored to. Alternatively, and preferably, anchoring frame may be flexible, so that when compressive forces are applied to it, by applying a force distally to the proximal end of anchoring frame  600 , such as with anchoring frame deployment tool  630 , for example, while the distal end of anchoring frame is fixed, such as by being abutted up against a ball end of a guidewire, for example, the compressive force causes the frame  600  and contact surface  604  to bend and thereby abut against the surface of the tissue to be anchored to. Frame  600  and surface  604  may be structurally biased so as to be predisposed to bending in one direction away from the longitudinal axis of the frame  600 , as opposed to bending in the opposite direction, to ensure that the contact surface bows out in the direction where it will contact the tissue structure to which it is to be anchored.  \\n      Within the channel  608  are positioned a series of anchors  610  such as staples, tacks, spikes or other sharpened mechanical member configured to be driven into the tissue and to maintain anchoring within the tissue after piercing it. The staples of other sharpened mechanical members are positioned in frame  600  in small channels and are completely retracted so as not to extend through surface  604  as frame  600  is being delivered into the abdominal cavity. A deployment member  612  is provided within anchoring frame  600  that is configured for deploying the anchors. Deployment member  612  includes an enlarged driver  613  located distally of anchors  10 , and a cable or wire  614  that extends proximally from drive  613  and out the proximal end of anchoring frame  600 . Cable/wire  614  has sufficient length so that when anchoring frame is placed in position on the target area in the abdominal cavity to which it is to be anchored, the proximal end portion of cable/wire  614  still extends out of the patient  1  (such as out of the incision  223  in the procedure described above, for example).  \\n      When frame  600  is positioned in the abdominal cavity at the target location where it is to be anchored, e.g., against the abdominal wall, frame  600  is held motionless against the target area while deployment member is retracted proximally. If frame  600  is a flexible frame, constant pressure is exerted in a distal direction against the frame to ensure that it remains buckled/bent against the target area, so that it conforms to and contacts the target surface (e.g., abdominal wall). By pulling on cable/wire  614  while holding frame  600  substantially motionless, deployment driver  613  is retracted proximally through channel  608 , as illustrated in  FIG. 13C . As it is retracted, driver  613  contacts anchors  610  driving them out through openings  606  and into the tissue, thereby anchoring frame  600  to the tissue as desired. Upon completely withdrawing deployment member  614 /driver  613 , and open channel  608  is then provided for guiding one or more keys provided on a device  10  that are slidable in channel and are configured to be prevented from pulling through the slot at the bottom of the channel  608 .  \\n      To further enhance anchoring of frame  600 , all of a portion of surface  604  may be covered with an ingrowth layer  616 , such as a fabric layer (e.g., polyethylene terepthalate or other porous, biocompatible fabric) or other porous layer configured to encourage tissue ingrowth.  \\n       FIG. 14A  illustrates an example of a device  10  provided with keys  618  configured to slide within channel  608  while being prevented from sliding out through slot  608   s.  Thus, keys  608  are generally matching to the cross-sectional configuration of channel  608 , while each having a neck portion  618   n  of narrower dimension that is configured to slide within slot  608   s.    FIG. 14B  shows an end view of key  618  inserted into channel  608  of frame  600 . Alternatively, key  618  need not have a cross sectional shape that matches the cross-sectional shape of channel  608 , as long as the enlarged portion of key  618  is too large to pass through slot  618   s,  yet small enough to slide within channel  608 , and neck  618   n  is of small enough dimension to slight through slot  608   s.    FIG. 14C  shows an example of a key  618  wherein the enlarged portion is spherically shaped. Keys  618  are not limited to the shapes described but can take on virtually any cross-sectional shape, as long as the requirements in size described above are met, relative to cooperating with channel  608  and slot  608   s.  Of course, some cross-sectional shapes are more advantageous than others with regard to functionality, such as minimizing resistance/friction between the keys  618  and channel  608  as device  10  is deployed over frame  600 .  \\n      The number of keys  618  attached to device  10  is also variable and may vary from one up to several dozen. Lengths of the keys (relative to the longitudinal axis of frame  600 ) can also be a variety of sizes, up to and including, a continuous key that extends over the full length of channel  608 .  FIG. 14D  illustrates the device  10  of  FIG. 14A  having been mounted on anchoring frame  600  of  FIGS. 13A-13D . Of course, during the insertion of device  10  into the abdominal cavity target area, device  10  will typically be in a compact, collapsed configuration to minimize its size during the delivery and as it is mounted on anchoring frame  600 . An exception may be in a situation where device  10  is implanted using an open procedure.  \\n       FIG. 15A  illustrates another embodiment of an anchoring frame  600  that employs a rail configuration for receiving a device thereover. Anchoring frame  600  is constructed similarly to any of the variations described above with regard to frame  600  in  FIGS. 13A-13D , including the contact surface  604 , optional ingrowth layer  616 , anchors  610 , and openings  606 . Frame  600  is installable over a removable wire, such as guidewire  502 , for example, with the wire being removable after completion of the procedure. In this arrangement, however, rather than having a channel  608  to slidably receive one or more keys  618 , rail or beam  618  functions as a key with respect to a channel or groove  608  formed in device  10  that slides over rail or beam  618 . As with the keys  618  on device  10 , the rail or beam  618  need not be T-shaped in cross-section, as shown in  FIG. 15A , as long as the enlarged portion of rail  618  is too large to pass through slot  608 s in the channel  608  of device  10 , yet small enough to slide within channel  608 , and neck  618   n  is of small enough dimension to slide through slot  608   s.  Likewise channel  608  need not be T-shaped in cross section, but may have some other cross-section shape that forms an enlarged portion to slide within channel  608  and is impassable through slot  608   s,  and a neck portion  618   n  that is slidable within slot  608   s.    \\n      In order to deploy anchors  610  into the tissue to anchor the anchoring frame  600  of  FIG. 15A , deployment member  612  in this case is provided to slide over rail  618  as illustrated in the end view of  FIG. 15B  (anchors  610  are not shown, for simplicity of illustration, since the mechanism for driving the anchors  610  by driver  613  is the same as that described with regard to  FIG. 13B  above). Deployment member  612  includes an enlarged driver  613  that is located in the channels formed on both sides of neck  616 n that is located distally of anchors  610 , prior to deployment, and a cable or wire  614  that extends proximally from driver  613  and out the proximal end of anchoring frame  600 . Cable/wire  614  has sufficient length so that when anchoring frame is placed in position on the target area in the abdominal cavity to which it is to be anchored, the proximal end portion of cable/wire  614  still extends out of the patient  1  (such as out of the incision  223  in the procedure described above, for example).  \\n      When frame  600  is positioned in the abdominal cavity at the target location where it is to be anchored, e.g., against the abdominal wall, frame  600  is held motionless against the target area while deployment member is retracted proximally. If frame  600  is a flexible frame, constant pressure is exerted in a distal direction against the frame to ensure that it remains buckled/bent against the target area, so that it conforms to and contacts the target surface (e.g., abdominal wall). By pulling on cable/wire  614  while holding frame  600  substantially motionless, deployment driver  613  is retracted proximally to slide along rail  618 . As it is retracted, driver  613  contacts anchors  610  on both sides of neck  618   n,  thereby driving them out through openings  606  and into the tissue, thereby anchoring frame  600  to the tissue as desired. Upon completely withdrawing deployment member  614 /driver  613 , rail is then unobscured by driver  613 , so that the channel  608  of device  10  can be slid thereover.  \\n       FIG. 15C  shows an end view of device  10  having one configuration (T-shaped cross-section) of channel  608  configured to slide over rail  618  to secure device  10  to anchoring frame  600 .  FIG. 15D  shows device  10  of  FIG. 15C  having been mounted on anchoring frame  600  of  FIGS. 15A-15B . Note that channel  608  can extend over a length of device  10  that is much greater than the length of frame  600 , to provide guidance of delivery of the distal end of the device, even though the distal end of device  10  is not engaged with frame  600  when device  10  has been installed in the intended position as shown in  FIG. 15D .  \\n       FIG. 15E  is a schematic, sectional illustration (viewed from the foot of the patient with the patient lying on his back) of device  10  anchored to the abdominal wall  127  via anchoring frame  600 , with device  10  shown in an expanded configuration.  \\n       FIG. 16A  illustrates an embodiment of an anchoring frame  600  that includes an actuation mechanism that can be use to anchor the frame  600  to tissue (deploy) as well as to release the frame  600  from such anchoring. In this case, deployment member  612  is provided in a channel  608  above a rail  618  that is configured to receive device  10  thereover, and deployment member  612  is configured to not only anchor the frame  600  to a tissue surface, but is also operable to reverse this anchoring, so as to allow removal or repositioning and re-anchoring of frame  600 . Thus, the enlarged members or drivers  613  of deployment member  612  include deployment driver surfaces  613   a  and retraction driver surfaces  613   b  as illustrated in  FIG. 16A . Upon sliding deployment member  612  relative to frame  600  in a direction to contact deployment driver surfaces  613   a  with anchors  610  (i.e., to the left, as shown in  FIG. 16A ) and continuing to slide deployment member  612  in that direction, deployment driver surfaces  613   a  drive anchors to rotate so as to extend the sharp (distal) ends of anchors out of openings  606 , as illustrated in  FIG. 16B . Deployment driver surfaces  613   a  are abrupt or steep and may even be formed as substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of frame  600 . Retraction driver surfaces  613   b  are ramped or cammed so as to allow the rotation of the opposite (proximal) ends down into channel  608  without contacting deployment member  612  during deployment of the distal ends.  \\n      Thus,  FIG. 16B  illustrates anchors  610  in the deployed configuration, wherein, when contact surface  604  is contacted to a tissue surface and anchors  610  are deployed in this manner, this anchors frame  600  to the tissue. Should the operator wish to remove anchoring frame  600 , or reposition it, deployment member  612  is slid in the opposite direction relative to frame  600  (i.e., to the right in  FIG. 16B ). This causes retraction driver surfaces to contact the proximal ends  610   p  of anchors  610 , and continued movement of deployment member  612  causes drivers  613   p  to reverse rotate anchors  610  to the positions shown in  FIG. 16A . These deployment and retraction functions are repeatable. That is, after retracting the anchors  610  as described, anchoring frame can be repositioned on a tissue surface, and deployment member  612  can be actuated again to deploy anchors  610  and thereby anchor the frame  600  to the new location.  \\n       FIG. 16C  illustrates a tool  625  configured to engage with deployment member  612  and anchoring frame  600  and, when engaged, can be used to move, orient and position anchoring frame, as well as operate deployment member  612  to deploy anchors  610  and/or retract anchors  610 . Tool  625  includes an elongated shaft  627  having sufficient length so that when tool  625  is engaged with anchoring frame  600  and deployment member  612  in a manner as described hereafter, a proximal end portion of tool  625 , including actuators to be manipulated by a surgeon or other user, extend out of the body of the patient  1 , even when frame  600  has been inserted into the abdominal cavity as far as it needs to be advanced to anchor it at a desired location. The distal end of tool  625  includes a quick release mechanism  628  configured to engage with engagement features  615  on a proximal end portion of anchoring frame  600 . For example, quick release mechanism  628  may include a plurality of hooks or teeth  628   h  that engage with engagement features  615  provided as mating or interengaging hooks to teeth. The hooks or teeth  628   h  can be drawn toward one another, radially inwardly, such as by rotation of quick release actuator  629 , for example, so that they no longer engage with engagement members  615 , but can be slid therepast, quickly releasing tool  625  from anchoring frame  600 .  \\n      A cam driver  629  is formed at a distal end of a cam driver shaft  629 d that is axially drivable with respect to shaft  627  by pivoting cam driver actuator  631  relative to shaft  627 . A slidable safety lock  633  may be provided on shaft  627  that is slidable in a first direction to prevent pivoting of actuator  631  relative to shaft  627 , thereby preventing inadvertent deployment or retraction of anchors  610  when cam driver  629  of tool  625  is engaged with deployment member  612 , such as by engagement with cam driver engagement member  612   c,  for example. By sliding safety lock  633  in the opposite direction, this unlocks actuator  631  and the operator can then either pivot actuator  631  toward shaft  627  to drive deployment member  612  to deploy anchors  610 , or pivot actuator  631  away from shaft  627  to retract anchors into anchoring frame  600 . Upon quick release of tool  625  from frame  600  as described, cam driver  629  can be released from cam drive engagement member  612 c by simply rotating tool  625  about its longitudinal axis so that cam driver  629  and engagement member  612   c  become misaligned.  \\n       FIG. 17  illustrates an anchoring frame deployment tool  630  that can be used for percutaneous delivery of anchoring frame  600 . Tool  630  includes a handle  632  for manual operation by a user (e.g., surgeon) and an elongated, rigid shaft  634  extending distally therefrom. An engagement feature  636  is provided on shaft  636  for engaging with anchoring frame and securing it during the delivery thereof. For example, engagement feature may be a rail, e.g., a t-shaped rail or other cross sectional configuration that slides within a channel in frame  600 , somewhat like a tongue-and-groove fitting, or may include a channel that slides over a rail portion of frame  600 , etc. An actuator  638  is provided on handle  632  that is actuatable to trigger staples or other mechanical members  610  to be driven through the openings in frame  600  to extend through the surface  604  and into the target internal abdominal structure (e.g., abdominal wall) to anchor frame  600  thereto. One or more lumens may be provided through shaft  634  for delivery of irrigating fluids (or other substances) and for application of suction to the distal end of shaft  634 , via ports  640  and  642 , respectively.  \\n       FIG. 18A  illustrates another embodiment of an anchoring frame deployment tool  630  that is configured to receive an endoscope  537  therein to facilitate viewing of the placement of anchoring frame  600 . A video camera  538  may be provided on endoscope  537  so as to monitor the visualization on a screen, or, optionally, viewing may be performed directly through an ocular.  \\n      Shaft  634  articulates, via one or more articulating joints  644 . An articulation actuator  646  is provided on or near handle  630  for operation by a user to control the articulation of a distal portion  634   d  of shaft  634  with respect to a proximal portion  634   p  of shaft  634 . In the example shown, articulation actuator  646  is a rotatable wheel that is rotatable in a first direction to articulate distal portion  634   d  in a first angular direction about joint  644 , while rotation of actuator  646  in the opposite direction articulates distal portion  634   d  in the opposite direction. Articulation actuator  646  and/or articulation joint  644  provide frictional resistance, so that when actuator  646  is not being rotated, distal portion  634   d  is maintained in its orientation relative to proximal portion  634   p.    \\n      A window or opening  648  is provided proximally of articulating joint  644  to enable viewing through the distal end of endoscope  537  that is positioned in shaft  634  at the location of opening/window  648  when endoscope  537  is inserted into tool  630 . Window/opening  648  may be an opening (e.g., cutout), or may be a window, e.g., a cutout that is sealed over with a transparent material.  \\n      Distal portion  634   d  includes a recess or cavity  650  configured to receive anchoring frame  600  therein. Thus, recess or cavity  650  is shaped and dimensioned to receive anchoring frame  600  therein and to confine anchoring frame  600  from movements axially with respect to the longitudinal axis of distal portion  634 d. Frame  600  may be received in recess, cavity or slot  650  by friction fit and/or a releasable clamping mechanism (not shown, see co-pending Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3,  FIGS. 36A-36D  and description thereof)) may be optionally provided on opposite sides of slot, recess or cavity  650  for releasably clamping frame  600  wherein it is received therein, with clamping and releasing motions being controlled by a clamp actuator (not shown, see co-pending Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3,  FIGS. 36A-36D  and description thereof)). Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3) is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto.  FIG. 18B  shows an enlarged partial view of shaft  634  with anchoring frame  600  mounted within distal end portion  634   d,  and showing the distal end of endoscope  537  within proximal end portion  634   p.    \\n      In use, after insertion and placement of guidewire  502 , such as in a percutaneous procedure as described above, deployment tool  630  is passed over guidewire  502 , with the proximal end of guidewire first being inserted into the distal end of shaft  634 , through shaft  634  and handle  632  and proximally out of handle  632 , as illustrated in  FIG. 18A . By insertion of tool  630  into the abdominal cavity, the abdominal wall (e.g., the anterior abdominal wall can be directly visualized by endoscope  537 /camera  538  viewing through opening/window  648 . This visualization is performed to ensure that that is no tissue located between the anchoring site (e.g., anterior abdominal wall  127 ) and anchoring frame  600  prior to anchoring the frame  600  to the anchoring site. Once it has been visually confirmed that there is no tissue intervening between frame  600  and the anchoring site, actuator  646  is manipulated to rotate distal portion  634   d  up against the anchoring site, thereby contacting surface  604  to the anchoring site. Anchors  610  are then deployed into the anchoring site, such as by a mechanism described above for example. In an alternative embodiment, needles and sutures may be substituted for anchors  610 , such as described in Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3,  FIG. 36C  and description thereof). A deployment actuator  652 , such as a trigger, lever or other equivalent mechanical actuator can be provided on handle  632  for operation by the user. Thus when actuator  652  ( FIG. 18A ) is actuated, this retracts enlarged member  613  to drive anchors  610  into the tissue, thereby anchoring the frame  600 . Deployment actuator may be provided with a safety mechanism or lock  654  that can be locked up until the time that the operator is ready to deploy the anchors  610 , to prevent inadvertent deployment of anchors  610  before the frame  600  has been properly positioned and is ready to be anchored.  \\n      When device  10  has been fully inserted into its intended position relative to anchoring frame  600 , device is locked into this position by automatic lock  620 .  FIGS. 19A-19B  show one embodiment of an automatic lock  620  that may be provided on the proximal end of frame  600  on the underside of the top portion of track  618 .  FIGS. 19A and 19B  show partial views of anchoring frame  600  with anchors  610  not being shown for simplicity of illustration. In  FIG. 19A , locks  620  are shown deployed. Locks  220  may be spring steel or some other biased members that are biased toward the deployed configuration shown in  FIG. 19A , while being deformable so as to lie substantially parallel or flush with the underside. Thus, when the channel  608  rides over the enlarged portion  618  at the bottom of the rail, in this case in a tongue and groove type of interfit, the top surfaces on opposite sides of slot  608  contact the undersurface  618   u  of the top portion of the frame  600  and are guide therealong. As the top surfaces ride over automatic locks  620 , they depress them towards the undersurface so that the device is able to slide along the rail. Once the entire channel  608  of device  10  has passed locks  620  (distally thereof), locks resiliently spring back into the conformation shown in  FIG. 19A , thereby preventing device  10  from being retracted proximally back off of frame  600 . Detents and/or other stopping structure (not shown) are provided at the distal end portion of the frame  600  to prevent channel  608  from being slid too far distally with respect to anchoring frame  600 /enlarged portion  618 .  \\n      Prior to anchoring the frame  600  to the desired target tissue, automatic locks are held recessed (in an unlocked configuration) against the undersurface  618 . This is necessary to allow the retraction of the enlarged member  613  of deployment member  612  during deployment of anchors  610 . For example, lock prevention tabs  622  may be inserted in slots  624  to maintain a biasing force on locks  620  to keep them in the unlocked configuration. Tabs  622  may be integrated, such as to form a U-shaped member like shown in  FIG. 19B  and a wire or suture  626  extends proximally therefrom and has a length sufficient to extend out of the patient  1 , even when frame  600  is located in its intended anchoring position. After enlarged member  613  has been retracted through frame  600  to drive anchors  610  into the target tissue, in a manner as already described above, and deployment member  612 /enlarged member  613  has been removed from anchoring frame  600 , the operator pulls on wire/suture  626 , thereby sliding tabs  622  out of their respective positions and removing tabs  622  form anchoring frame  600 . Upon this removal, locks  620  resiliently spring back into the locked configuration shown in  FIG. 19A .  \\n       FIG. 20A  shows an anchoring frame unlocking tool  670 , that can be used to unlock the anchoring frame to free device  10  that has been automatically locked into position along anchoring frame  600 . For example, it may be difficult to remove frame  600  if tissue has ingrown into tissue ingrowth surfaces provided on surface  604 , so this removal mechanism makes it much easier to remove the expandable member(s)  10   em  for replacement, or withdrawal if no longer indicated. Tool  670  includes a handle  672 , and elongated shaft  674  and a lock depressor  676  at the distal end of shaft  674 . Lock depressor  676  is configured to be mounted and slide over rail  618  and includes depressor portions  676   d  that extend above the portion that fits over rail  618  and that press against automatic locks  620  to depress them to the unlocked configuration as depressor  676  is slid over the rail  618 .  FIG. 20B  shows an end view of tool  670  that illustrates a configuration of a lock depressor  676  according to one embodiment. Optionally, an actuator  678  may be provided to actuate the depressor portions form a retracted configuration to the extended configuration shown in  FIG. 20B .  \\n       FIG. 20C  schematically illustrates use of tool  670  to unlock device  10  from anchoring frame  600  so that device  10  can be removed from the site. Tool  670  is inserted (e.g., through incision  233  in the percutaneous procedures described above, or along any other approach provided by other procedures, such as mini-laparoscopic, laparoscopic, open, etc.) and lock depressor  676  is mounted over rail  618 . Tool  670  is then distally advanced over rail  618 . As lock depressor  676  advances distally, it depresses the automatic locks  620 , as shown. Upon full depression of locks  620 , or simply by distally advancing tool  670  until lock depressor  676  contacts the proximal end of channel  608  of the device  10 , device  10  is now ready to be removed off of frame  600 . By applying retraction force to conduit  12 , channel  608  slides proximally over channel  618 , thereby withdrawing device  10  and tool  670  together. Tool  670  may be operated to maintain contact with the proximal end of channel  608  to ensure that locks  620  remain unlocked as channel  608  is withdrawn thereover. In an alternate method, locks  620  may be formed with thin enough material so that an impulsive tug on conduit  12  is sufficient to bend locks  620  over backwards to allow channel  608  (and thus device  10 ) to be withdrawn off of frame  600 .  \\n      As noted above, device  10  is provided in a compact (non-expanded) configuration during delivery, at least when delivering by a percutaneous, mini-laparoscopic or laparoscopic procedure.  FIG. 21A  illustrates an embodiment of device  10  provided with looped tabs  682 , with one set  682   a  extending lengthwise (e.g. relatively aligned along channel  608 ) on one side of expandable member  10   em,  and an alternating set  60   8   b  on the opposite side of the expandable member  10   em.  With expandable member in a deflated configuration, expandable member can be rolled in the direction indicated by arrows in  FIG. 21A  about its longitudinal axis, so that the expandable member  10   em  is rolled up on itself to form a compact structure resembling a cylinder. Once rolled up into this configuration, looped tabs  682   a  and  682   b  align with each other and a rod or wire  684  can be inserted through the loops of looped tabs  682   a,   682   b  to maintain device  10  in the rolled up configuration, as shown in  FIG. 21B . It is noted that channel  608  is still exposed on an external surface of the device even when in the rolled up condition, so that it can be mounted and slid over rail  618  during the delivery of device  10 . Once device  10  has been positioned over frame  600 /rail  618  in the desired location, wire  684 , which has sufficient length to extend out of the patient even when device  10  is mounted in the intended position on frame  600 , can be withdrawn by an operator, thereby freeing the expandable member. Upon inputting of gas and/or liquid to expandable member  10   em,  it unfurls and assumes its expanded configuration. Although devices that are attached by an anchoring frame  600  typically will not require further anchoring, it is noted that such procedures are not limited to anchoring using only the anchoring frame, as any of the other attachment or anchoring techniques and features may optionally be used in addition to anchoring with an anchoring frame  600 . In this regard, it is noted that looped tabs  682  may be used as attachment areas, e.g., through which sutures, staples or tacks, etc. may be driven to further attach device  10  to the patient. Still further, whether or not used to attach device  10 , looped tabs also provide convenient and safe areas for manipulation by the use of tools, such as graspers, etc. It is further noted that this type of compaction feature can be provided for devices that are not attached to an anchoring frame  600 , but are attached by other means described herein, or are attached only by attaching tabs  682  to tissues within the patient.  \\n      Alternatively, an expandable compaction member  686  may be provided to surround and compact expandable member  10   em  for delivery thereof as illustrated in  FIGS. 21C-21D . For example, expandable compaction member  686  may be a thermoformed balloon that is formed to roll up when inflated, but can be opened up or spread apart or held open in a relatively flattened out configuration in its non-expanded (deflated) state as illustrated in  FIG. 21C . This open configuration allows a rolled up or otherwise compressed expandable member to be placed on expandable compaction member  686 . Expandable compaction member  686  is then inflated/expanded via conduit  686   i,  whereupon it assumes it rolled-up configuration, thereby substantially surrounding the compacted expandable member  10   em  as illustrated in the end view of  FIG. 21D . In this configuration, the expandable member  10   em  and compaction member  686  are deliverable into the abdominal cavity for location at the intended surgical target site.  \\n      Once in the intended surgical target site, i.e., in the location where it is desired to expand the expandable member  10   em,  compaction member  686  may then be deflated and then withdrawn from its encapsulation of expandable member  10   em  and from the abdominal cavity. Optionally, expandable member may first be attached to a rail or to some other fixation point to prevent it from being withdrawn as compaction member  686  is withdrawn. After removal of compaction member  686 , expandable member  10   em  can be expanded in the course of a procedure as described with regard to any of the embodiments described herein or in any of the disclosures for which priority has been relied upon.  \\n       FIG. 21E  illustrates another embodiment in which a rigid exoskeleton  688  is provided to receive expandable member  10   em  and maintain it in a compressed or otherwise non-expanded configuration for delivery into the surgical target area. For example, exoskeleton may be in the form of a rigid canister as illustrated in  FIG. 21E , that functions similar to a film canister for 35 mm film. That is, expandable member  10   em  can be rolled up or otherwise inserted into canister  688  to be retained therein in a non-expanded state. Typically, at least an edge of the expandable member  10   em  will be left slightly protruding from the opening or slot  68   8   s  provided in exoskeleton  688 . In the example shown in  FIG. 21E , the edge of expandable member  10   em  protruding from opening  688   s  includes tabs  682 , looped tabs  682   a  or other features for engaging with a rail or other anchored structure in the abdominal cavity  682 . In the case of looped tabs  682 , of other feature for engaging a rail or other fixed structure, these features can be looped over or otherwise engage with the fixed structure in the abdominal cavity when the exoskeleton containing the compressed or otherwise non-expanded expandable member is inserted into the surgical target location in the abdominal cavity. Upon fixing the looped tabs  682   a  or other feature to the rail or other fixed structure, expandable member  10   em  can then be extracted from exoskeleton  688  by rotating exoskeleton  688  in a rotational direction opposite to the direction of the arrows shown in  FIG. 21E . This causes extraction of the expandable member  10   em  out of the exoskeleton  688  as illustrated by the directional arrows shown in  FIG. 21E . Rotation can be effected by a rod or wire  689  that is fixed to a proximal end portion of exoskeleton  688  and which may be rigid or flexible, but is torsionally rigid in either case. Alternatively, rigid exoskeleton  688  can be retracted in a linear direction opposite the directional arrows shown in  FIG. 21E . This motion, applied against the force provided by the fixation of expandable member  10   em  relative to at least one fixed structure in the abdominal cavity, cause extraction of expandable member  10   em  out of rigid exoskeleton  688  as rigid exoskeleton  688  moves away from the fixed/anchored portion of expandable member  10   em.    \\n      If tabs  682  are provided on the edge of expandable member  10   em,  one or more of tabs  682  may be temporarily or permanently anchored to a structure in the abdominal cavity, e.g., by suturing, stapling, tacking and/or adhesives or other alternative fixing members or substances, and then an unrolling motion like that described above can be carried out to extract the expandable member  10   em.  Alternatively, or if no additional features are present on the edge of the expandable member  10   em,  one or more tabs  682  or the edge of the expandable member  10   em  can be grasped, by graspers, or other long slender tool and then exoskeleton  688  can be rotated as described. In any of the procedures described above, once expandable member  10   em  has been completely extracted from exoskeleton  688 , exoskeleton  688  is withdrawn out of the patient to provide working space for continuing procedures to implant device  10 .  \\n       FIG. 21F  shows still another alternative configuration for placing expandable member  10   em  in a compacted or collapsed configuration for delivery into the abdominal cavity to the surgical target area. In this example, expandable member is folded into an accordion-fold configuration so that the expandable member is folded over on itself along folds  687 , similar to the way that a bicycle tube is packaged for sale. In this folded configuration, expandable member  10   em  can be received in an exoskeleton  688  such as described above, or can be delivered via a sheath, for example. Additionally or alternatively, expandable member  10   em  can be temporarily retained in the folded configuration by attaching the adjacent pleats or folds together using weak adhesive bonds that are broken when expandable member  10   em  is expanded, by the force of the inflation fluid pressure, for example.  \\n      In another embodiment, expandable member  10   em  may be compressed in a capsule  692  that is formed of a water soluble gel or skin  692   s  as illustrated in  FIG. 21G . In this case, the compressed expandable member  10   em  is inserted into the abdominal cavity and to the surgical target area location while soluble skin  692   s  maintains expandable member  10   em  compacted. As capsule  692  enters the aqueous environment of the abdominal cavity, skin  692   s  begins to dissolve. After a predetermined amount of time in the aqueous environment of the abdominal cavity, skin  692  has dissolved by a sufficient amount such that the input of expansion media into expandable member  10   em  causes expandable member  10   em  to expand with sufficient force to rupture capsule  692  if is has not dissolved to the extent where it has ruptured simply by dissolution. In either case, capsule  692  can be retracted out of the patient, using graspers, for example, but need not be, as it will completely dissolve with the passage of additional time.  \\n       FIG. 21H  illustrates an embodiment having a flexible, expandable exoskeleton  694 . In this example, expandable member  10   em  is surrounded by expandable exoskeleton  694 , which may be a pleated silicone capsule (or balloon), for example, or partially slitted silicone capsule or balloon, or may have either of these structures and be formed from polyurethane or other biocompatible elastomer, for example. Exoskeleton  694  is formed so that it maintains the compacted configuration shown in  FIG. 21H  as long as expandable member  10   em  does not contain an expansion medium or fluid. After placement of the exoskeleton  694  containing expandable member  10   em  at the desired surgical target site, exoskeleton  694  is inflated by inputting expansion medium (e.g., gas or liquid) through a lumen in conduit  12 , and expansion medium is inputted through another lumen in conduit  12  causing expansion of expandable member  10   em.  Alternatively, expansion medium inputted through conduit  12  to expandable member  10   em  can expand both expandable member  10   em  and exoskeleton  694  simultaneously, with the pleats or slits assisting the expansion. Exoskeleton  694  may be provided with one or more tabs  682  that can be used to anchor the exoskeleton  694  in the expanded configuration, and this may also help to maintain expandable member  10   em  in the desired expanded volume, as exoskeleton  694  supports some of the load applied to device  10  caused by expansion of the device against the structures in the abdominal cavity.  \\n       FIGS. 21I-21J  illustrate an expandable member  10   em  that is formed in an elongated tube configuration. This tube formation allows expandable member  10   em  to be linearly deployed through a small opening in a patient (or alternatively, may be used in an open surgical procedure). Tabs  682  are provided at spaced locations along the elongated tube, and act as fixation or anchoring points along the expandable member  10   em.  Thus, portions of the expandable member  10   em  can be anchored as they are inserted into and arrive at the surgical target area, such as by stapling, suturing, tacking, etc., tabs  682  to fixed structures within the abdominal cavity. In this way, elongated member can be laid out and fixed at the surgical target array in an almost infinite number of different configurations that are customizable according to the way that the user bends and fixes the portions of the expandable member. In the example shown in  FIG. 21J , expandable member has been fixed in a serpentine configuration, but this embodiment in is in no way limited to this configuration, as a coiled configuration could be provided, or groups or bunches of portions could be configured, or many other customizable configuration can be fixed, including a more or less random distribution of the portions fixed to structures in the abdominal cavity.  \\n       FIG. 21K  illustrates an alternative to the use of tabs  682  in the embodiment of  FIGS. 21I-21J . In this case, a flange  682 F is provided along one or more continuous lengths of expandable member  10   em,  up to the full length of the expandable member  10   em,  to increase the flexibility of the choice of fixation points, since stapling, tacking or suturing can be performed anywhere along the one or more flanges  682 F. It is noted that this alternative feature is not limited to the elongated tubular form of an expandable member, as one or more flanges  682  may be provided along any of the expandable members  10   em  described herein.  \\n      In another embodiment, device  10  is compacted and maintained in a compact configuration by insertion within a sheath  690  as illustrated in  FIG. 22A . Sheath  690  does not completely encircle expandable member  10   em,  but includes a slit through which a rail or channel connected to expandable member  10   em,  and which is to be connected to frame  600 , is exposed. Device  10  can be compacted into a compressed form using any of a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to: rolling (like described above, but wherein looped tabs  682  are not required), accordion folding (like a bicycle inner tube when it is first purchased), tongue rolled (described in further detail below), randomly compressed by drawing and maintaining a vacuum on expandable member(s)  10   em,  or other folding and compressing.  \\n       FIG. 22B  illustrates an expandable member  10   em  of device  10  being deployed via an introducer  696  having a splittable introducer housing at a distal end portion thereof. In the example shown, the distal end portion of introducer is split into two portions or jaws  696 J that are pivotably mounted for rotation with respect to the remainder of the introducer  696 , for example, via pivot joint  696 P. However, it is noted that the distal end portion may be splittable into three or more component jaws  696 P, as this embodiment is not limited to splitting using only two jaws  696 P. It is further noted that jaws  696 J do not have to form equal portions of the distal end of introducer  696  as shown.  FIG. 22B  shows expandable member  10   em  in a substantially flattened, non-expanded configuration, prior to further compacting it by rolling, accordion-folding, or otherwise further compacting the expandable member  10   em /device  10  to be received in the splittable jaws  696 J of introducer  696 , that form a housing for the compacted expandable member  10   em  for delivery into the abdominal cavity. A structure referred to as a \u201cdoghouse\u201d surrounds the conduit  12  where it connects to expandable member  10   em  and may form a socket into which conduit  12  is received. In any case, the doghouse strengthens the joint between conduit  12  and expandable member  10   em,  to minimize risk of failure at the joint. The doghouse may be made from the same material as conduit  12  and/or expandable member  10   em.  Conduit  12  extends trough the tube of the introducer  696  and out of a proximal end portion thereof when device  10  is loaded in the introducer  696 .  \\n       FIG. 22C  illustrates the compacted device  10  (including expandable member  10   em ) having been received in the introducer  696 , with the splittable jaws  696 J having been closed around the compacted expandable member  10   em  to maintain it in a compact configuration as it is delivered through opening  223  and through an opening formed in the abdominal muscle  127  for a percutaneous implantation procedure.  \\n      Once jaws  696 J have completely passed through the opening in the abdominal muscle  127  and have been placed in the abdominal cavity in the vicinity of the desired location for placement of expandable member  10   em,  jaws  696 J are opened by manipulation of tethers  696 T extending through introducer  696  and out of a proximal end thereof for manipulation by a user. Tethers  696 T, although provided as a pair of tethers at the proximal end of the introducer  696  and connected at the distal ends to a rod or roller  697  around which expandable member  10   em  has been rolled up in this example. Alternatively, tethers  696 T can be formed as one continuous tether  696 T having two proximal ends extending out of the proximal end portion of introducer  696  and around which expandable member  10   em  is rolled or folded at a distal end portion thereof. Upon applying tension to tethers  696 T when the operator/user pulls on the proximal end portions of tethers  696 T extending proximally from introducer  696  while maintaining the introducer  696  in a fixed position relative to the abdominal muscle  696 , this rotates the compacted expandable member  10   em  (and roller  697 , when present) as illustrated in  FIG. 22D , thereby also opening jaws  696 J. Alternatively, jaws  696 J may operate like laparoscopic graspers to open and close and are therefore opened first before applying tension on tethers  696 T to extract device  10  in a manner described above.  \\n      When device  10  has been properly oriented with respect to introducer  696 , as illustrated in  FIG. 22E , one or more tabs  682  may be fixed to a structure in the abdominal cavity, and expandable member  10   em  can then be extracted from its compact configuration, such as by unrolling (in the embodiment shown) unfolding, or otherwise extracting the expandable member from the compact state it assumed to be received in the introducer  696 , by withdrawing the introducer  696  as the distal end of expandable member is retained by the fixation. Alternatively, graspers or other instrument may be used to grasp a distal most tab or a distal portion of expandable member  10   em  to hold it relatively motionless as introducer  696  is retracted and thus drawn away from device  10 , thereby extracting expandable member  10   em,  as the proximal ends of jaws  696  are retracted back into the opening through the abdominal muscle, this closes the jaws, allowing them to be completely removed from the abdominal cavity, taking tethers  696 T (and optionally roller  697 , if present) along with it. It should be noted that although device  10  is shown positioned substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of introducer  696  as the desired orientation of the device  10  for extracting expandable member  10   em,  that this embodiment is not limited to this orientation. For example, a rolled up expandable member, as shown, may be oriented at an acute angle (in either direction) to the perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of introducer  696 , depending upon various factors, such as the available working space, desired final orientation of the expandable member  10   em,  etc. Also, tabs  682 , flange  682 F or other attachment features can be anchored to structures within the abdominal cavity in an incremental fashion, as expandable member  10   em  can be incrementally extracted, a portion at a time, with anchoring being performed between incremental extraction steps.  \\n       FIGS. 22F-22H  illustrate operation of another delivery tool for use in delivering and facilitation of anchoring of device  10  in the abdominal cavity. This tool also advantageously provides the ability to deliver device  10  by a percutaneous procedure or laparoscopic procedure. Of course, this tool can also be used in open procedures. The tool includes an inner sheath/delivery shaft  696   i  about which expandable member  10   em  can be rolled. In the example illustrated in  FIG. 22G , expandable member  10   em  has been folded over and then rolled up around the distal end portion of inner sheath/delivery shaft  696   i.  A portion of delivery shaft/inner sheath  696   i  proximal of the portion about which expandable member  10   em  is rolled, may be formed in a bend  696   b  as shown in  FIG. 22G . Inner sheath/delivery shaft  696   i  may be formed to have the bend  696   b  as shown in  FIG. 22G , when in an unbiased configuration, but is flexible so that inner sheath/delivery shaft  696   i  can be biased into a substantially straight configuration. Alternatively, bend  696   b  may be formed as a pivoted or hinged joint, which can be operated upon retraction of outer sheath  696   o  therefrom.  \\n      As shown in  FIG. 22F , an outer sheath  696   o  is provided that slides freely over inner sheath  696   i.  After compacting expandable member  10   em,  such as by rolling it around the distal end portion of inner sheath  696   i,  the distal end portion of inner sheath  696   i  is biased to substantially straighten inner sheath  696   i,  and outer sheath  696   o  is slid distally over inner sheath  6961  to cover the expandable member  10   em  and maintain it in a compact or compressed configuration as shown in  FIG. 22F . The tool and device  10  as shown in  FIG. 22F  are then ready for use. The distal end containing device  10 /expandable member  10   em  is inserted into the abdominal cavity, such as by delivery though a percutaneous or laparoscopic opening, for example. One in the vicinity of the intended implantation site (surgical target location), outer sheath  696   o  can be retracted relative to inner sheath  696   i.  As outer sheath  696   o  is retracted to the extent that bend  696   b  is no longer covered, inner sheath  696   i  returns to its unbiased, bent configuration, as illustrated in  FIG. 22G . At this time, the distal end portion of expandable member  10   em,  and typically at least one attachment tab  682  (or attachment flange  682 F, as shown in  FIG. 22G ) are presented and the distal end portion of expandable member  10   em  can be sutured, stapled, tacked, etc. to an internal structure in the abdominal cavity. By incrementally retracting inner sheath  696   i,  incremental portions of expandable member  10   em  can be extracted (e.g., unrolled and/or unfolded) with fixation of these portions being accomplished between the incremental extraction steps. Alternatively, expandable member  10   em  can be nearly fully extracted or fully extracted after just the first fixation of the distal end portion has been accomplished, or even without any anchoring of tabs  682 / 682 F if the surgeon desired to just grasp the distal end portion of expandable member  10   em  with graspers or other temporary fixation tool as inner sheath  696   i  is retracted.  FIG. 22H  illustrates the expandable member when is has been almost completely extracted.  \\n       FIGS. 22I-22K  illustrate operation of another delivery tool for use in delivering and facilitation of anchoring of device  10  in the abdominal cavity. This tool also advantageously provides the ability to deliver device  10  by a percutaneous procedure or laparoscopic procedure. Of course, this tool can also be used in open procedures. The tool in this embodiment includes an introducer that comprises a rigid, closed-ended (at the proximal end) sheath or tube  696  that houses the expandable member  10   em  during delivery thereof, as illustrated in  FIG. 22K . An attachment tab  682  or other distal portion of expandable member  10   em  may be left extending distally from sheath  696  after expandable member  10   em  is loaded into sheath  696  for delivery thereof, as shown in  FIG. 22K . This facilitates grasping of the distal portion and/or anchoring thereof to a structure in the abdominal cavity, as described below.  \\n      Expandable member  10   em,  in a non-expanded or deflated state is substantially flattened and then rolled from both side edges ( FIG. 221 ) toward a central axis, to form what is referred to as a \u201ctongue-roll\u201d configuration, as illustrated in  FIG. 22J . By rolling up expandable member  10   em  from both side edges, this avoid twisting of lumen  12  which is located substantially in alignment with the central axis of expandable member  10   em  in this case. The tongue-rolled expandable member  10   em  is then inserted into the open distal end of introducer  696  and slid into the sheath  696  of the introducer until configured as shown in  FIG. 22K . In the example shown, lumen  12  is short and does not extend much (if at all) past the edge of expandable member  10   em.  In cases where lumen  12  is longer, lumen  12  can extend alongside the tongue-rolled expandable member  10   em  to extend out of the distal end opening of sheath  696  and then bend back to run along the length of introducer sheath  696  so that a proximal end of lumen  12  extends out of the body with the proximal end of sheath  696  as expandable member is placed in the abdominal cavity.  \\n      Since the introducer comprises a rigid sheath  696 , it can be used to perform blunt dissection while delivering expandable member  10   em  to the intended surgical target location in the abdominal cavity. Once the distal end portion of the introducer/sheath  696  that contains expandable member  10   em  has been located in the vicinity of the surgical target location, the attachment tab  682  (or flange  682 F) that extends distally of the distal end of sheath  696  can be sutured, stapled, tacked, etc. to an internal structure in the abdominal cavity. By incrementally retracting sheath  696 , incremental portions of expandable member  10   em  can be extracted (e.g., and unrolled) with fixation of these portions being accomplished between the incremental extraction steps. Alternatively, expandable member  10   em  can be nearly fully extracted or fully extracted after just the first fixation of the distal end portion has been accomplished, or even without any anchoring of tabs  682 / 682 F if the surgeon desires to just grasp the distal end portion of expandable member  10   em  with graspers or other temporary fixation tool as sheath  696  is retracted.  \\n       FIGS. 22L-22M  illustrate another variation of an arrangement for compacting device  10  and maintaining it the compact configuration for delivery into the abdominal cavity. In another embodiment, device  10  is compacted and maintained in a compact configuration by insertion within a sheath  690  as illustrated in  FIG. 22A . Sheath  690  does not completely encircle expandable member  10   em,  but includes a slit through which a rail or channel connected to expandable member  10   em,  and which is to be connected to frame  600 , is exposed. Device  10  can be compacted into the compressed configuration by rolling it in flexible sheath  690 . In this case, sheath  690  can completely surround device  10  when the device is to be anchored using tabs  150 . Once rolled up, such as by tongue-rolling or other rolling technique, the sheath  690  and device  10  assembly can be further compacted/compressed by drawing it through a funnel compactor  691  as illustrated in  FIG. 22M , by pushing and/or pulling assembly  690 , 10  to the left in  FIG. 22M  and/or pushing or pulling compactor funnel  691  to the right in  FIG. 22M . The small opening of the funnel compactor  691  can be made to have an inside diameter of a maximum, predetermined size acceptable for delivery of the assembly through a small opening and into the abdominal cavity.  \\n      Further optionally, an additional sheath or inserter  696  can be mounted over the small end of compactor funnel  691 , as illustrated in  FIG. 22N , so that the further compressed assembly  690 , 10  is loaded into this additional sheath or inserter  696 . The introducer or sheath  696  can then be inserted through a small opening in the skin of the patient and into the abdominal cavity, where assembly  690 , 10  can be extracted according to any of the techniques described above. Further alternatively, sheath  696  may be open ended at both ends, and a pusher rod can be pushed through the proximal end opening of sheath or introducer  696  to drive the assembly  690 , 10  out of the distal end opening. In any of these arrangements, once the assembly  690 , 10  has been extracted, it can be unrolled, and device  10  can be positioned and anchored according to any of the techniques described herein. Sheath  690  is removed from the abdominal cavity and from the patient.  \\n       FIG. 22O  shows a further alternative arrangement, in which sheath  690  and device  10  after rolling and compressing according to the techniques described above with regard to  FIGS. 22L-22M , is back-loaded on a steerable, flexible endoscope  356 . Alternatively, sheath  690  and device  10  can be wrapped and compressed around steerable, flexible endoscope  356  to backload the assembly  690 , 10  thereon, without the use of compactor funnel  691 . According to either of these techniques, after making a small incision  223  in the patient, the endoscope  356  is advanced through the opening and into the abdominal cavity. The endoscope  356  can be steered during this process to advance the distal tip  790  thereof to a desired location in the abdominal cavity where it is desired to place device  10 . Also, full insufflation of the abdominal cavity is not needed in order to deliver device  10  by this technique. Once the distal tip  796  of endoscope  356  has been steered and advanced to a desired location in the abdominal cavity, assembly  690 , 10  can then be delivered over the shaft of endoscope  356  and ejected off of the distal end of endoscope. Device  10  may be delivered over an anchoring frame  600  using this technique, and/or ejected into the abdominal cavity for subsequent positioning and anchoring by tabs  150 .  \\n      Optionally, as the endoscope  356  assembly is being advanced, impulse puffs of pressurized gas can be intermittently applied through the distal end of endoscope  356  (or with an additional conduit that delivers these impulses to the location of (or just distal to) the distal end of endoscope  356  to help open a pathway along which it is desired to steer the endoscope  356 . Further alternatively, device  10  can be compacted and back-loaded around endoscope  356  without sheath  690 .  \\n      Further alternatively and optionally, endoscope  356  may be provided with an expandable distal tip/lens  790   e  that is expandable distally away from and around the distal end  790  of endoscope through which viewing is performed, as illustrated in  FIGS. 22P-22Q . This expandable tip  790  can be expanded to displace tissue away from viewing end  790  to provide a clear view so the that operator can more easily steer the distal end to a desired location. This arrangement does not require the use of \u201cpuffs\u201d or impulses of pressurized insufflation gas, or any insufflation whatsoever.  FIG. 22Q  illustrates expandable tip/lens as an inflatable balloon which is shown in an inflated/expanded configuration.  FIG. 22R  shows a variant of the tip/lens  790   e  in an expanded configuration, in which balloon  790  is further reinforced by deployable wires  791  that can be extended distally (as shown) and retracted proximally of the distal end  790  when it is desired to have the tip  790  in a non-expanded (undeployed) configuration. Wires  791  can be biased toward the expanded configuration shown, so that they expand the balloon  790   e  without the need to inflation gas or liquid into the balloon  790   e.  Alternatively, balloon  70   e  can be expanded by both gas or liquid (typically liquid) and the mechanical forces applied by expanding wires  791 .  \\n       FIG. 22S  illustrates an alternative to use of a flexible, steerable endoscope  356  inserted and used as a guide rail for delivery of device  10  (as well as, optionally, other devices or instruments) thereover and into the abdominal cavity, as described above with regard to  FIG. 220 . In  FIG. 22S , a flexible wire  502   e  that is similar in construction to guidewire  502 , only slightly larger in cross-sectional diameter, includes one or more optical fibers extending the length thereof to facilitate viewing through the distal end portion  502   de  of wire  502   e.  Accordingly, wire  502   e  can be inserted in the same manner as guidewire  502  and used for the same purposes. However, visualization can be performed as the flexible wire  502   e  is being inserted and advanced, for visual verification that the distal end portion is being delivered to an intended location in the abdominal cavity.  \\n      Optionally, wire  502   e  may include an expandable tip, such as an inflatable balloon, like  70   e  describe above with regard to  FIG. 22Q . This balloon can be expanded to provided an enlarged visual field. By foregoing the steering mechanism of a steerable endoscope  356  and guiding the wire  502   e,  assisted by visualization, into the abdominal cavity in a manner as described with regard to insertion of guidewire  502 , this allows  502   e  to have a significantly smaller cross sectional area than a steerable endoscope  356 .  \\n       FIG. 23  illustrates a device deployment tool  700  that can be used to deploy device  10  over anchoring frame  600 . Tool  700  includes a handle  702  for manual operation by a user (e.g., surgeon) and an elongated shaft  704  extending distally therefrom. Shaft  704  in included a groove or rail that substantially matches a groove or rail of frame  600  over which device  10  is to be mounted. Accordingly, device  10  slides over the groove or rail of tool  700  and can be delivered over guidewire or rod  502  into alignment with the groove or rail of frame  600  where device  10  can then be pushed off of shaft (rail or groove)  704  and over the rail or groove of frame  600  to anchor the expandable member  10   em  of the device  10  to frame  600 . One or more lumens may be provided through shaft  704  for delivery of irrigating fluids (or other substances) and for application of suction to the distal end of shaft  704 , via ports  640  and  642 , respectively.  \\n       FIGS. 24A-24C  illustrate an access member attachment tool  730  and use of tool  730  for rapid attachment of access member  80  to the patient  1 . Access member attachment tool  730  includes a handle  732  for handling and control by a user, and a working end  736  at a distal end portion thereof. According to this approach, an anvil  738  is slid over conduit(s)  12  prior to connecting access member  80  to the distal end(s) of conduit(s)  12 . Working end  736  is configured to received access member  80  therein, e.g., working end may include a socket shaped and dimensioned to receive access member  80  therein and to maintain the orientation of access member so as to control it during attachment to the patient.  \\n      Anvil  738  is first delivered by manipulating (e.g., twisting and pushing) it through opening  223  and through the opening in the abdominal muscle  127 , as illustrated in  FIG. 24B . Distal end  736  of tool  730  may be inserted into the fat layer  131  either before or after manipulating anvil  738  into the desired orientation for use. Once anvil has been inserted through the opening in the abdominal muscle and manipulated to orient the anvil surface  738   s  in contact with the abdominal muscle wall  127 , tool  730  is used to drive access member  80  against anvil surface  738   s  as illustrated in  FIG. 24C . An inner shaft of tool  730  clamps or otherwise engages tubing  12  and/or anvil  738  and draws them toward portion  736  when actuator  744  is actuated. Access member  80  includes penetrating members  740  that extend distally from the contact surface of access member that contacts the abdominal muscle  127  as access member is driven against anvil  738 . As access member  80  is driven against anvil surface  738   s,  penetrating members  740  are driven against the anvil surface  738   s  and thereby bent over, as illustrated in  FIG. 24C , thereby anchoring access member to the abdominal muscle wall. Driving of access member  80  against anvil  738  may be performed by simply pushing with handle  732 . Additionally, or alternatively, and further optionally, actuator  744  may be operably configured to deploy penetrating members distally from the contact surface of access member  80  upon actuation of the actuator.  \\n      Alternative mechanisms may be used for attachment of access member  80  to the patient  1 . For example,  FIG. 25A  shows use of hook and loop type fasteners  746   a,    746   b  or other interlocking mechanism used for a quick connect mechanism to attach access member  80  to the abdominal muscle  127  of the patient  1 . In the example shown, a ring  747  that contains or is made of one of either hook or loop material ( 746   a  or  746   b,  respectively) is stapled or sutured to the abdominal muscle layer  127  to surround the opening in the abdominal muscle and conduit(s)  12 . The contact surface of access member is provided with the other of either the hook or loop material, respectively, such that when access member is pushed against ring  747 , the interlocking mechanism  746  (in this example, hook and loop materials) interlock, thereby attaching access member  80  to the patient.  \\n      In  FIG. 25B , ring  747  is provided with one or more magnets  748   b  having polarity on the surface facing access member  80  that is opposite the polarity of the surfaces of magnets  748   a  facing ring  747 . Ring  747  may be provided with anchors  749  and/or may be sutured, or adhered to abdominal muscle layer  127 . By pressing access member  80  against the anchored ring  747 , connection mechanism  748  connects access member  80  to the patient  1  via the attraction forces of magnets  748   a,    748   b.    \\n       FIGS. 25C and 25D  illustrate undeployed and deployed configurations, respectively, of an access member having deployable anchors  750 . Anchors  750  are extendable, for example, by collapsing external tubing using compression force. By retracting the inner tubing or shaft that is axially positioned inside anchors  750  with a distal end connected thereto, this drives anchors  750  into the extended configuration shown in  FIG. 25D . That is, the functionality is like a moly-bolt. Anchors  750  include arms that are hingedly connected and which bend to expand outwardly, as they are compressed by retracting the internal tube.  \\n       FIGS. 25E and 25F  illustrate undeployed and deployed configurations, respectively, of an access member having a spring member  752  that functions to anchor access member  80  to the patient  1 . In the undeployed configuration of  FIG. 25E , spring member  752  is wound to as to assume a relatively small outside diameter. This wound configuration can be maintained by a safety lock  754  provided in access member that is actuatable between a locked and an unlocked position. After inserting access member  80  into position with respect to the abdominal muscle wall  127 , so that spring member  752  passes through the opening in the abdominal muscle and is located inside the abdominal muscle wall  127  as illustrated in  FIG. 25E , safety lock  754  is released, so that spring member  752  unwinds to its deployed configuration, where it has a much larger outside diameter that is too large to pass back through the opening in the abdominal muscle  127 , see  FIG. 25F .  \\n       FIGS. 25G-25H  show an embodiment of access member that is connectable via a snap fit that provides a clamping action between base  80   b  and external portion  80   e.  Base  80   b  is provided with a spacer  756  having a length about the same as the thickness of the abdominal muscle  127 . The top portion of tubular spacer is provided with a lip  756   a  that has a outside diameter slightly greater than the inside diameter or the opening  758   a  to socket  758 . Base  80   b  inserted through the opening in the abdominal muscle and oriented so that contact surface  80   sb  aligns with the inner wall of abdominal muscle  127  and spacer  756  extends out through the opening in the abdominal wall  127 . External portion  80   e  is then pressed against base  80   b  with tubular spacer  756  aligned with socket  758 , so that lip  756   a  snaps through opening  758   a  and is retained within socket  758 , thereby connecting access member  80  to the abdominal wall  127 .  \\n      Anchoring frame  600  may be provided with an interlock  760  on a proximal end portion thereof, as shown in  FIG. 25I . In this case, anchoring frame  600  is provided with sufficient length to extend to the location against the abdominal wall  127  where it is desired to attach access member  80 . Interlock  760  may be provided with resiliently deflectable teeth  762  that deform as engagement members  764  ( FIG. 25J ) located on access member  80  are inserted therethrough. Engagement members may have threading or be otherwise formed to have alternating large and small diameter portions, so that the large diameter portions deflect teeth  762 , while the small diameter portions allow teeth  762  to rebound thereagainst to form a lock relative to the adjacent large diameter portions.  \\n       FIGS. 25K  shows an embodiment of access member  80  that is connectable via an automatic engagement mechanism  763  that functions like a chuck for a pneumatic tool. That is, the base portion that is inserted intra-abdominally includes a socket portion having one or more sets of spring-loaded bearings or detents  765 , and the external portion includes a tubular shaft to be inserted into the socket portion and which has one or more annular recesses  767  configured to mate with detents  765 . Thus, when the tubular shaft of the external portion is inserted into the socket portion, the outer wall of the tubular shaft depresses detents  765  allowing the tubular shaft to be further inserted. When aligned with annular recesses  767 , detents resiliently return to their orientations shown in  FIG. 25K  and are received in recess(es)  767 , thereby locking the two components of access member  80  together on opposite sides of the abdominal muscle  127 .  \\n       FIGS. 25L-25M  show another variation of an air hose type of quick connector. In either this embodiment or the embodiment of  FIG. 25K , the male and female connector parts can be reversed relative to the positions shown. In this embodiment, connector  769  may be provided either as a part of access member  80 , or simply as a connector for anchoring device  10  to the abdominal wall  127  and/or to provide a connection to conduit  12  that extends externally of the abdominal wall. Balls  765  and groove  767  function in the same way as described above with regard to  FIG. 25K . However, in this instance, connector  769  includes a locking sleeve  771  that slides over balls  765  to maintain them in the locked configuration ( FIG. 25L ). Locking sleeve  771  is retractable, as shown in  FIG. 25M  to allow balls  765  to deflect radially outwardly to allow insertion of the male portion of the connector  769  into the female portion and then slide sleeve  771  back over balls  765  to lock them in position in groove  767 . Sleeve  771  may be spring biased toward the closed/locked position, wherein it can be manually retracted to the unlocked position.  \\n      As already noted, device  10  may be implanted by a variety of different methods, including percutaneous methods (examples of which have been described in detail above and which typically do not require pressurized insufflation of the entire abdominal cavity, or generalized anesthesia, and one or more steps may be performed without direct visualization), laparoscopic methods (which typically include pressurized insufflation of the entire abdominal cavity and the patient  1  under general anesthesia), min-laparoscopic methods and open methods. In addition to anchoring device  10  via anchoring frame  600 , or alternative thereto, other anchoring features and/or techniques may be employed. Any of the various features and/or techniques described herein may be used together, or separately, unless it use of one feature or technique would clearly preclude use of another specifically disclosed feature and technique and they would therefore not be useable together.  \\n      One such method of anchoring involves anchoring device  10  to the abdominal wall  127  via tubing extending from device  10  and through the abdominal wall. For example, conduit  12  may be used to accomplish such anchoring, as illustrated in  FIG. 26A . In examples where device  10  is implanted an expanded in the space along the diaphragm  116  as described above, it has been experienced, that, once expanded, expandable member  10   em  maintains its position quite well in superior-inferior directions with tendency to move being more likely laterally. By anchoring device  10   e  to the abdominal wall using tubing  12 , this secures expandable member  10   em  from such lateral movements. Because device  10  is less likely to move superiorly or inferiorly, this type of anchoring may be sufficient in itself for implantation of device  10 . An advantage of anchoring only by this technique is that no suturing or stapling inside the abdominal cavity is required. In  FIG. 26A , a lock nut  766  is threaded over tubing  12  to secure expandable member  10   em  in contact with the inner abdominal wall  127 . Lock nut  766  may include a contact surface covered with tissue ingrowth material such as Dacron, polyester, or other porous material designed to encourage tissue ingrowth or may be formed entirely of a tissue ingrowth material. Further optionally, access member  80  may be configured to function as an anchor to replace the lock nut, wherein access member  80  can be fixed by any of the features described herein. This method of anchoring assists in positioning device  10  and stabilizing it in its intended position.  \\n      In addition or alternative to providing tissue ingrowth enhancing material on the external side of the abdominal muscle wall  127 , tissue ingrowth enhancing material  768  may be provided at the interface between expandable member  10   em  and the inner wall of the abdominal muscle  127 , as illustrated in  FIG. 26B . For example, a disk of tissue ingrowth enhancing material  768  may be slid over conduit  12 . Alternatively, one or more attachment tabs including tissue ingrowth enhancing material  768  may be fixed to device  10 , such as expandable member  10   em,  as described in more detail below. Examples of tissue ingrowth-enhancing materials include, but are not limited to, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (having an internodal distance typical of those materials used for vascular grafts); mesh materials made of polyester, polypropylene, or the like, typically with pores in the range of about 0.7 mm to about 1.5 mm or about 0.5 mm to about 1.2 mm; polyester having a maximum water permeability of about 1800 to about 4000 ml/cm 2 /min; or felts made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester having a maximum water permeability in the range of about 550 to about 3050 ml/cm 2 /min.  \\n      In addition or alternative to anchoring device  10  against an intra-abdominal structure (e.g., abdominal muscle wall or other structure) using conduit  12 , device  10  may be provided with a positioning member  770  that can be used to further position or relocate device  10  and assist in anchoring device  10  in such position or location.  FIG. 26C  illustrates an example of a device  10  including a loop (similar to a belt loop, and which may be made of Dacron-reinforced tubing, for example) shaped positioning member  270 . When used in a laparoscopic procedure or other procedure using multiple ports through the patient&#39;s skin and into the abdominal cavity, device  10  can be inserted through a first port. A suture or tether  59  can be looped through positioning member  770  and tied off to form a looped suture or tether  59 . Then a surgeon or assistant can access the suture or tether  59  via an incision adjacent the port through which the device  10  was inserted, to hook, grasp or otherwise capture suture or tether  59  and pull it out through the incision where access was made ( FIG. 26D ). For example, graspers, an elongated instrument having a hook at a distal end thereof, or other endoscopic instrument may be used to capture suture or tether  59  and pull it out of the opening though the patient&#39;s skin. This tension exerted on suture or tether  59  and pulling of the suture or tether  59  out of the patient draws device  10  toward the opening through which suture or tether is drawn, thereby drawing an inferior surface of expandable member  10   em   1  up against the abdominal wall  127  in this example. Alternatively, tension may be applied to the suture or tether  59  as it extends from the opening through which the device  10  was inserted, to draw attachment tab(s)  150  up against the abdominal wall for attaching tab(s)  150  thereto. For a percutaneous procedure where only a single port is provided for delivery and implantation of device  10  an additional puncture can be performed through the patient&#39;s skin and into the abdominal cavity, at a location where it is desired to draw suture or tether  59  through and to draw device  10  against an intra-abdominal structure. For example, an elongated needle  772  ( FIG. 26E ) having a hooked slot  774  may be used to pierce the patient&#39;s skin, access the abdominal cavity, and capture suture or tether  59  in hooked slot  774 . Needle  772  can then be retracted out of the patient  1  to draw suture or tether  59  out of the patient to draw device  10  against a structure in the abdominal cavity to anchor it there.  \\n       FIG. 26F  illustrates a step of attaching attachment tab  150  to the abdominal wall  127 , according to one embodiment using a laparoscopic procedure. In this case, tension is applied to tether/suture  59  as it extends through the opening  223 /port  390   a  that was used to insert device  10  into the abdominal cavity. As tension is applied graspers  784  having been inserted through port  390   d are used to manipulate attachment tab  150  to approximate it to the abdominal wall  150  for attachment thereto. Thus, tension may also be applied via the graspers  784 . A laparoscopic stapler  786 , inserted through port  390   b  is used to staple attachment tab(s) to the abdominal wall  127 . Visualization of all operations can be provided via endoscope  356  inserted through port  390   c.  It is noted that invention is not limited to the locations and number of ports shown, as the locations and numbers may vary. For example, an additional opening may be provided to insert a liver retractor for retraction of the liver during the procedure, such as was described in application Ser. No. 11/407,701 with regard to  FIG. 67 . Also, the arrangement of the instruments shown may vary depending on need for the steps being performed. As one non-limiting example, stapler  786  may be inserted through port  390   c  while endoscope  356  is inserted through port  390   b.  Further alternatively, suture/tether may be drawn through another port, as already noted above. This attachment process can be carried out in addition to fixing device  10  to an anchoring frame  600  according to any of the techniques described above, or alternative to it, where a frame  600  is not used.  \\n      Further optionally, device  10  may be provided with a plurality of positioning members  770  such as positioning loops, for example, spaced longitudinally along device  10 . Two, three, four or more such members  770  may be provided along expandable member  10   em,  for example.  FIG. 26G  shows an example of device  10  having three positioning loops  770  longitudinally spaced along expandable member  10   em   1 . By providing multiple positioning members  770  that are longitudinally spaced, the same device can be used for patients having different anatomies that may have different positioning requirements for the expanded device  10  and or may have different volume requirements of a spaced to be filled by device  10 . Depending upon the loop  770  selected by the surgeon to be used to position and anchor device  10 , device  10  can be anchored, for example to the abdominal wall  127 , with more or less of the surface of expandable member  10   em   1  drawn up against the abdominal wall  127 . This in turn varies the angulation and positioning of device  10  in the abdominal cavity. Typically, the surgeon will have an idea of which positioning member  770  is to be used for the particular patient that device  10  is being implanted in, for example, after studying the anatomy of the patient&#39;s abdominal cavity and structures therein, as provided by prior MRI or CT scanning for example. In such case, only one positioning member  770  will have a suture or tether  59  looped there around to be used as described above. Alternatively, more than one, up to all of the positioning members  770  may have a suture or tether  59  looped there around so that the surgeon can try alternative positioning with more that one positioning member, using one at a time successively and observing (such as by fluoroscopy, for example) the relative positions of device  10  resulting from each use of a different positing member  770 . The \u201cbest fit\u201d can then be selected and used to complete the anchoring of the device. Prior to that however, the tethers or sutures  59  that are not chosen for final use in positioning are cut and removed through the opening that will be used to draw the selected tether or suture therethrough for positioning. Thus, these cut, non-selected tethers or sutures  59  are removed from the surgical site prior to use of the selected suture or tether  59  to perform attachment/anchoring of device  10 .  \\n      Still further, positioning members  770  may be segmented  777  to provide multiple positioning features or channels  778  within a loop  770  (as illustrated in  FIG. 26H ) or multiple positioning members  770  may be spaced in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal spacing (as indicated in phantom lines in  FIG. 26G ) to provide further positioning control choices for orienting device  10  angularly about a longitudinal axis, as indicated by the direction of orientation adjustment  776  in  FIG. 26G . The choice of positioning member  770  among the longitudinally spaced members  770  varies the positioning about a transverse axis of device  10  (i.e., axis passing into the page and through the middle of expandable member  10   em   1 .  \\n      To facilitate anchoring of device  10  after positioning by positioning members, device  10  may be provided with one or more attachment tabs  150 .  FIG. 26F  illustrates a single continuous attachment tab  150  that extends from expandable member  10   em   1  about a circumferentially extending portion of the surface of the inferior portion of expandable member  10   em   1 . Attachment tab  150  may be bonded to the surface of expandable  10   em   1 , such as with silicone dip layer, for example, or using room temperature vulcanizing silicone adhesive. Alternatively, unvulcanized silicone sheeting can be placed between tab  150  and expandable member  10   em  and these layers can be vulcanized together using a heated press. Further alternatively, if the materials are made of polyurethane, a solvent bond can be made using a slurry mixture of polyurethane to bond a polyurethane tab  150  to a polyurethane expandable member  10   em.    \\n      Alternatively, multiple attachment tabs  150  can be placed at locations around expandable member  10   em  to extend from and substantially cover areas covered by a larger single attachment tab  150 .  FIG. 27A  illustrates one such example of a device  10  with multiple attachment tabs  150 , in this case, having three attachment tabs  150 . By providing multiple attachment tabs, the tabs are more easily able to conform to the structure that they are being attached to, particularly if there is some curvature or other surface shape other than planar in the structure. That is, tabs  150  can be overlapped to reduce the overall coverage of the structure to be attached to and this increases the convexity of the attachment surfaces formed by tabs  150  to better conform to a concave shape of an internal surface of the structure to be attached to (e.g., abdominal wall), or otherwise change to a surface shape to be conformed to, or spread apart to increase the convexity of the attachment surfaces formed by tabs  150 , or otherwise change to a surface shape to be conformed to. The overlapping prevents folds or wrinkles that would otherwise occur with a single tab  150  such as like that in  FIG. 26F , and the spreading would just not be possible with a single tab like that shown in  FIG. 26F . The use of attachment tab(s)  150  also gives the surgeon the option to not use access member  80  and/or conduit  12  to perform an anchoring function. This allows access member  80  to be placed further away from the ribs, potentially offering the patient less discomfort, and also allows conduit  12  to be placed so that it is not under tension to perform an anchoring function, thereby lessening the mechanical requirements for conduit  12 .  \\n      Attachment tabs  150 , although typically located to extend from the inferior portion of expandable member  10   em,  need not be so located, but can be placed to extend from any locations on device  10  or expandable member  10   em.  As one example,  FIG. 261  shows a device  10  having an attachment tab  150  extending from a superior portion of expandable member  10   em  and another attachment tab  150  extending from an inferior portion of expandable member  10   em.  Tab  150  will typically be provided with a tissue ingrowth material, such as any of the examples described above. In at least one embodiment, polyester-reinforced silicone sheeting forms the base structure of tab  150  and this is the material that is bonded onto a silicone expandable member  10   em.  The tissue ingrowth-enhancing members or patches  152  are then separately bonded onto the base structure. In at least one alternative embodiment, the base structure is made of polyester-reinforced polyurethane sheet, while the tissue ingrowth-enhancing member s or patches  152  can be made of any of the same materials already described above. Tabs  150  can withstand a tensile force of at least about three to five pounds, on a suture looped therethrough, without tearing of the base structure or the suture ripping out of the base structure.  \\n      Tabs can be attached to an intra-abdominal structure by stapling, tacking, suturing or the like.  FIG. 28  illustrates one configuration of attachment tab  150 , wherein the main body portion  150   a  includes a tissue ingrowth-enhancing material. However, a margin portion  150   b  is provided that connects to expandable member  10   em  that is not tissue ingrowth promoting. Accordingly, after anchoring device  10  via attachment tab  150  to a tissue structure within the abdominal cavity, the anchoring may be further fortified after a healing period by the ingrowth of tissue into main body  150   a.  However, since no tissue ingrowth occurs at margin  150   b,  device  10  can be more easily removed, if necessary, by cutting through the margin material  150   b,  thereby releasing device  10  from the anchored main body portion  150   a.  Further advantageously, margin portion  150   b  can be made of clear material so as to also function as a \u201cwindow\u201d so that the surgeon can view through it while performing the attachment of main body  150   a  to ensure that no bowel or other tissue not meant to be anchored to, exists between attachment tab  150  and the tissue intended to be anchored to, at the time of anchoring. For example, margin portion  150   b  may be made of silicone or other transparent material that is biocompatible and has sufficient mechanical strength to maintain the attachment/anchoring function.  \\n       FIG. 27B  illustrates an example of a device having three attachment tabs  150  extending from the inferior portion of expandable member  10   em,  but where the tabs  150  are interjoined by margin portions at the side of the main bodies  150 . The margin portions are separate to allow tabs  150  to be overlapped. Additionally, margins  150   b  completely surround the main body portions  150   a  in this embodiment. Potential suturing (or stapling, tacking, or the like) locations are indicated by the circles  150   s  shown on each of the main body portions  150   a.  The circular structure shown centrally located between the tabs  150  is another tab that may include tissue ingrowth enhancing material and/or the base structure material of tabs  150 . A positioning loop may be attached to the center of the circle or pass therethrough and be bonded beneath the circle, and used in a manner as described in Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3, e.g., see  FIGS. 22 and 23  and descriptions thereof). Alternatively or additionally, this circular structure may be a grasping feature for the surgeon to manipulate the expandable member  10   em  during the implantation process. In this case, the circular patch is bonded to the expandable member only over a central portion thereof, with a free edge or border that is not bonded, so that it can be grasped by graspers or other instrumentation. Backing structure  10   ds  may be made, for example, of a reinforced silicone sheet to help distribute the forces generated on attachment tabs anchored to the intra-abdominal structure, over a large area of the expandable member  10 em. The backing structure  10   ds  may be made of multiple layers of reinforced silicone with non-reinforced silicone sheeting at the margins to provide an interface with expandable member  10   em  that substantially avoids generation of stress concentrations. The backing structure  10   ds  also provides structural support to expandable member  10   em  (e.g., to help prevent kinking) and helps define and maintain the expanded shape of expandable member  10   em  in the expanded configuration. The substantially oval-shaped patch above the circular one is also a grasping feature.  \\n       FIG. 27C  schematically illustrates various features that may be provided for attachment of device  10  within the abdominal cavity, any of which may be used individually, or in any combination with any of the other features disclosed. Any individual use or combination of these features may also be used in addition to anchoring with anchoring frame  600 . \u201cActive attachment\u201d features or methods includes those that involve mechanical or chemical attachment of a portion of the device to the patient, including, but not limited to, sutures, tacks, staples, adhesives, etc. \u201cPassive attachment\u201d features or method refer to configuring a surface to enhance tissue ingrowth therein or to encourage encapsulation, for example. Thus, all or a portion of expandable member  10   em  (and/or other component of device  10 ) may be provided with a roughened or \u201cbumpy\u201d surface  788 , as such surfaces have been shown to encourage encapsulation of an implant. Also, porous surfaces  782  may be provided on any portion of device  10  that is desired to be anchored, to encourage tissue ingrowth. Thus, for example, attachment tab  150  can be used solely as a passive attachment feature when it is not actively stapled, tacked or sutured to the abdominal wall, but is merely placed in apposition thereto, and includes a porous portion  782  that allows tissue to grow into it. Alternatively, attachment tab could be completely nonporous, such as made of silicone, and attached only actively, such as by stapling. Further alternatively, attachment tab  150  may function for both active and passive attachment when it is stapled, tacked, sutured or adhered to an intra-abdominal structure and also includes a porous portion that encourages tissue ingrowth. Further, any of the other components may include a tissue ingrowth surface on a part or all of such component to provide passive attachment. For passive attachment, a period of about three to about six weeks is generally sufficient to anchor a tissue ingrowth surface of the type described herein, with ingrown tissue. In one experiment a one square inch surface of such material, after three weeks implanted in a dog was found to hold eight pounds of force. The omentum may also be actively attached to device  10  as serve as a buffer between device  10  and other organs in the abdomen to reduce irritation.  \\n      Optionally, in order to assist the surgeon in properly orienting attachment tab(s)  150  for attachment to the intended intra-abdominal structure, attachment tab(s) may be provided with one or more structural members  152  ( FIG. 29A ) that are deformable, so that attachment tabs  150  can be compacted to a compact configuration for delivery of device percutaneously or laparoscopically, but which resiliently return to their non-compacted shapes when a compacting force is no longer applied to attachment tabs  150 . For example, structural member  152  may be a rib or sheet of shape memory material, such as nickel-titanium alloy or shape memory plastic, or may be made of spring steel (e.g., stainless steel). Alternatively, attachment tabs  150  may be inflatable, so that they can be expanded to a preshaped and predetermined orientation to facilitate the surgeon&#39;s placement of the attachment tabs against the tissue to be anchored to, and anchoring the tabs  150  to the tissue. Inflatable tabs  150  can have attachment features such as flanges at the borders thereof that are not inflatable so that sutures, staples, tacks, etc, can be passed therethrough to anchor the tabs  150  without deflating them. These inflatable tabs  150  may also include tissue ingrowth enhancing materials on portions thereof to encourage long term, permanent attachment of the tabs when tissue grows into this material. If multiple attachment tabs  150  are provided, as in  FIG. 29B , a single conduit  153  may be provided to inflate/expand the attachment tabs  150 , or multiple conduits may be provided. For example, a conduit  153  may be provided for the inferiorly located tabs  150 , another conduit may feed the intermediately located tabs  153  and a third conduit may connect to the superiorly placed tab  150 . Further alternatively, each attachment tab  150  may be provided with a dedicated conduit  153  in fluid communication therewith.  \\n       FIGS. 29C-29E  illustrate another variation of a self-expanding attachment tab  150 . In this case, structural member  152  is a self-expanding wire frame configured to conform the attachment tab(s) to the intra-abdominal structure that attachment tab(s)  150  is/are intended to be anchored to.  FIG. 29C  illustrates attachment tab  150  in the self-expanded configuration, wherein wire-frame  152  is biased toward this configuration. Wire frame  152  may be made of spring steel (e.g., stainless steel), nickel-titanium alloy, or shape-memory polymer, for example. The self-expanding wire frame  152  may be sandwiched between layers of, or embedded in the material of the attachment tab(s), for example Dacron-reinforced silicone.  \\n       FIG. 29D  illustrates attachment tab  150  in a compressed configuration in preparation for loading into a sheath and/or insertion of device through a small opening in the patient  1 . Wire frame  152  collapses into the shape shown under compressive forces applied radially inwardly on tab  150 .  FIG. 29E  illustrates device  10  having been inserted into the abdominal cavity, whereupon attachment tab  150  expands via the self expansion of wire frame  152  thereby orienting attachment tab  150  in approximation with the abdominal wall  127  and to conform to the curvature thereof for attachment thereto. Expandable member  10   em  is illustrated in an expanded configuration.  \\n       FIGS. 29F-29G  show another example of device  10  provided with a self expanding attachment tab  150 . In this case, self-expanding member  152  includes bands of resilient, self-expanding material such as any of those discussed above with regard to wire frame  152 . Self-expanding member may be sandwiched, or embedded in tab  150  in a manner as also described previously.  FIG. 29F  shows tab  150  fully expanded and expandable member  10   em  also in an expanded configuration.  FIG. 31 G  illustrates expandable member in a contracted or deflated configuration. Self expanding member  152  in this embodiment is compressed by folding over the bands of the member toward expandable member  10   em  as shown. Conduit  12  (not shown) may pass through a central opening  152 o of self expanding member  152  and tab  150 .  \\n       FIGS. 29H-29I  illustrate another example of device  10  provided with a self expanding attachment tab  150 . In this case, self-expanding member  152  includes folded bands or bows of resilient, self-expanding material, such as any of the previously mentioned materials. Bows are biased toward the folded-over configuration shown in  FIG. 29H , where they provide an enlarged radius that prevents tab  150  from passing back through the opening through which device was delivered into the patient and expand attachment tab  150  to conform to the abdominal wall  127  for attachment thereto.  FIG. 29I  shows expandable member  10   em  in a compressed configuration and self-expanding member also in a compressed configuration, in preparation for delivery of device  10  through a small opening in a patient and into the abdominal cavity. In this embodiment, self expanding member  152  is compressed by applying tension to the proximal end thereof while holding the distal end relatively motionless, whereby it is pulled in the proximal direction to lengthen the self-expanding member, while straightening the bows and thus greatly reducing the radius of self expanding member  152 /attachment tab  150 . Self-expanding member may be sandwiched, or embedded in tab  150  in a manner as also described previously.  \\n      Further alternatively, the embodiment shown in  FIGS. 29H-29I  may be made from straight bands of spring steel or other material described previously and thus be biased toward the smaller radius, collapsed configuration illustrated in  FIG. 291 . In this case, the proximal and distal end rings of structural member  152  are provided with mating interlocking connectors  152 L 1  and  152 L 2 , respectively. Thus, after insertion of device  10  in the collapsed configuration shown in  FIG. 291 , the proximal end connector  152 L 1  is pushed toward the distal end connector  152 L 2  while applying a pulling or tension force to the distal end connector  152 L 2  (for example, by applying tension to conduit  12 ). When connectors  152 L 1 ,  152 L 2  meet, they interlock, thereby maintaining structural member in the expanded configuration shown in  FIG. 29H .  FIG. 29J  illustrates one example of connectors  152 L 1 ,  152 L 2 , whereby one of the connectors includes resiliently deformable tangs, which are received and locked in the other of the connectors upon joining. Connectors  152 L 1 ,  152 L 2  are not limited to the type shown in  FIG. 29J , but could be alternative types of mechanical connectors, such as arrangements designed to produce a snap fit, as would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.  \\n      A portion of expandable member  10   em  may be customized to provide a surface shape that is tailored to better conform to an intra-abdominal structure to be anchored to. For example, for attachment to the inner surface of the anterior abdominal muscle wall  127 , the portion  10   ema  of the expandable member  10   em  that contacts the abdominal wall  127  is provided to have a more flattened surface shape, relative to the contour of the remainder of expandable member  10   em.    FIG. 30A  illustrates the orientation of expandable member  10   em  of device  10  when implanted in a patient according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the hatched portion  10   ema  of expandable member  10   em  indicates the portion that contacts the abdominal wall  127 . Expandable member  10   em  is placed anteriorly of the stomach and is oriented from an inferior and anterior portion against the anterior abdominal wall  127  towards the spine in a posterior direction, and towards the head in the superior direction.  FIG. 30B  illustrates the more flattened surface conformation of portion  10   ema  relative to the curvature of the remainder of expandable member  10   em.  Locations of optional attachment tab(s)  150  are indicated in phantom lines. Portion  10   ema  is provided with a matching contour to the contour of the abdominal wall  127  in the location where it contacts the abdominal wall  127 . This matching contour not only facilitates attachment of attachment tab(s)  150 , but also facilitates proper orientation of expandable member  10   em,  even when attachment tab(s) are not used to anchor at this location.  \\n      Alternatively, the portion  10   ema  that provides the surface for conforming to the abdominal structure to be anchored to (e.g., abdominal wall) may be provided on an inflatable member  10   em   3  that is expandable independently of expandable member  10   em  (or  10   em   1  or  10   em   2 ) as illustrated in  FIGS. 31A-31D .  FIG. 31A  shows inflatable member  10   em   3  in an expanded (inflated) configuration while expandable member  10   em  is in a non-expanded or compressed configuration.  FIG. 31B  shows inflatable member  10   em   3  in an expanded (inflated) configuration and expandable member  10   em  in an expanded configuration. Separate access members  80  may be provided for inputting compressed liquid through conduits  12  and  123  to expandable members  10 em and  10   em   3 , respectively, as shown in  FIG. 31A . Alternatively, conduits  12  and  123  may both be connected to a multi-channel access member  80 . With both expandable members  10   em  and  10   em   3  deflated, the members can be substantially flattened as illustrated in  FIG. 31C . Expandable members  10   em  and  10   em   3  can then be tightly rolled about the longitudinal axis of device  10 , in the direction of the arrow shown in  FIG. 31C  or direction opposite thereto, to form a compact, rolled device ready for delivery into a patient, see  FIG. 31D . Device  10  can be inserted in the arrangement shown, or, optionally, may be encased in a sheath (not shown) for delivery thereof.  \\n      After insertion of device  10  though an opening in the patient and into the abdominal cavity, expandable member  10   em   3  can be expanded as shown in  FIG. 31A  (either before or after securement of the one or more access members  80  to the patient) whereupon surface  10   ema  closely approximates the inner anterior abdominal wall  127 . Surface  10   ema  can then be attached to the abdominal wall by suturing, stapling, tacking, etc. one or more attachment tabs  150  to the abdominal wall. Expandable member  10   em  can next be expanded to fill the space for restricting expansion of the stomach (and optionally, compressing the stomach), or the patient  1  can be closed up and allowed a healing period prior to returning for expansion of expandable member  10   em.    \\n      To assist in orienting attachment tab(s) and device  10  into an intended location and orientation to be implanted in, conduit  12  may be integrated with, or attached to attachment tab  150  to extend radially outward along the attachment tab. Since conduit  12  extends out of the body even after device  10  has been inserted into the abdominal cavity, manipulation and positioning of attachment tab  150  can be performed by pulling and/or pushing on conduit  12  from a location outside the body.  FIG. 32A  shows an example of a device  10  having two expandable members  10   em   1 ,  10   em   2 , wherein a conduit  12  ( 12   1  or  12   2 ,  12   2  in the example shown) for one of the expandable members  10 em 1 ,  10   em   2 , respectively) extends proximally from expandable members  10   em   1 ,  10   em   2 , such as through an opening in attachment tab  150 , and a conduit fluidly connected to the other of the expandable members  10   em   1 ,  10   em   2  extends radially outward from the expandable member that it connects with, along attachment tab  150 .  \\n      Conduit  12  may be sandwiched between layers of attachment member  150  or may be fixed to the surface of attachment member  150  for example, by overlaying banding strips  780  and adhering the ends of the banding strips on opposite sides of conduit  12  to attachment tab  150 , as illustrated in  FIG. 32B . For example, banding strips  780  may be made of silicone or reinforced silicone (e.g., Dacron reinforced silicone) and may be adhered to attachment tab  150  using RTV (room temperature vulcanizing) silicone adhesive. As an alternative to the use of banding strips  780 , a banding sleeve  782  may be provided that extends over a majority of the length of the radius (or distance from where attachment tab connects to expandable member  10   em  to the free edge perimeter) of attachment tab  150 , as illustrated in  FIG. 32C . Banding sleeve  782  may be made of any of the same materials as banding strips  780  and may be adhered in the same way.  \\n      In use, device  10  may be inserted through a small percutaneous opening  223 , as described above, or through a port in a laparoscopic procedure, with both conduits  121 ,  122  extending out of the insertion opening. In the case of a laparoscopic procedure, a tool, such as a grasper or other tool designed for laparoscopic use can be inserted through a second opening or port  390  to capture one of the conduits (e.g., conduit  12 , as shown in  FIG. 32D ) and draw it out of the second opening  390 . Conduits  122  and  12 , can then be manipulated to move and position attachment tab(s)  150  into a desired location against the anterior abdominal wall  127 . In the case of a percutaneous procedure, a small puncture can be made at  390 , using a tool  772  such as described with regard to  FIG. 26E , for example, or other tool or combination of tool configured to perform a puncture and to capture a conduit  12 , and the conduit can then be capture and withdrawn through the opening  390 . Laparoscopic ports  390  may have a diameter of about ten to about twelve millimeters, up to about eighteen millimeters and as small as about five millimeters, although the typical size is about eight to twelve millimeters. Percutaneous opening  223  may be formed by an incision less than about seven cm, typically less than about five cm.  \\n      Alternatively, conduits  12   1  and  12   2  may pass through separate attachment tabs  150 , as shown in  FIG. 34E . By providing separate or segmented attachment features  150 , this allows more flexibility in placement of the attachment tabs  150  as to anchoring location, and also may help in conforming to the tissues to be anchored to, but still provides the control of positioning and orientation of the inferior portion of device  10  and attachment tab  150  that was described with regard to  FIG. 32D  above. Attachment tabs  150  may be separate, as shown in  FIG. 32E , or this flexibility may also be provided by a segmented attachment tab  150  as illustrated in  FIG. 32F , where  12   2o  shows an opening through which conduit  122  passes and  12   1o  shows a tunnel or lumen through which conduit  12   1  passes. If the outermost layer of expandable member  10   em  is made of silicone, RTV silicone adhesive can be used to adhere attachment tab(s)  150  to the expandable member. One or more of the attachment tabs  150  may extend along expandable member  10   em,  or may join with backing support  10   ds  to provide a larger surface area for force distribution. These extensions and/or backing support  10   ds  may optionally also be provided with one or more patches of tissue ingrowth-enhancing material. Further, the a portion or all of a side of expandable member, such as the anterior facing surface, as illustrated in  FIG. 27B  may be coated with a layer or otherwise structurally reinforced so as not to expand, or at least not expand as much as the remainder of expandable member  10   em,  to prevent or at least reduce expansion of expandable member in the anterior direction, and thereby reduce any visible bulging on the external abdomen of the patient (i.e., skin appearance/shape outside the abdominal cavity), while expandable member  10   em  is allowed to preferentially expand posteriorly and medially to effect filling of the space intended to be filled.  \\n      In an alternative attachment procedure, tube  12   1  and  12   2  can be routed through different openings in a patient, similar to any of the ways described above with regard to  FIG. 32D . However, in this alternative approach, attachment tabs  150  are not attached (at least not stapled, tacked or sutured to the abdominal wall, but they may be maintained to encourage tissue ingrowth, or a more conforming tissue ingrowth layer can be provided over an inferior portion of expandable member  10   em,  or neither) to the abdominal wall. Rather, tubes  12   1  and  12   2  are used to position and orient device  10  as desired and device  10  is anchored via tube  12   1  and  12   2 , using nuts, sutures, access members, or any of the other features/techniques described previously. Thus, no suturing or stapling to the abdominal wall (at least to the abdominal wall inside the abdominal cavity) is required.  \\n      In any of the procedures described herein, it may be advantageous to orient the patient on his back, with the table angled from about fifteen to about forty-five degrees, typically about thirty degrees, to elevate the head of the patient  1 . This causes the organs in the abdominal cavity to shift in and inferior direction thereby providing more space in the superior portion of the abdominal cavity and adjacent the diaphragm  116  to facilitate the insertion procedures.  \\n       FIG. 33  illustrates a distal end portion of a flexible, endoscope  356  that may be used in a mini-laparoscopic or laparoscopic procedure to assist visualization of the placement of device  10  during an implantation procedure. Endoscope  356  may be used with our without additional fluoroscopic visualization. For example, in an office setting, use of endoscope  356  without any fluoroscopic visualization may be sufficient for a minimally invasive procedure such as described herein. Endoscope  356  includes an atraumatic lens  790  at a distal end portion thereof, with a camera or other visualization means  792  (e.g., optical fibers extending up to the lens  790  or a CCD camera placed just proximally of lens  790 ) to provide an image that is delivered to the proximal end of endoscope  356  outside of the body of the patient. The shaft  794  of endoscope  356  is flexible, may be constructed according to existing flexible catheter technology and typically has an outside diameter of five mm or less, preferably about four mm or less, more preferably about three mm or less. The diameter of endoscope shaft  794 /lens  790  is in the range of about two to about ten mm, typically about five mm. The distal end portion of endoscope  356  is steerable, as illustrated by the phantom lines in  FIG. 33 , and endoscope  356  may be maneuvered or steered into a surgical site to provide a desired view, as well as steered, once in a desired site, to provide panning of a location in the abdomen. Steering may be controlled by wires that run along the length of viewing fibers within shaft  794  up to the tip  790 . The wires that the proximal end portion are connected to a steering mechanism that tensions the wires and causes deflections at the tip of the scope  356 . For a more detailed description, see Breedveld et al., \u201cA New, Easily Miniaturized Steerable Endoscope\u201d, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, November/December 2005, pp. 40-47, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. Alternatively, endoscope  356  may be inserted through a guide catheter for delivery of the distal end portion to a desired location.  \\n      Once the distal end of endoscope  356  has been maneuvered into a desired viewing location, a balloon  796 , that is mounted annularly around shaft  794  just proximal of lens  790 , can be inflated to lift adjacent tissues to improve the visualization through lens  790 .  \\n      Another feature for anchoring expandable member  10   em  of device  10  is illustrated in  FIG. 34 . This feature includes ratcheted teeth (e.g., spaced teeth  800  and a collar  802 . The teeth  800  are spaced along conduit  12  and annularly surround the conduit wall to radially extend outward therefrom. Teeth  800  have an outside diameter at a distal portion thereof that is larger than the inside diameter of collar  802 , and the proximal end portions of teeth  800  have an outside diameter that is less than the inside diameter of collar  802 . Further, teeth  800  are deformable, and tapered to allow them to be pulled through collar  802 . As a tooth  800  passes through collar  800  it deforms to allow the passage, and then re-expands to its original configuration. Since the distal ends of teeth  800  are not tapered or beveled, teeth  800  are prevented from passing back through collar  802  in the distal direction. Thus, upon insertion, initial placement and expansion of expandable member  10   em,  the surgeon can next place collar  892  up against the external surface of the abdominal wall  127 , as shown in  FIG. 34 , and pull conduit  12  proximally therethrough to pull one or more of teeth  800  through collar  802 , thereby anchoring expandable member  10   em  to the abdominal wall. The surgeon can adjust the positioning of expandable member  10   em,  according to the number of teeth  800  that are pulled through collar  802 , wherein the teeth  800  and collar  802  function like a ratchet. The conduit  12  extending proximally of collar  802  is connected to access member  80  which can also be attached to the abdominal wall at another location. This arrangement also relieves stress from access member  80  and the connection of conduit  12  with access member  80 .  \\n      While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective, spirit and scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) estimates that over 120 million Americans are overweight, including about 56% of the adult population. Of these, about 52 million are considered obese, as measured by a body mass index (BMI) of 30% or greater. In Europe, an estimated 77 million people are obese, as measured by the same standard. This problem is not limited to western nations, as many developing countries are reported to have obesity rates over 75% of the adult population. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\"> Co-morbidities that are associated with obesity include, but are not limited to type II Diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, stroke and arthritis, the symptoms of which often tend to be lessened or alleviated upon loss of weight by a person so affected. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\"> In the U.S., options for treatment of obesity are currently quite limited. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\"> Current treatment methodologies typically rely upon surgically introducing a \u201cmalabsorptive\u201d environment in the gastro-intestinal tract, a restrictive environment, or a combination of these. One available treatment method is gastric bypass surgery and another is referred to as gastric banding (one of these techniques is referred to as the LAPBAND\u2122 procedure). These procedures are limited to only those patients with a BMI over 40 (or over 35, with co-morbidities present). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\"> Gastric bypass procedures incur a great deal of morbidity and create a malabsorptive state in the patient by bypassing a large portion of the intestines. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\"> Serious side effects, such as liver failure have been associated with this procedure, as well as chronic diarrhea. Another surgical procedure that has a high degree of morbidity associated with it is known as the \u201cGastric Bypass Roux-en-Y\u201d procedure. This procedure reduces the capacity of the stomach by creating a smaller stomach pouch. The small space holds only about one ounce of fluid. A tiny stomach outlet is also surgically created to slow the speed at which food leaves the stomach. Staples are used to create a small (15 to 20 cc) stomach pouch, with the rest of the stomach being stapled completely shut and divided from the stomach pouch. The small intestine is divided just beyond the duodenum, brought up, and connected to the newly formed stomach pouch. In addition to the considerable morbidity associated with this procedure, other disadvantages include \u201cdumping syndrome\u201d, where stomach contents are literally \u201cdumped\u201d rapidly into the small intestine which may lead to nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, and diarrhea; hernias resulting from the surgery; gallstones; leakage of the connection between the pouch and the intestine; stretching of the pouch that was formed; nutritional deficiencies; and possible dehiscence of the staples. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\"> The LAPBAND\u2122 is a band that, when placed, encircles the fundus-cardia junction and is inflatable to constrict the same. It does not reduce the volume of the stomach, but rather restricts passage of food into the stomach, the theory being that the patient will feel satiety with a much smaller volume of food than previously. Although the LAPBAND\u2122 procedure is less invasive than a gastric bypass procedure, it also typically achieves less weight loss. Further, it is not a simple procedure and requires a substantial amount of training by a surgeon to become proficient in performing the procedure. Also, a substantial amount of dissecting and suturing is required because the pathway by which the band is introduced is not an existing pathway, and must be established by dissection. Great care is required to avoid blood vessels and nerves that may be in the intended pathway to be created by the dissection. After placing the band around the fundus-cardia junction, the ends of the band must be connected together and then it must be cinched down into place. Additionally, complications such as erosion at the fundus-cardia junction, slippage of the band from its intended location, nausea/vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, dysphagia and lack of effectiveness in causing weight loss have been reported. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\"> Intragastric balloons have also been placed, in an attempt to fill a portion of the volume in the stomach, with the theory being that it will then require less food than previously, to give the patient a sensation of fullness or satiety. This procedure involves delivery of a balloon (typically, transorally) to the interior of the stomach and inflation of the balloon to take up a portion of the volume inside the stomach. However, intragastric balloons may also lead to complications such as obstruction, vomiting and/or mucosal erosion of the inner lining of the stomach. The balloon can break down over extended exposure to the stomach&#39;s acids, and in some cases, after breaking down, the balloon translated through the intestines and caused a bowel obstruction. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\"> Gastrointestinal sleeves have been implanted to line the stomach and/or a portion of the small intestines to reduce the absorptive capabilities of the small intestine and/or to reduce the volume in the stomach, by reducing the available volume to the tubular structure of the graft running therethrough. Although weight loss may be effective while these types of devices are properly functioning, there are complications with anchoring the device within the stomach/GI tract, as the stomach and GI tract function to break down things that enter into them and to move/transport them through. Accordingly, the integrity of the anchoring of the device, as well as the device itself may be compromised over time by the acids and actions of the stomach and GI tract. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\"> A sleeve gastrectomy is an operation in which the left side of the stomach is surgically removed. This results in a much reduced stomach which is substantially tubular and may take on the shape of a banana. This procedure is associated with a high degree of morbidity, as a large portion of the stomach is surgically removed. Additionally, there are risks of complications such as dehiscence of the staple line where the staples are installed to close the surgical incisions where the portion of the stomach was removed. Further, the procedure is not reversible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\"> In the laparoscopic duodenal switch, the size of the stomach is reduced in similar manner to that performed in a sleeve gastrectomy. Additionally, approximately half of the small intestine is bypassed and the stomach is reconnected to the shortened small intestine. This procedure suffers from the same complications as the sleeve gastrectomy, and even greater morbidity is associated with this procedure due to the additional intestinal bypass that needs to be performed. Still further, complications associated with malabsorption may also present themselves. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\"> An inflatable gastric device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,893, in which a balloon is inserted anteriorly of the stomach and posteriorly of the left lobe of the liver. The balloon is then inflated to compress the stomach so that it fills with less food that would ordinarily be possible. Not only does this device compress the stomach, but it also compresses the liver, as seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> of the patent, which may cause complications with the liver function. Additionally, the balloon is simply placed into this location, and there is no assurance that it will not migrate and lose its effectiveness in compressing the stomach to the degree intended. Still further, the balloon is of a simple spherical design, and, as such, extends pressure outwardly in all directions, 360 degrees, in all planes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\"> Accordingly, the liver is compressed just as much as the stomach is. Also, the compression forces against the stomach are not ideal, as the spherical balloon conformation does not match the conformation of the expanding stomach. The stomach is not spherical when expanded, or concave with a constant radius of curvature, but expands into a designated space that allows the fundus to expand preferentially more than other parts of the stomach. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\"> Brazzini et al. in WO2005/18417 discloses at least two or more expandable devices used to treat obesity, in which the devices are inserted through the abdominal wall and anchored against the external surface of the stomach wall by an anchoring mechanism that extends through the stomach wall and fixes to the internal surface of the stomach wall. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\"> U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0261712 to Balbierz et al. describes capturing a device against the outer surface of the stomach wall to form a restriction that appears to function similarly to the restriction imposed by the LAPBAND\u2122. The anchoring of the devices disclosed relies upon placement of features against the internal wall of the stomach to form an interlock with the device which is placed against the external wall of the stomach. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\"> U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0267533 and 2006/0212053 to Gertner disclose devices for treatment of obesity that use one or more anchoring mechanisms that are passed through the wall of the stomach to establish an anchor. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\"> U.S. Pat. No. 6,981,978 to Gannoe discloses devices for reducing the internal cavity of the stomach to a much smaller volume, which may be used to carry out a bypass procedure. Stapling is employed to isolate the smaller volume in the stomach, and thus the same potential disadvantages are present as with other stapling procedures described herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\"> U.S. Pat. No. 6,186,149 to Pacella et al. describes an occluder device that can be used as a dietary control device (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8C</figref>). The occluder device is placed against the wall of the stomach and inflated to press inwardly on the stomach wall. A frame is wrapped around the stomach wall and is inflated to press against the stomach wall. However, there is no disclosure of how the frame might be adjusted to maintain a position relative to the stomach wall as the size of the stomach varies. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\"> Gastric reduction techniques have been attempted, such as by inserting instruments trans-orally and reducing the volume of the stomach by stapling portions of it together. However, this technique is prone to failure due to the staples pulling through the tissues that they are meant to bind. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\"> Techniques referred to as gastric pacing endeavor to use electrical stimulation to simulate the normal feedback mechanisms of a patient that signal the brain that the patient is full, or satiated. While these techniques are less invasive than some of the other existing treatments, statistics to date have shown that the amount of weight lost by using such techniques is less than satisfactory. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\"> Currently marketed drugs for weight loss, such as XENICAL\u00ae, MERIDIA\u00ae and Phen fen have largely failed, due to unacceptable side effects and complications, and sometimes to an ineffective amount of weight loss. Other drugs that are on the horizon include ACCOMPLIA\u00ae and SYMLIN\u00ae, but these are, as yet, unproven. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\"> The risk and invasiveness factors of currently available surgeries are often too great for a patient to accept to undergo surgical treatment for his/her obesity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\"> Accordingly, there is a need for less invasive, yet effective surgical treatment procedures for morbidly obese patients (patients having a BMI of 35 or greater). Also, since the current surgical procedures are currently indicated only for those patients having a BMI of 40 or greater, or 35 or greater when co-morbidities are present, it would be desirable to provide a surgical procedure that would be, available for slightly less obese patients, e.g., patients having a BMI of 30 to 35 who are not indicated for the currently available surgical procedures. It would further be desirable to provide a surgical procedure that would be indicated for obese patients having a BMI in the range of 30-35, as well as for more obese patients. </p>\\n    <heading

INVENTION </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0159\"> Before the present devices and methods are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0160\"> Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed. Each smaller range between any stated value or intervening value in a stated range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included or excluded in the range, and each range where either, neither or both limits are included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0161\"> Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0162\"> It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca tube\u201d includes a plurality of such tubes and reference to \u201cthe incision\u201d includes reference to one or more incisions and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0163\"> The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided may be different from the actual publication dates which may need to be independently confirmed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0007\" num=\"0000\"> Definitions </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0164\"> A \u201ccompliant\u201d material refers to a material that is stretchable or expandable. This expansibility allows the material to increase in dimension substantially more than a noncompliant or semi-compliant material, prior to failure. For example, when formed as a balloon structure, a compliant material comprises an expansibility property of being able to increase its radius, beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, by 100 percent or more, without rupturing. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0165\"> A \u201cnoncompliant\u201d material refers to a material that, when formed as a balloon structure, can increase its radius beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, only up to about 10 percent or less prior to rupturing. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0166\"> A \u201csemi-compliant\u201d material refers to a material that, when formed as a balloon structure, can increase its radius beyond its formed radius, under pressure applied into the balloon, by an amount between about 10 percent and about 100 percent, prior to rupturing. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0167\"> The \u201cwall\u201d of the stomach refers to all of the layers that make up the stomach wall, including the mucosa, submucosa, muscular layers and serosa. A \u201clayer\u201d, \u201clayer of the stomach wall\u201d or \u201cstomach wall layer\u201d refers to a mucosal layer, submucosal layer, muscular layer or serosal layer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0168\"> A \u201cproximal\u201d end of an instrument is the end that is nearer the surgeon when the surgeon is using the instrument for its intended surgical application. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0169\"> A \u201cdistal\u201d end of an instrument is the end that is further from the surgeon when the surgeon is using the instrument for its intended surgical application. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0170\"> An \u201cinternal body structure\u201d when referred to as a structure to which a device is to be anchored, refers to a structure internal to the skin of a patient, and which can be within the abdominal cavity of the patient, or just outside of it, such as including the outer surface of a wall that partially defines the abdominal cavity. Structures to which a device can be anchored include, but are not limited to: one or more ribs, the intercostal muscles, the abdominal surface of the diaphragm, the stomach (but where the anchor does not pass through the wall of the stomach), the anterior abdominal wall, the posterior abdominal wall and the lateral abdominal wall, the esophagus, the angle of his in the stomach, the gastro-intestinal junction, the gastro-esophageal junction, the columnar ligaments of the diaphragm near the gastro-esophageal junction, the superior aspect of the omentum, peritoneum, liver, connective tissues, ligaments, and blood vessels. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0171\"> A \u201cbody floss wire\u201d is a wire that enters and exits the body in two locations and passes inside the body between the two locations. This arrangement allows excellent control of the tension on the wire, as forces can be applied at both end portions of the wire that enter and exit the body. Additionally, this arrangement provides good control of devices being passed along the wire. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0172\"> The preferred embodiments of the present invention prevent the possible issue of erosion caused by an expandable member, by not requiring anchoring to the stomach, and further, by not requiring a compression force to be applied when the stomach is not full of food. By allowing the stomach to move freely in the constrained spaced provided by the expandable member, the stomach&#39;s possible expansion size will be decreased, but there will be less opportunity for the formation of pressure necrosis since no one region will be subjected to concentrated forces. With the device in place, there is substantially no distensibility of the stomach as normal exists with an unconstrained stomach. With distensibility restricted and gastric volume reduced, as the patient ingests food, the intra-gastric pressure will rise to a level sufficient to produce satiety without distension or volume expansion of one or more regions of the stomach. The device occupies so much volume in the abdominal cavity that the stomach does not substantially depart from the shape set by the device even when filled with food. Another physiological benefit of the device is that the stomach&#39;s ability to relax in response to ingestion of food is reduced or eliminated, through producing earlier satiety. One additional physiological benefit of the expandable member may further be to substantially reduce the actual volume of the stomach itself, remodeling the organ as the muscle contracts into its new shape over the period of weeks or months Oust as the heart remodels when constrained from over-expansion). Remodeling the stomach allows the expandable member to be implanted temporarily. The preferred embodiments also are positioned in a location to completely or mostly fill the space normally occupied by the fundus, thus moving the stomach medially and wedging the stomach between the expandable member and the medial and anterior aspects of the liver, and the spine posteriorly. This position also ensures that the expandable member is almost entirely maintained underneath the diaphragmatic umbrella beneath the ribs on the left side, thus concealing the expandable member, and preventing it from producing an unsatisfactory cosmetic result. Further, the preferred embodiments can have elements for anchoring on one or more locations along the abdominal cavity wall to prevent migration. Further, the preferred embodiments are provided with an outer surface that is very atraumatic. Embodiments described at least one expandable member, preferably an inflatable member, made of a material or material composite that is impermeable to gas, as well as embodiments having at least two expandable members, with one expandable member being inflated with a gas and another expandable member being inflated with a liquid. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0173\"> The device embodiments of the present invention can be placed with a number of minimally invasive techniques, such as those often referred to as percutaneous, laparoscopic, mini-laparoscopic, or key-hole. Particularly important in at least one embodiment, the procedure requires no general anesthesia and typically only a single, small opening in a patient is required to deliver an implantable device. In particular, in at least one embodiment the procedure can be performed outside of an operating room setting with local anesthesia or conscious sedation and generally without pressurized insufflation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0008\" num=\"0000\"> Abdominal Cavity Anatomy </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0174\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the anatomy of the abdominal cavity and its contents, and surrounding features. The abdominal cavity <b>100</b> is shown divided among four quadrants, the upper right quadrant <b>102</b>, upper left quadrant <b>104</b>, lower left quadrant <b>106</b> and lower right quadrant <b>108</b>, as divided by the median axis <b>110</b> and transverse axis <b>112</b>. The lower edge of the ribcage is illustrated by the dotted line <b>114</b> and the diaphragm is shown at <b>116</b>. As seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the diaphragm <b>116</b> is shaped like a parachute and sits within the ribs. The esophagus <b>118</b> passes through the diaphragm <b>116</b> and joins with the stomach <b>120</b>. The left lobe <b>122</b> of the liver <b>121</b> lies anteriorly of the esophagus <b>118</b> and the fundus-cardia junction <b>119</b>. In one aspect of the invention, an expandable device is implanted in an extra-gastric location (i.e., outside of the stomach) generally indicated at <b>124</b>, and then expanded to occupy a space that the fundus of the stomach would ordinarily expand into when the stomach is filled with food. The expanded device prevents this expansion by the fundus, thereby limiting the volume of the cavity in the stomach to a much smaller volume than if the fundus had been allowed to expand into the space. Alternatively, the device is expanded to apply pressure to the fundus of the stomach in a downward direction (e.g., in a direction toward the transverse axis <b>112</b> shown, with some transverse movement toward the median axis <b>110</b> shown), and optionally, additionally to the main body of the stomach, to reduce the volume inside the stomach to effect satiety in the patient with relatively less food ingested, relative to what the patient would require for satiety without the implant in place. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0009\" num=\"0000\"> Devices </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0175\"> At least some embodiments of devices described herein can be implanted percutaneously, with a relatively quick and simple procedure that requires no general anesthesia and wherein only a single, small opening in a patient is required to deliver the device, which typically has a single expandable member that is self anchoring or can be easily anchored to maintain the simplicity and minimal invasiveness of the procedure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0176\"> In other embodiments, more complex configurations of expandable members are provided, where a device can contain one or more expandable members and implantation and anchoring can be performed laparoscopically. Any of the devices described herein can, of course, be implanted using open surgical procedures. Devices that can be implanted percutaneously can alternatively be implanted using laparoscopic procedures. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0177\"> Devices described herein can be implanted permanently, but are also configured for reversibility, to facilitate relatively simple removal procedures, should it be desired to remove a device. Alternatively, devices according to the present invention can be implanted temporarily, such as over a period of months, and then removed or disabled when further treatment is no longer required, or to allow an alternative treatment to be applied. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0010\" num=\"0000\"> Device Body Configurations </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0178\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show views of a device <b>10</b> having a main body <b>10</b> <i>m, </i> <b>10</b> <i>em </i>with a shape and size approximating the shape and size of the full (post-prandial) stomach <b>120</b> <i>b. </i>Although main body <b>10</b> <i>m </i>need not be expandable/collapsible to perform restriction of stomach expansion, main body <b>10</b> <i>m </i>is typically formed from one or more expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em </i>as will be described in further detail below, for better performance of intended functions and to allow less invasive procedures for implanting the same. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0179\"> Main body <b>10</b> <i>m,</i> <b>10</b> <i>em </i>includes curved left and right sides <b>10</b> <i>l </i>and <b>10</b> <i>r, </i>respectively (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the posterior surface of main body <b>10</b> <i>m,</i> <b>10</b> <i>em</i>), wherein the left side <b>10</b> <i>l </i>is convex and the right side <b>10</b> <i>r </i>is concave such that the main body <b>10</b> <i>m, </i> <b>10</b> <i>em </i>takes on a somewhat kidney-shaped configuration. However, the superior portion <b>10</b>s is substantially larger and more bulbous than the inferior portion <b>10</b> <i>i, </i>since the fundus portion of the stomach <b>120</b> expands much more than the antrum upon receiving food. Thus, as seen in the right side view of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref>, the superior portion <b>10</b> <i>s </i>is very bulbous and almost spherical, with a larger cross section than the inferior portion <b>10</b> <i>i, </i>while the inferior portion is more nearly hemispherical, with the center portion of the main body tapering from the superior portion <b>10</b> <i>s </i>to the inferior portion <b>10</b> <i>i. </i>Configured as such, the main body <b>10</b> <i>m,</i> <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>when implanted properly, will occupy the space that naturally exists from the stomach <b>120</b> to expand into when expanding from a pre-prandial configuration to a post-prandial configuration. By severely limiting this expansion capability, the patient is thereby able to consume only a significantly smaller volume of food than possible if the implant were not present. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0180\"> Device <b>10</b> sizes will likely vary depending on the size of the skeletal system of the patient into which device <b>10</b> is to be implanted, particularly the size of the rib cage. Further variations may be made to tweak or adjust the amount of restriction along any desired location of the stomach that interfaces with device <b>10</b>. One typical variation is in the length and/or size (diameter or expandability capacitance) of the inferior portion <b>10</b> <i>i. </i> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref> illustrate two variations of device <b>10</b> in which the inferior portion of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3D</figref> is longer and thus extends further inferiorly and medially than the inferior portion of the expandable member shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>. In both cases, expandable member is shown in an expanded configuration, and a full, unrestricted stomach <b>120</b> is illustrated behind the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to illustrate the relative amount of restriction that each expandable member shown would impose on the stomach <b>120</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0181\"> At least a portion of main body member <b>10</b> <i>m </i>may be expandable. The entire main body <b>10</b>m may be made of an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>When in an expanded configuration, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can optionally only abut or lie adjacent to the pre-prandial stomach wall, without imparting any significant deformation forces thereto. However, when the patient eats and the stomach begins to fill, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in this case prevents the stomach <b>120</b> from expanding into the volume occupied by expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>In such a case, the stomach <b>120</b> becomes \u201cdeformed\u201d as it attempts to expand and can only expand in a limited fashion, if at all, around a portion of the perimeter of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Thus, upon expanding the device <b>10</b>, the device <b>10</b> expands in the space(s) normally occupied by the stomach <b>120</b> as the stomach <b>120</b> expands when receiving food. Thus device <b>10</b> exerts pressure on, or at least prevents expansion of the fundus and optionally, the antrum. In embodiments where the expandable device <b>10</b> is not attached to the stomach, the stomach is free to perform its normal function of mixing food in the stomach for digesting and pushing food out of the stomach. During all of this movement the stomach may slip behind, beside or on top of the expandable device, but the internal volume of the stomach will be held to its smaller volume as the expandable device <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is occupying the space into which the stomach would normally expand. Further details of methods for treatment of obesity, including procedures for implanting devices described herein are described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\"> As noted above, an expandable device <b>10</b> can be implanted adjacent a surface of the stomach wall, either in contact therewith or at a predetermined distance therefrom, to prevent expansion of the stomach <b>120</b> into a volume occupied by the expandable device <b>10</b>. Alternatively, some embodiments of the devices described herein can be configured and placed to exert an external compression on one or more locations of the stomach to deform the stomach wall, thereby decreasing the internal volume of the cavity within the stomach that accepts food and liquid intake. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates (by arrows) potential locations on the stomach <b>120</b> wall that can be compressed (or restricted from expanding) by one or more devices <b>10</b> as described herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\"> In one embodiment, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> is composed of an inflatable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Inflatable members described herein can be inflated with gas or liquid or both. Examples of gases or liquids that can be used to inflate inflatable members/devices <b>10</b> include, but are not limited to: carbon dioxide, helium, isotonic dextrose solution, iostonic saline solution, air. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\"> It may be preferable to inflate at least a portion of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> with one or more gases, to minimize the weight of the implanted device <b>10</b>, as an expandable member of the configuration shown can have an internal volume approaching a liter, when filled, and a heavier, fluid-filled device of this type may be more noticeable to the patient. Alternatively, devices <b>10</b> can be inflated with a porous gel that is porous or microporous to encapsulate air or other gas bubbles, thereby reducing the weight of the gel while still permitting it to apply volumetric pressure to expand an inflatable member. Such gels may be settable, such as ultra-violet (uv) curable or otherwise chemically curable, or, alternatively, can remain in the gel state, so that they can be readily removed or added to, to increase or decrease the amount of inflation/expansion of the expandable member. Gels can be made from a flowable viscoelastic substance made of a polymer mixture, such as silicone oil, boric acid, hyaluronic acid, polyacrylic acid or combinations thereof, for example. The gel, as delivered into the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>(e.g., such as by injection or the like) can be aerated or infused with carbon dioxide or an inert gas to create a deformable or non-deformable cellular structure that encapsulates the gas in cells, and thus has relatively low mass but still has significant resistance to compression or deformation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\"> When inflating an inflatable member with a pressurized gas, some materials, especially the compliant materials such as silicone, polyurethane and the like, may have an inherent porosity as it is stretched during the expansion, such that it may not adequately maintain a desired pressure within the membrane or wall of the inflatable member over an extended period of time. This seepage or slow leakage of gas from the inflatable member may require a patient to have the implant checked more frequently then required for other physiological concerns, to ensure that it is maintaining adequate pressure and thus is expanded to the extent desired to perform the desired amount of deformation of the stomach. Materials such as silicone and polyurethane have a good history of long term biocompatibility when used as implants and are two of the preferred materials for use in making devices <b>10</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\"> The inflatable members of the inflatable devices described herein can include compliant, noncompliant or semi-compliant materials, or any combination of these. Examples of compliant materials suitable for use in an inflatable member as described herein include, but are not limited to: silicone, latex rubber, and polyurethane. Examples of useable semi-compliant materials include, but are not limited to: nylon, polyethylene, polyester, polyamide and polyurethane, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,500,148, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. Polyurethane, nylon, polyethylene and polyester can be compliant or semi-compliant materials, depending upon the specific formulation and hardness or durometer of the material as produced. Examples of noncompliant materials that can be used in the construction of inflatable members described herein include, but are not limited to: polyethylene terepthalate (PET) and urethane. Urethane can be a compliant, semi-compliant or non-compliant material depending upon its specific formulation and hardness or durometer. Compliant, semi-compliant and noncompliant categories are not solely material limited, but are better defined by their expansion characteristics, as noted above. Some materials are best suited for use in one of these categories (e.g., silicone and latex work well to make compliant structures), but other materials can be formulated and/or constructed to provide compliant, semi-compliant or noncompliant properties. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\"> One way of eliminating or substantially reducing seepage, such as when an expandable member comprises a compliant material that is stretched to a degree that would normally exhibit such seepage, is to provide a very thin metallic coating over the compliant material using a biocompatible metal to form the coating, as the metal layer is substantially nonporous when the integrity of such layer is maintained. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> is a photograph of an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>formed by sputtering a layer of titanium over a polyurethane expandable member formed in a shape as described with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> above. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in an expanded configuration. In order to avoid wrinkles in the metallized layer of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>the compliant material (e.g., polyurethane in this case) was stretched over a mold configured in an expanded shape of the expandable member and welded in this three dimensional configuration, while inverting the seams, so that the smooth, seamless configuration shown resulted. Other biocompatible metals (e.g., silver, gold, tantalum, palladium, platinum or some other biocompatible metal) may be substituted for titanium, and compliant materials other than polyurethane (e.g., silicone, latex rubber, etc.) can be substituted for the substrate of such an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\"> Another approach to reducing seepage is by co-extrusion, e.g., co-extruding EVOH (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer) and polyurethane to form the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>with or without a metallic coating as described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0189\"> Further descriptions of methods and materials for making a metallic coated expandable member can be found in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595 which was incorporated by reference above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0190\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a device that employs two expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. The two expandable members in this case are separately and independently expandable, and may be expanded both by the same expansion medium (or by mechanical expansion methods/features described herein), or may be expanded by different expansion media or techniques or mechanical features, to provide what is termed herein as a hybrid device. In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, both expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>are designed to be inflated by gas, liquid, combination of gas and liquid, foams or any of the other inflation media described above. In one particular hybrid embodiment, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>is inflated by one or more gases and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>is inflated by a liquid such as isotonic saline or isotonic dextrose solution, for example. Since expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>contains a large volume, as noted above, this expandable member is inflated with a gas so as to be less noticeable by the recipient patient when implanted. In use of this hybrid configuration, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>is fully inflated to occupy the space into which the stomach would normally expand when taking in food. Accordingly, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>may be designed as a \u201cfixed volume\u201d expandable member, such that this expandable member will be expanded to a predetermined pressure so as to occupy a known volume. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, having a much smaller expanded volume than expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>(for example, the volume of <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>can be about 75 to about 80 percent of the total volume of the implant, i.e., about 75 to 80 percent of the combined volumes of <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>+<b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>) uses a liquid medium for expansion thereof, as noted above. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>may be designed as a variable volume expandable member, so that expansion thereof can be varied to add to the fixed volume of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>in the amount desired. In use, this liquid medium can be used to adjust the degree of expansion of expandable <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, once the expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>has already been established to further compress into the stomach <b>120</b> or to better interface with the surface of the stomach, as the liquid in a less than fully expanded expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>is able to conform well to the surface shape of the stomach. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0191\"> One particular location that many surgeons are interested in restricting and/or compressing is the Angle of His, and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>is placed to provide further compression capability at this location of the stomach <b>120</b> when device <b>10</b> is implanted as described. Also, since liquid is relatively incompressible, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>exhibits less give, causing the stomach to be deformed at the interface between the stomach and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, rather than compression of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. Further, the liquid-filled chamber <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>provides a softer surface to interface with the stomach then would the surface of a pressurized, fully expanded gas-filled chamber. Still further, because liquid is relatively incompressible, a user knows how much additional volume the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>is being expanded by (and thus also the relative degree of additional compression provided) when a specific volume of liquid is inputted through lumen <b>122</b>. Thus, for example, if a physician adds 60 cc of liquid through lumen <b>122</b>, the physician will know that the volume of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>has expanded by 60cc. Further, the use of liquid in the expandable member (such as expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>) may provide relatively more pressure in preventing expansion of the stomach due to the density of the device, relative to one that is filled with gas. Further, the liquid may feel more \u201corgan-like\u201d, since organs are primarily liquid, and therefore be generally better tolerated by the stomach and other organs in the abdominal cavity. Still further, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>can be expanded to a state where the properties of this expandable chamber do not exhibit significant seepage, so that this pressure can be maintained for an extended period of time. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>on the other hand, can be expanded to a much greater percentage without concern about seepage, since materials used are much less porous to liquid. For example, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>may be made of one or more plies of titanium-coated polyurethane, as described above, and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>may be formed of silicone. For example, the silicone expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>can expand up to at least 800 percent of its normal volume. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0192\"> In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>is shown partially inflated. When fully deflated, the external surface of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>can be compressed to contact and conform to the adjacent wall of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>that it overlies. Further infusion of fluid into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>causes it to expand outwardly in the directions indicated by the arrows in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, as can be seen, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>in this example has been placed to primarily effect compression of the fundus (or further reduction of the space provided for the fundus to normally expand into). However, the invention is not limited to this design, as expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>could be lengthened to also provide further expandability in the region of the antrum of the stomach, or could be provided to expand only against the antrum. Further, other placements of such a secondary expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>can be designed to tailor the directionality of additional compression forces (and/or space filling) to be applied. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0193\"> In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, a dual lumen conduit <b>12</b> is provided for inputting expansion media into the two expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. Thus lumen <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>leads to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and lumen <b>122</b> extends into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and leads into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. Alternatively, lumen <b>122</b> can extend externally over expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and then enter into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0195\" num=\"0194\"> Further variations and embodiments of devices having expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>are described in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595 which was incorporated by reference above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0196\" num=\"0195\"> The reduction in volume of the \u201cfull\u201d stomach that can be achieved by filling the space that the stomach normally expands into and/or compression of the stomach that is achievable by any of the devices described is in the range of about 700 cc to about 1,200 cc. The adjustable range of device <b>10</b> can be about zero cc to about 650 cc or about 50 to 600 ml, typically about 100 to 500 ml or 100 to 400 ml, wherein variations in these ranges can be achieved by varying the degree of expansion of one or more expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>With a hybrid device described above the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>is expanded to occlude most, if not all of the space into which the fundus (and optionally antrum) would normally expand when taking in food, with any medial space remaining between expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and the empty stomach being fillable by adjusting the degree of expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. Thus, for example, if the full volume capacity of a stomach <b>120</b> (with no implant impeding its expansion) is about 1,000 cc, then device <b>10</b> can be configured to initially displace about 400 to 600 cc of volume, so that the stomach&#39;s remaining capacitance is about 400 to 600 cc. Over time, device <b>10</b> can be expanded to occupy 800 to 900 cc of space, so that the stomach&#39;s capacity is reduced to about 100 to 200 cc. This adjustment can be done incrementally over time, for example. A hybrid device <b>10</b> such as the one described with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> can be implanted and the initial volume displacement referred to can be achieved by inflating expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>with gas, for example. Further subsequent reductions in the stomach&#39;s capacity can be achieved by adding fluid to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>to expand this member as desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0196\"> As noted above, the expandable members described herein may be expanded by an expansion medium (such as liquid, gas, gas and liquid, foam, etc.) or by mechanical expansion methods and/or features. It should be further noted here that a single expandable member can be expanded (and/or maintained at a desired degree of expansion) by a combination of one or more expansion media and one or more mechanical expansion methods and/or features. We refer to these as complex expandable members and examples of such are described below. Thus, for example, an expandable member that is inflated by gas pressure may be further supported by some other expansion means, such as a mechanical expansion member. This mechanical expansion member can alleviate some of the pressure that would otherwise be required to maintain the expandable member at a predetermined size (volume). Further, if seepage occurs, the secondary (mechanical) expansion member can maintain the expandable member at the desired volume. It is further noted here that a complex expandable member can be used in a device <b>10</b> having a single expandable member, such as like that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, or may be combined with one or more additional expandable members, e.g., like the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, wherein the one or more additional expandable members may be expandable by expansion medium or expansion method and/or features, or may also be a complex expandable member. In at least one embodiment, device <b>10</b> is provided with a complex expandable member having the shape of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> above, and a second expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, like that described in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> above is provided as a fluid expandable member. Further examples and embodiments of devices employing at least one complex expandable member are provided in provisional application Ser. No. 60/877,595. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0198\" num=\"0197\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> illustrate a \u201cnested chamber\u201d configuration of an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>in which chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>-<b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>4</b> (although different numbers of chambers can be provided, which number may be two, three, or more than four) can be sequentially expanded, to vary the size of the expandable member and thus the amount of restriction and/or compression of the stomach to be applied by device <b>10</b>. Adjacent chambers are separated by a baffle or membrane <b>36</b> that may be formed of the same material as the wall of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>with each baffle or membrane <b>36</b> containing at least one one-way valve <b>38</b> therein. Valves <b>38</b> are configured to open at progressively greater pressures, so that the chambers can be opened sequentially and only to the extent desired, based on the amount of pressure applied through conduit <b>12</b>. Reduction in the overall volume of expandable member <b>10</b>em can be achieved by passing a guide wire through conduit <b>12</b> and through all valves <b>38</b>. Valves <b>38</b> open when the guidewire is extended therethrough, allowing the contents of each chamber to funnel out through conduit <b>12</b>, thereby deflating the expandable member. After this, the chambers can again be sequentially inflated as described to achieve the desired volume. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0199\" num=\"0198\"> More specifically, in the example shown, the valve <b>38</b> in the membrane <b>36</b> separating chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> opens at a lower pressure than the valve <b>38</b> in membrane <b>36</b> separating chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b>. Similarly, the valve <b>38</b> in membrane <b>26</b> separating chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> opens at a lower pressure than the valve <b>38</b> in membrane <b>36</b> separating chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>4</b>. The relative locations of the chambers are not limited to those shown, but can be altered to utilize the effects of the pressure-controlled sequential expansion to first occupy primary spaces desired to be filled to block expansion of the stomach, or to apply pressure to the stomach, with subsequently expanding chambers expanding to provide supplemental space filling//pressure in adjacent areas. An operator could choose only to inflate chamber <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> by inflating to a pressure less than that at which the valve <b>38</b> between chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> opens at. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7A</figref>, expandable member has been inflated to a pressure greater than the pressure at which valve <b>38</b> separating chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> opens at. Therefore, both chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> have been inflated. This may provide sufficient restriction/compression for some patients, or for initial treatment of a patient. In some cases, even inflation of only chamber <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> may be sufficient for early treatment or for patient&#39;s having a relatively small rib cage, for example. After progress in losing weight has been made over time, or for patients with a larger rib cage, for example, the operator may want to increase the size and/or length of expandable member <b>10</b>em (in the example shown, both are accomplished). By inputting more gas through conduit <b>12</b> to establish a higher pressure to meet or exceed the pressure at which valve <b>38</b> (positioned between chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b>) opens, valve <b>38</b> is force open, thereby inflating chamber <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7B</figref>. Chamber <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>4</b> can be inflated by increasing the pressure still further to open the valve <b>38</b> between chambers <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> and <b>10</b> <i>c</i> <b>4</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7C</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0200\" num=\"0199\"> Any inflatable expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>described herein, whether inflatable by gas, liquid or some combination thereof may be provided with a safety valve. Thus, for example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates each of expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>being provided with a safety valve <b>40</b>. Safety valve <b>40</b> may be a flapper valve or other type of pressure release valve that opens when a predetermined pressure has been exceeded. Thus, safety valve <b>40</b> prevents overpressurization/overfilling of the expandable member that it is installed in. Safety valve <b>40</b> can be particularly valuable if the patient that the expandable member is implanted in is subjected to trauma (e.g., automobile accident, fall or other sudden impact that would spike the pressure in the expandable member and possibly cause catastrophic failure), or, in the case of an expandable member inflated with gas, in situations such as cabin depressurization in an aircraft, etc. When pressure within the expandable member has returned below the predetermined pressure (through escape of gas and or fluid from the safety valve <b>40</b>) safety valve closes again, thereby retaining the remaining gas and/or fluid. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0201\" num=\"0200\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment, in which safety valve <b>40</b> is in fluid communication with a reserve expandable member <b>10</b> <i>emr. </i>In this case, if the patient is exposed to any of the conditions described above (which may also include simply moving from a low altitude location, e.g., sea level, to a location high in the mountains, for example) or any condition that would cause expandable member <b>10</b>em to significantly expand, thereby causing the compliant material that it is made of to become more porous resulting in leakage of gas therethrough, the rise in relative pressure that would ordinarily cause such an expansion instead opens safety valve <b>40</b> and gas passes therethrough and into reserve expandable member <b>10</b> <i>emr </i>that is formed of a noncompliant material. Reserve expandable member <b>10</b> <i>emr </i>is shown in an expanded configuration in phantom lines in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>. The noncompliant material of reserve expandable member <b>10</b> <i>emr </i>prevent gas loss, and the gas in reserve expandable member <b>10</b> <i>emr </i>can then be recaptured into expandable member <b>10</b>em when the patient has returned to the \u201cnormal\u201d altitude from where he started, or once the traumatic event has ended. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0202\" num=\"0201\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> illustrate an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that includes excess material for additional expansion capacitance, whether inflated by gas or liquid or some combination thereof. Expandable member <b>10</b>em can be made from any of the materials and by any of the techniques described previously. In this embodiment, excess material <b>42</b> is provided, such as in the form of pleats, folds, corrugations, or the like, and this portion of the expandable member does not expand upon initial expansion of the expandable member. That is, at a first pressure P<b>1</b>, at which the expandable member <b>10</b>em is inflated (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9A</figref>), the excess material <b>42</b> remains in its compact configuration. At a somewhat higher pressure P<b>2</b>&gt;P<b>1</b>, the excess material begins expanding, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9B</figref>. The amount of this expansion can be varied by varying the inflation pressure, so as to control the amount of additional expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>via expansion of excess material <b>42</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9C</figref> shows expansion member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>fully expanded, such as when a pressure P<b>3</b>&gt;P<b>2</b> or pressure higher than P<b>3</b> has been inputted to expandable member to cause a complete expansion of the excess material. The folds of the excess material <b>42</b> may be thicker and/or less compliant than the material that makes up the rest of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in order to provide the additional resistance to expansion. Alternatively, or additionally, the folds of the excess material may be partially and temporarily fixed together, such as by partial thermal bonding or other mechanism of adhesion, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0202\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10A-10F</figref> illustrate an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that is formed from a linear string of multiple expandable cells <b>46</b>, that can be inserted into the patient one at a time, thereby minimizing the inside diameter requirement of an introducer used to deliver the expandable cells <b>46</b>. Cells <b>46</b> may all be inflated together, substantially simultaneously. Alternatively, valves may be provided between the cells so that they can be sequentially, individually inflated. Further alternatively, the valves may allow sequential inflation, all at the same time with a single inflation step, but prevent loss of inflation media once it has entered the cells. Accordingly, if one cell fails and deflates, the remainder of the cells <b>46</b> remain fully inflated. Accordingly, this embodiment lends itself very well to percutaneous implantation procedures. Of course this embodiment could also be implanted using laparoscopic procedures or open surgical procedures, but it provides a particular advantage for use in percutaneous delivery, as noted. Typically the cells <b>46</b> are inflated after delivery into the abdominal cavity. However, the cells <b>46</b> may alternatively be inflated while outside of the patient&#39;s body and then inserted into the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0203\"> Cells <b>46</b> of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>are connected in fluid communication with one another via conduits <b>12</b> that connect adjacent cells <b>46</b>. Conduits <b>12</b> are flexible, so that the string or chain of cells <b>46</b> can be readily deformed and manipulated to assume a variety of shapes. One or more anchoring tabs <b>48</b> are provided extending from each cell <b>46</b>, but not in fluid communication with the cell <b>48</b>, so that these tabs <b>48</b> can be sutured through, tacked or stapled without losing pressure from the cell <b>46</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0204\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates a cartridge <b>50</b> that expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be delivered from during a percutaneous implantation, to deliver cells <b>46</b> into a patient&#39;s abdominal cavity. The cells <b>46</b> and interconnecting conduits <b>12</b> that form the long string of the expandable member are rolled or bunched up inside of cartridge <b>50</b> for subsequent one at a time delivery of cells <b>46</b> into the patient&#39;s anatomy. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10C</figref> shows an introducer <b>52</b> that is configured to receive cartridge <b>50</b> and advance the string of cells <b>46</b> one at a time therefrom for delivery thereof, as described below. After insertion of cartridge <b>50</b> into introducer <b>52</b>, as indicated by the arrow between <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10B and 10C</figref>, and formation of a small percutaneous opening into a patient&#39;s abdominal cavity (e.g., less than about 7 cm or less than about 6 cm or less than about 5 cm or less than about 4 cm or less than about 3 cm), the distal end of introducer <b>50</b> is inserted into the abdominal cavity and located adjacent a target surgical site where it is desired to fill space to restrict the expansion capacity of the stomach and/or to apply compression to the stomach, as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10D</figref>. Note that expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>has been arranged in the introducer so that the distal most tab <b>48</b> extends distally of the distal end of introducer <b>52</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0205\"> Upon positioning the distal end of introducer <b>52</b> at the target location, the distal most tab <b>48</b> can then be fixed to anchor the distal most cell in a desired location. Anchoring can be performed by stapling, tacking or suturing, for example, and can be to any structure adjacent the stomach <b>120</b>, but typically not to the stomach <b>120</b> itself. Typically, cells <b>46</b> will be stapled via tabs <b>48</b> to at least one of the diaphragm <b>116</b> and anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b>. With this initial fixation, the first (i.e., distal-most) cell <b>46</b> can be driven out of introducer <b>50</b>, such as by actuation of actuator <b>54</b>, for example. Alternatively, actuator <b>54</b> may be configured to install staples, tacks or sutures through tabs <b>48</b>, and cells <b>46</b> may be removed from introducer, by retracting the introducer proximally to draw the fixed cell <b>46</b> out of the distal end of the introducer, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20E</figref>. Cells <b>46</b> can be inflated individually after stapling or other fixation, or may all be inflated after finishing of the installation of all cells <b>46</b> to be used, or may be inflated prior to installing. The introducer can then be advanced distally again to the target location to anchor the next in line cell <b>46</b>. This process can be repeated until as many cells <b>46</b> have been anchored as necessary to fill the desired volume of space, as illustrated at <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10F</figref>. The cartridge of cells <b>46</b> does not have to be used entirely, as the surgeon can sever a link between adjacent cells <b>46</b> so as to tailor the number of cells <b>46</b> used in a particular procedure. The severed proximal end can then be caped or sewn shut (after any further inflation performed, if necessary), or connected in fluid communication with an access port <b>80</b>. When cells are provided with valves, as described above, no further inflation should be necessary after severing. Introducer <b>52</b> is then removed from the port and the port is closed, leaving a custom designed, custom-shaped expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in place, with the shape and volume being determined by the placement of the cells <b>46</b> and the number of cells <b>46</b> placed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0011\" num=\"0000\"> Implantation </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0207\" num=\"0206\"> As noted above, device <b>10</b> can be implanted so that, when expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is expanded to an expanded configuration, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can apply compression to the stomach <b>120</b> wall, or optionally only abut or lie adjacent to the pre-prandial stomach <b>120</b> wall, without imparting any significant deformation forces thereto. However, when the patient eats and the stomach begins to fill, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in either case prevents the stomach <b>120</b> from expanding into the volume occupied by expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Thus, either the stomach is initially \u201cdeformed\u201d by device <b>10</b>, or the stomach <b>120</b> becomes \u201cdeformed\u201d as it attempts to expand and can only expand in a limited fashion, if at all, around a portion of the perimeter of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>In either case, the stomach <b>120</b> is prevented from expanding to the extent that was possible prior to implantation of device <b>10</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0207\"> Thus, upon expanding the one or more expandable members, the device <b>10</b> expands in the space(s) normally occupied by the stomach <b>120</b> as the stomach <b>120</b> expands when receiving food. Thus device <b>10</b> exerts pressure on, or at least prevents expansion of the fundus and optionally, the antrum and/or portions of the stomach intermediate the fundus and antrum. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0209\" num=\"0208\"> As noted above, an expandable device <b>10</b> can be implanted adjacent a surface of the stomach wall, either in contact therewith or at a predetermined distance therefrom, to prevent expansion of the stomach <b>120</b> into a volume occupied by the expandable device <b>10</b>. Device <b>10</b> can be inserted, in a contracted or compressed configuration, so as to minimize the cross-sectional area of the device as it passes, through the skin of a patient, through the abdominal wall of the patient and into the abdominal cavity. This delivery may be accomplished percutaneously or laparoscopically, for example. Once in the abdominal cavity, device <b>10</b> is positioned in a space adjacent the stomach <b>120</b>, so as to fill the space and not compress the pre-prandial stomach, or alternatively to additionally provide some compression of the pre-prandial stomach, when expandable member(s) is/are expanded. As mentioned previously this positioning is to orient the device to generally follow the contours of the stomach <b>120</b> and surrounding organs, as the shape of device <b>10</b> is designed for the same. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0210\" num=\"0209\"> Once properly positioned, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is expanded, either by inflation or mechanical means, or both, to occupy the desired space in the abdominal cavity. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref> illustrate examples of devices <b>10</b> as properly positioned and in expanded configurations. Thus, expansion of at least one expandable member accomplishes at least one of: prevention of expansion of the stomach <b>120</b> of the patient into the space occupied by expanded device <b>10</b>; and compression of a portion of the stomach <b>120</b> by expanded device <b>10</b>. Device <b>10</b> may be anchored to one or more structures in the abdominal cavity. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a device <b>10</b> having been inserted into the abdominal cavity in a manner as described, and expandable member <b>10</b>em having been inflated. Any of the devices <b>10</b>/expandable members <b>10</b>em described herein may be provided with one or more anchoring tabs <b>150</b> attached thereto. In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, anchoring tabs <b>150</b> have been bonded to the surface of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>such as with a silicone room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) adhesive, for example. Tabs <b>150</b> may also have material thereon that encourages tissue ingrowth to provide permanent fixation of tabs <b>150</b> to the anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b> or other interior abdominal structure, to fortify the fixation provided by staples, sutures, tacks or the like. Alternatively, a single tab <b>150</b> can be placed around expandable member <b>10</b>em to extend from and cover all of the areas covered by the three tabs <b>150</b> shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>. It would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that other combinations of number of and shapes of tabs <b>150</b> could be substituted. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0211\" num=\"0210\"> Tabs <b>150</b> are anchored to a structure (other than the stomach) in the abdominal cavity to maintain the desired positioning and orientation of device <b>10</b> relative to the stomach <b>120</b>. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, tabs <b>150</b> have been attached to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> via sutures, staples, tacks or the like <b>154</b> to fix tabs <b>150</b> with respect to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Port <b>90</b> is shown anchored to the opposite (external) side of the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0212\" num=\"0211\"> Further, additionally or alternatively, a portion <b>156</b> of the surface of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that does not come into contact with stomach <b>120</b> can be roughened or provided with some porosity (wherein the porosity does not extend all the way through the wall of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i>) to promote adhesion and/or tissue ingrowth for anchoring device <b>10</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0213\" num=\"0212\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12K</figref> illustrate steps that may be carried out during a procedure for percutaneously implanting an expandable extra-gastric device <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Prior to making an incision, the local area (the area of the skin in and surrounding the location where the incision is to be made) may be prepared by disinfecting with alcohol and or betadine. Additionally, the patient may be given a mild sedative or may be on conscious sedation. Though not preferred, the procedure can also be carried out under general anesthesia. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0214\" num=\"0213\"> Next a powerful local anesthetic such as marcaine (bupivicaine) or other powerful anesthetic, optionally mixed with an epinephrine or other vasoconstrictor to reduce any bleeding that might result from mild trauma can be injected into the local area through the skin <b>125</b> of the patient <b>1</b> down to the muscular layer and to infiltrate the fat layer and entire local area (the anesthetic portion of the mixture may not be needed if the procedure is performed under general anesthesia). Injection may be performed using a syringe <b>219</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>, or other injection tool. After allowing time for the injected anesthesia to take effect, a small incision <b>223</b> is made in the skin <b>125</b> of the patient <b>1</b>, with a scalpel <b>229</b> or other surgical cutting tool, in the local area over the surgical target area where device <b>10</b> is to be implanted. Optionally, in the example shown, the incision <b>223</b> is made slightly inferior to the lower rib line <b>114</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref> shows a frontal schematic view of the abdominal portion of the patient <b>1</b>). Alternatively, a needle (e.g., veress needle <b>501</b>) can be inserted, without the need to make the incision <b>223</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12L</figref>. A conventional veress needle does not have a lumen for a guidewire. By adding a small sheath outside the shaft of the veress needle apparatus, a modified veress needle is created such that a guidewire <b>502</b> can be easily introduced through the sheath. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12L</figref> further illustrate that the location of insertion in well below the xiphoid, to the left of midline, near the palpated edge of the costal cartilages. It is noted that in the alternative method illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>, that incision <b>223</b> can also be made in this location. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0215\" num=\"0214\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12B</figref> shows an access sheath or cannula <b>535</b> being inserted to guide delivery and placement of device <b>10</b> and anchoring during later steps of the procedure described below. A trocar <b>536</b> (shown in phantom lines in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12B</figref>) may optionally be inserted along with insertion of sheath/cannula <b>535</b> in order to facilitate formation of a pathway into which sheath/cannula <b>535</b> is inserted, and then removed from the sheath prior to insertion of any other objects such as device <b>10</b>, instruments, etc. Insertion of the sheath/cannula <b>535</b> can be performed without any additional visualization provided (i.e., just by eyesight), or may be guided by use of an endoscope <b>537</b> (shown in phantom lines) and/or with fluoroscopic visualization. If endoscope <b>537</b> is used, trocar <b>536</b> is removed after partial insertion of sheath/cannula <b>535</b> and then endoscope is inserted through sheath/cannula <b>535</b> to guide the remaining insertion to be performed, and particularly, the final placement of sheath/cannula <b>535</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0216\" num=\"0215\"> Once sheath/cannula <b>535</b> has been properly placed to the satisfaction of the surgeon (e.g., in one example, sheatb/cannula <b>535</b> is inserted into a region about three to four inches below the level of the inferior border of the liver <b>121</b> at or immediately to the right of midline) the same anesthetic or mixture of anesthetics used to numb the incision site prior to making the initial incision <b>223</b> can be injected into the abdomen through cannula/sheath <b>535</b> to numb the site interiorly of the abdominal wall. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0217\" num=\"0216\"> Next, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12C</figref>, a guidewire <b>502</b> is inserted through cannula/sheath <b>535</b>. Guidewire <b>502</b> may be inserted under fluoroscopic visualization, 3-D RF or electromagnetic visualization (e.g., using preexisting or real-time data sets from MRI, cat scan, three-dimensional ultrasound, or other three-dimensional data set, etc.) or blindly to pass around the stomach <b>120</b> so that it rides against the diaphragm <b>116</b> and is thereby guided along the diaphragm <b>116</b> until reaching or closely approaching the spleen <b>128</b>. Alternatively, a rod may be inserted instead of guidewire <b>502</b>, wherein the rod is stiffer than guidewire <b>502</b> and/or have variable regions of stiffness or flexibility greater than those of guidewire <b>502</b>. Additionally, the rod may have a lager cross-sectional area than guidewire <b>502</b> and optionally may have one or more lumens therethrough for delivery of suction, irrigation, injection of other fluids, injection of medicaments, etc. The rod may be inserted in similar manner to guidewire <b>502</b> by may be less likely to kink. The rod may be pre-shaped to more rigidly define a course of travel of device <b>10</b> that it guides, relative to use of the guidewire <b>502</b>, which is typically flexible. Optionally, a flexible endoscope can be inserted through cannula/sheath <b>535</b> to visualize guidewire or rod <b>502</b> and confirm that it has been properly placed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0218\" num=\"0217\"> Once properly placed, an anchoring frame <b>600</b> and an anchoring frame delivery tool <b>630</b> on which anchoring frame <b>600</b> is mounted (in a manner as described in greater detail below) are advanced over guidewire <b>502</b> and into sheath/cannula <b>535</b> (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12D</figref>) after which anchoring frame delivery tool <b>630</b> is operated to deliver anchoring frame <b>600</b> into the target position along the abdominal wall, where it is anchored there. Prior to anchoring, the surgeon will check to ensure that no bowel, omentum or other tissue is located between the anchoring frame <b>600</b>/tool <b>630</b> and the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. After anchoring the anchoring frame <b>600</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, anchoring frame delivery tool is then removed from sheath/cannula <b>535</b> and off guidewire <b>502</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12E</figref> illustrates a sectional view of the patient <b>1</b> (viewed from the feet of the patient) that shows the anchoring of anchoring frame <b>600</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, with the anchoring frame delivery tool <b>630</b> having been removed. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12F</figref> is a schematic illustration from a frontal view perspective, like those of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12D</figref>, showing the anchoring frame <b>600</b> anchored in place against the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, as also shown in the sectional view of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12E</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0219\" num=\"0218\"> Once anchoring frame has been anchored to the target location, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12E and 12F</figref>, a device deployment tool <b>660</b> having already been preloaded with a device <b>10</b> in a collapsed or compressed configuration, is next advanced over the guidewire <b>502</b> and over anchoring frame <b>600</b> in a manner described in greater detail below. Positioning of the device <b>10</b> can be monitored during this delivery using fluoroscopy, X-ray, CT or MRI visualization guidance, for example, or simply via direct visualization with an endoscope, such as a flexible endoscope inserted through sheath/cannula <b>535</b>, for example. Alternatively an endoscope may be inserted into device deployment tool <b>660</b> or other tool to perform such viewing, or an endoscope can be inserted through an additional opening through the patient accessing the abdominal cavity. Device <b>10</b> is advanced to the end of anchoring frame where it automatically locks into position there. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12G</figref> shows a sectional illustration of device <b>10</b> having been locked into position on anchoring frame <b>600</b>, with device delivery tool <b>660</b> having been removed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0220\" num=\"0219\"> At this stage, when the surgeon is satisfied that device <b>10</b> has been properly positioned and locked to anchoring frame <b>600</b>, cannula/sheath <b>535</b> and guidewire <b>502</b> are both removed. For devices <b>10</b> that include one or more inflatable expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>at least one conduit <b>12</b> will remain extending from device <b>10</b>, proximally out through the incision <b>223</b> having been made in the patient. The one or more conduits <b>12</b> can then be used to inflate the one or more expandable members. For devices that do not include an inflatable expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>a conduit <b>12</b> is not necessarily required, although there may be one present, depending upon the type of mechanically expandable member(s) that is/are used. For example, a conduit may be provided to insert a wire therethrough to mechanically expand the expandable member <b>10</b>em. Otherwise, if a conduit <b>12</b> is not included, then the one or more expandable members are expanded in a manner as has already been described. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0221\" num=\"0220\"> Getting back to devices <b>10</b> having at least one inflatable expandable member, one or more expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em </i>may be inflated at this stage to test the amount of displacement and positioning of the device when in an expanded configuration, which may help to determine whether device <b>10</b> will perform as intended. One method of testing in this manner is with the use of an intra-gastric sizing device <b>310</b> (e.g. an intra-gastric balloon catheter) in a manner as described in application Ser. No. 11/407,701. Additionally, or alternatively, testing may be performed by visually observing the effects of expansion, such as by inputting radiopaque fluid into the stomach <b>120</b>, and/or by observing the expansion of the device when it is provided with one or more radiopaque indicators, as has already been described previously. Visualization, in such instances may be performed fluoroscopically or with other X-ray visualization, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0222\" num=\"0221\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12H</figref> illustrates expansion of a first expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>using pressurized gas, for example. At this time, an intra-gastric sizing device may optionally be already in position, and typically is placed and inflated to the desired size prior to expanding expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>. For devices having only one expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>expansion of this expandable member would then be performed to accomplish the desired amount of space restriction as indicated by feedback from intra-gastric sizing device <b>130</b>, for example. In the example shown, where two expandable members are provided, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>is typically inflated to a predetermined pressure where it has been determined that the expandable member has not expanded or stretched to a degree where the leakage rate of gas through the member is unacceptable. Typically, a maximum pressure will have been predetermined where the leakage rate is not excessive, and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>will not be expanded by a pressure that is greater than this maximum pressure. If the resulting degree of expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>does not provide sufficient displacement, then the second expandable member is expanded, such as by inputting pressurized liquid into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, to expand it until sufficient displacement has been achieved, such as confirmed by visualization and/or feedback from intra-gastric sizing device, for example, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12I</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0223\" num=\"0222\"> At this time, conduits <b>12</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>12</b> <sub>2 </sub>can be either clamped off to maintain the pressures within expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, or the pressures can be released, thereby allowing expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>. It is easier procedurally to release the pressures and so this is typically done. However, the surgeon may choose to clamp off the conduits to maintain at least partial pressures in the expandable members to ensure that they maintain the observed positions. In any case, conduit(s) <b>12</b> are next trimmed to an appropriate length for connection with an adjustment member <b>80</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12J</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0224\" num=\"0223\"> Conduit(s) <b>12</b> are then connected to a mating connector on adjustment member <b>80</b> or to a deployment tool <b>370</b> configured to mate conduit <b>12</b> with adjustment member <b>80</b>, and, after connection of conduit <b>12</b> to adjustment member <b>80</b>, adjustment member deployment tool <b>370</b> is then used to anchor adjustment member <b>80</b> to the patient. By advancing deployment tool <b>370</b> into the patient, the portion of conduit that had extended from the patient <b>1</b> is pushed back into the patient, until the adjustment member is positioned in the target location where it is intended to be anchored. This positioning can be verified using any of the previously described visualization techniques, or can be performed blindly, with feedback from palpitation, for example. In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12K</figref>, adjustment member <b>80</b> is anchored subcutaneously, to the external surface of the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. As has been disclosed previously, adjustment member <b>80</b> can alternatively be anchored subcutaneously, to an inner layer of the skin for example, or otherwise in the fat layer <b>131</b> without being anchored directly to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Once adjustment member <b>80</b> has been anchored in the desired location, deployment tool <b>370</b> is withdrawn and the one or more expandable members are reinflated, if they had been previously deflated, or topped off, if the conduits <b>12</b> were clamped to maintain some pressure, to return the one or more expandable members to their desired sizes. In this way, the patient can begin to experience beneficial weight loss from the effects of device <b>10</b> on the stomach <b>120</b> beginning immediately after completion of the procedure, unlike current procedures, which typically require around six weeks before a return visit to \u201ccomplete\u201d the procedure to make it effective in helping weight loss. The same type or types of monitoring can be used here, as described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12H-12I</figref>, to provide feedback as to when the one or more expandable members have been expanded by the desired amount. Alternatively, one or more of the one or more expandable members may be left in an unexpanded configuration, with the patient being allowed to heal and then return to have the expandable members(s) inflated. Further alternatively, device <b>10</b> may be implanted in combination with a constricting band, such as the LapBand\u2122 or similar implant to improve results from such constricting band, or to make weight loss efficacious where prior implantation of such a constricting band has not been efficacious. For example, a constricting band generally useful for restricting the amount of solid food ingested by the patient <b>1</b>. However, a patient <b>1</b> may \u201ccheat\u201d the effectiveness of a constricting band approach by drinking high caloric liquids, for example. For example, a patient could drink a thirty-two ounce milkshake and this would pass right through the constriction established by the constricting band. However, with device <b>10</b> implanted and expanded as described, the stomach is preventing from expanding, even by high caloric liquids. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0225\" num=\"0224\"> Once the surgeon is satisfied that the expandable member(s) have been expanded by the desired amount, or if the expandable members(s) are to be left in a contracted (unexpanded or partially expanded) state, the patient is closed, including, suturing the skin <b>125</b> at the site of the incision <b>223</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0226\" num=\"0225\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12L-12N</figref> illustrate variations in the percutaneous procedure described above that can be alternatively performed. As already noted above, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12L</figref> schematically illustrates percutaneous insertion of a guidewire through a needle <b>501</b>, wherein the incision and sheath insertion steps of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref> need not be carried out. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12M</figref> illustrates the insertion of guidewire <b>502</b> to follow the contour of the caudal surface of the diaphragm as it is pushed up and around the stomach <b>120</b>, as far as the spleen, like described in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12C</figref> above. The distal end of guidewire <b>502</b> may be provided in a \u201cJ\u201d shape or other bent shape to make it more atraumatic. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0227\" num=\"0226\"> Once the guidewire <b>502</b> has been placed as desired, needle <b>501</b> is pulled off of guidewire <b>502</b> and removed. A port <b>535</b> (similar to a laparoscopic port or other access sheath or cannula <b>535</b> is then inserted through the opening made by needle <b>501</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12N</figref>. Installation of anchoring frame <b>600</b>, device <b>10</b> and access member <b>80</b> may then be performed as described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12D-12K</figref>. In another variation regarding expanding expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>for a device <b>10</b> having two expandable members, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>may be expanded with gas after the access member <b>80</b> is installed/anchored, and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>may be expanded with fluid, after completion of the procedure and some passage of time (e.g., during a follow-up visit). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0228\" num=\"0227\"> Any of the variations of the procedure described above may be executed under fluoroscopic visualization, 3-dimensional navigation or other CT/MRI guidance. Further alternatively, any of these procedures may be performed as mini laparoscopic procedures (e.g., where the entire abdominal space is not insufflated, but only a small portion is and general anesthesia is not used; or where at least one of the steps involving insertion into the abdominal cavity is performed without direct visualization provided by an endoscope, for example. Anchoring of anchoring frame <b>600</b> may be performed as a separate step of the procedure, as shown and described above, or, alternatively, may be combined with the device <b>10</b> insertion and positioning part of the procedure, wherein the act of sliding the device <b>10</b> over the anchoring frame drives the anchoring of the anchoring frame <b>600</b> at the same time that device <b>10</b> is positioned (slid) thereon. All tools referenced in the above procedure may include lumens to permit insertion of other tools and/or devices therethrough, including, but not limited to: endoscopes, wires, etc. and/or to allow delivery of suction, irrigation, and/or other substances. Alternatively to mounting the adjustment member <b>80</b> to conduit <b>12</b> in any of the manners described above, adjustment member may be pre-attached or integral with conduit <b>12</b>. As already noted previously, device <b>10</b> may include one or more chambers (expandable members) and may also contain fluids, gases, structural members, foams and/or other space occupying materials. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0229\" num=\"0228\"> Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, an embodiment of an anchoring frame <b>600</b> is illustrated that can be used for anchoring a device <b>10</b> in the abdominal space, such as, but not limited to the manner described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12K</figref>, for example. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of anchoring frame in an undeployed configuration, i.e., when anchors <b>102</b> have not been deployed to anchor the anchoring frame. In the undeployed configuration, anchoring frame <b>600</b> has a contact surface <b>604</b> that is configured, shaped and dimensioned to conform to a tissue surface in the abdominal cavity to which the anchoring frame <b>600</b> is to be anchored. Openings <b>606</b> are provided that extend from an inner surface of anchoring frame, through the wall on which the contact surface <b>604</b> is formed, and through the contact surface <b>604</b>. Openings <b>606</b> are arranged for delivery of anchors <b>602</b> therethrough and are thus aligned with anchors <b>602</b> as will be described in greater detail below. Although shown as substantially straight, anchoring frame and contact surface <b>604</b> may have a curvature that is formed to follow the general contour of the structure in the abdominal cavity that it is to be anchored to. Thus, for example, for anchoring to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> in the procedure describe above, anchoring frame <b>600</b> and contact surface <b>604</b> are curved to conform to the contour of the abdominal wall <b>127</b> just below the diaphragm <b>116</b>. Thus, the curvature (or straightness) of the anchoring frame <b>600</b> and contact surface <b>604</b> is dictated by the contour of the tissue surface that it is intended to be anchored to. Thus, anchoring frame <b>600</b> can be substantially rigid and shaped with a predefined curvature (or shape) of contact surface <b>604</b> to match that of the tissue surface that it is to be anchored to. Alternatively, and preferably, anchoring frame may be flexible, so that when compressive forces are applied to it, by applying a force distally to the proximal end of anchoring frame <b>600</b>, such as with anchoring frame deployment tool <b>630</b>, for example, while the distal end of anchoring frame is fixed, such as by being abutted up against a ball end of a guidewire, for example, the compressive force causes the frame <b>600</b> and contact surface <b>604</b> to bend and thereby abut against the surface of the tissue to be anchored to. Frame <b>600</b> and surface <b>604</b> may be structurally biased so as to be predisposed to bending in one direction away from the longitudinal axis of the frame <b>600</b>, as opposed to bending in the opposite direction, to ensure that the contact surface bows out in the direction where it will contact the tissue structure to which it is to be anchored. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0230\" num=\"0229\"> Within the channel <b>608</b> are positioned a series of anchors <b>610</b> such as staples, tacks, spikes or other sharpened mechanical member configured to be driven into the tissue and to maintain anchoring within the tissue after piercing it. The staples of other sharpened mechanical members are positioned in frame <b>600</b> in small channels and are completely retracted so as not to extend through surface <b>604</b> as frame <b>600</b> is being delivered into the abdominal cavity. A deployment member <b>612</b> is provided within anchoring frame <b>600</b> that is configured for deploying the anchors. Deployment member <b>612</b> includes an enlarged driver <b>613</b> located distally of anchors <b>10</b>, and a cable or wire <b>614</b> that extends proximally from drive <b>613</b> and out the proximal end of anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Cable/wire <b>614</b> has sufficient length so that when anchoring frame is placed in position on the target area in the abdominal cavity to which it is to be anchored, the proximal end portion of cable/wire <b>614</b> still extends out of the patient <b>1</b> (such as out of the incision <b>223</b> in the procedure described above, for example). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0231\" num=\"0230\"> When frame <b>600</b> is positioned in the abdominal cavity at the target location where it is to be anchored, e.g., against the abdominal wall, frame <b>600</b> is held motionless against the target area while deployment member is retracted proximally. If frame <b>600</b> is a flexible frame, constant pressure is exerted in a distal direction against the frame to ensure that it remains buckled/bent against the target area, so that it conforms to and contacts the target surface (e.g., abdominal wall). By pulling on cable/wire <b>614</b> while holding frame <b>600</b> substantially motionless, deployment driver <b>613</b> is retracted proximally through channel <b>608</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13C</figref>. As it is retracted, driver <b>613</b> contacts anchors <b>610</b> driving them out through openings <b>606</b> and into the tissue, thereby anchoring frame <b>600</b> to the tissue as desired. Upon completely withdrawing deployment member <b>614</b>/driver <b>613</b>, and open channel <b>608</b> is then provided for guiding one or more keys provided on a device <b>10</b> that are slidable in channel and are configured to be prevented from pulling through the slot at the bottom of the channel <b>608</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0232\" num=\"0231\"> To further enhance anchoring of frame <b>600</b>, all of a portion of surface <b>604</b> may be covered with an ingrowth layer <b>616</b>, such as a fabric layer (e.g., polyethylene terepthalate or other porous, biocompatible fabric) or other porous layer configured to encourage tissue ingrowth. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0233\" num=\"0232\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates an example of a device <b>10</b> provided with keys <b>618</b> configured to slide within channel <b>608</b> while being prevented from sliding out through slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i>Thus, keys <b>608</b> are generally matching to the cross-sectional configuration of channel <b>608</b>, while each having a neck portion <b>618</b> <i>n </i>of narrower dimension that is configured to slide within slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14B</figref> shows an end view of key <b>618</b> inserted into channel <b>608</b> of frame <b>600</b>. Alternatively, key <b>618</b> need not have a cross sectional shape that matches the cross-sectional shape of channel <b>608</b>, as long as the enlarged portion of key <b>618</b> is too large to pass through slot <b>618</b> <i>s, </i>yet small enough to slide within channel <b>608</b>, and neck <b>618</b> <i>n </i>is of small enough dimension to slight through slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14C</figref> shows an example of a key <b>618</b> wherein the enlarged portion is spherically shaped. Keys <b>618</b> are not limited to the shapes described but can take on virtually any cross-sectional shape, as long as the requirements in size described above are met, relative to cooperating with channel <b>608</b> and slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i>Of course, some cross-sectional shapes are more advantageous than others with regard to functionality, such as minimizing resistance/friction between the keys <b>618</b> and channel <b>608</b> as device <b>10</b> is deployed over frame <b>600</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0234\" num=\"0233\"> The number of keys <b>618</b> attached to device <b>10</b> is also variable and may vary from one up to several dozen. Lengths of the keys (relative to the longitudinal axis of frame <b>600</b>) can also be a variety of sizes, up to and including, a continuous key that extends over the full length of channel <b>608</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14D</figref> illustrates the device <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14A</figref> having been mounted on anchoring frame <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>. Of course, during the insertion of device <b>10</b> into the abdominal cavity target area, device <b>10</b> will typically be in a compact, collapsed configuration to minimize its size during the delivery and as it is mounted on anchoring frame <b>600</b>. An exception may be in a situation where device <b>10</b> is implanted using an open procedure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0235\" num=\"0234\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an anchoring frame <b>600</b> that employs a rail configuration for receiving a device thereover. Anchoring frame <b>600</b> is constructed similarly to any of the variations described above with regard to frame <b>600</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-13D</figref>, including the contact surface <b>604</b>, optional ingrowth layer <b>616</b>, anchors <b>610</b>, and openings <b>606</b>. Frame <b>600</b> is installable over a removable wire, such as guidewire <b>502</b>, for example, with the wire being removable after completion of the procedure. In this arrangement, however, rather than having a channel <b>608</b> to slidably receive one or more keys <b>618</b>, rail or beam <b>618</b> functions as a key with respect to a channel or groove <b>608</b> formed in device <b>10</b> that slides over rail or beam <b>618</b>. As with the keys <b>618</b> on device <b>10</b>, the rail or beam <b>618</b> need not be T-shaped in cross-section, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref>, as long as the enlarged portion of rail <b>618</b> is too large to pass through slot <b>608</b>s in the channel <b>608</b> of device <b>10</b>, yet small enough to slide within channel <b>608</b>, and neck <b>618</b> <i>n </i>is of small enough dimension to slide through slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i>Likewise channel <b>608</b> need not be T-shaped in cross section, but may have some other cross-section shape that forms an enlarged portion to slide within channel <b>608</b> and is impassable through slot <b>608</b> <i>s, </i>and a neck portion <b>618</b> <i>n </i>that is slidable within slot <b>608</b> <i>s. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0236\" num=\"0235\"> In order to deploy anchors <b>610</b> into the tissue to anchor the anchoring frame <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref>, deployment member <b>612</b> in this case is provided to slide over rail <b>618</b> as illustrated in the end view of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15B</figref> (anchors <b>610</b> are not shown, for simplicity of illustration, since the mechanism for driving the anchors <b>610</b> by driver <b>613</b> is the same as that described with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref> above). Deployment member <b>612</b> includes an enlarged driver <b>613</b> that is located in the channels formed on both sides of neck <b>616</b>n that is located distally of anchors <b>610</b>, prior to deployment, and a cable or wire <b>614</b> that extends proximally from driver <b>613</b> and out the proximal end of anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Cable/wire <b>614</b> has sufficient length so that when anchoring frame is placed in position on the target area in the abdominal cavity to which it is to be anchored, the proximal end portion of cable/wire <b>614</b> still extends out of the patient <b>1</b> (such as out of the incision <b>223</b> in the procedure described above, for example). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0237\" num=\"0236\"> When frame <b>600</b> is positioned in the abdominal cavity at the target location where it is to be anchored, e.g., against the abdominal wall, frame <b>600</b> is held motionless against the target area while deployment member is retracted proximally. If frame <b>600</b> is a flexible frame, constant pressure is exerted in a distal direction against the frame to ensure that it remains buckled/bent against the target area, so that it conforms to and contacts the target surface (e.g., abdominal wall). By pulling on cable/wire <b>614</b> while holding frame <b>600</b> substantially motionless, deployment driver <b>613</b> is retracted proximally to slide along rail <b>618</b>. As it is retracted, driver <b>613</b> contacts anchors <b>610</b> on both sides of neck <b>618</b> <i>n, </i>thereby driving them out through openings <b>606</b> and into the tissue, thereby anchoring frame <b>600</b> to the tissue as desired. Upon completely withdrawing deployment member <b>614</b>/driver <b>613</b>, rail is then unobscured by driver <b>613</b>, so that the channel <b>608</b> of device <b>10</b> can be slid thereover. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0238\" num=\"0237\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15C</figref> shows an end view of device <b>10</b> having one configuration (T-shaped cross-section) of channel <b>608</b> configured to slide over rail <b>618</b> to secure device <b>10</b> to anchoring frame <b>600</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15D</figref> shows device <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15C</figref> having been mounted on anchoring frame <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15A-15B</figref>. Note that channel <b>608</b> can extend over a length of device <b>10</b> that is much greater than the length of frame <b>600</b>, to provide guidance of delivery of the distal end of the device, even though the distal end of device <b>10</b> is not engaged with frame <b>600</b> when device <b>10</b> has been installed in the intended position as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15D</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0239\" num=\"0238\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15E</figref> is a schematic, sectional illustration (viewed from the foot of the patient with the patient lying on his back) of device <b>10</b> anchored to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> via anchoring frame <b>600</b>, with device <b>10</b> shown in an expanded configuration. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0240\" num=\"0239\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an anchoring frame <b>600</b> that includes an actuation mechanism that can be use to anchor the frame <b>600</b> to tissue (deploy) as well as to release the frame <b>600</b> from such anchoring. In this case, deployment member <b>612</b> is provided in a channel <b>608</b> above a rail <b>618</b> that is configured to receive device <b>10</b> thereover, and deployment member <b>612</b> is configured to not only anchor the frame <b>600</b> to a tissue surface, but is also operable to reverse this anchoring, so as to allow removal or repositioning and re-anchoring of frame <b>600</b>. Thus, the enlarged members or drivers <b>613</b> of deployment member <b>612</b> include deployment driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>a </i>and retraction driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref>. Upon sliding deployment member <b>612</b> relative to frame <b>600</b> in a direction to contact deployment driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>a </i>with anchors <b>610</b> (i.e., to the left, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref>) and continuing to slide deployment member <b>612</b> in that direction, deployment driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>a </i>drive anchors to rotate so as to extend the sharp (distal) ends of anchors out of openings <b>606</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16B</figref>. Deployment driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>a </i>are abrupt or steep and may even be formed as substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of frame <b>600</b>. Retraction driver surfaces <b>613</b> <i>b </i>are ramped or cammed so as to allow the rotation of the opposite (proximal) ends down into channel <b>608</b> without contacting deployment member <b>612</b> during deployment of the distal ends. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0241\" num=\"0240\"> Thus, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates anchors <b>610</b> in the deployed configuration, wherein, when contact surface <b>604</b> is contacted to a tissue surface and anchors <b>610</b> are deployed in this manner, this anchors frame <b>600</b> to the tissue. Should the operator wish to remove anchoring frame <b>600</b>, or reposition it, deployment member <b>612</b> is slid in the opposite direction relative to frame <b>600</b> (i.e., to the right in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16B</figref>). This causes retraction driver surfaces to contact the proximal ends <b>610</b> <i>p </i>of anchors <b>610</b>, and continued movement of deployment member <b>612</b> causes drivers <b>613</b> <i>p </i>to reverse rotate anchors <b>610</b> to the positions shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref>. These deployment and retraction functions are repeatable. That is, after retracting the anchors <b>610</b> as described, anchoring frame can be repositioned on a tissue surface, and deployment member <b>612</b> can be actuated again to deploy anchors <b>610</b> and thereby anchor the frame <b>600</b> to the new location. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0242\" num=\"0241\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16C</figref> illustrates a tool <b>625</b> configured to engage with deployment member <b>612</b> and anchoring frame <b>600</b> and, when engaged, can be used to move, orient and position anchoring frame, as well as operate deployment member <b>612</b> to deploy anchors <b>610</b> and/or retract anchors <b>610</b>. Tool <b>625</b> includes an elongated shaft <b>627</b> having sufficient length so that when tool <b>625</b> is engaged with anchoring frame <b>600</b> and deployment member <b>612</b> in a manner as described hereafter, a proximal end portion of tool <b>625</b>, including actuators to be manipulated by a surgeon or other user, extend out of the body of the patient <b>1</b>, even when frame <b>600</b> has been inserted into the abdominal cavity as far as it needs to be advanced to anchor it at a desired location. The distal end of tool <b>625</b> includes a quick release mechanism <b>628</b> configured to engage with engagement features <b>615</b> on a proximal end portion of anchoring frame <b>600</b>. For example, quick release mechanism <b>628</b> may include a plurality of hooks or teeth <b>628</b> <i>h </i>that engage with engagement features <b>615</b> provided as mating or interengaging hooks to teeth. The hooks or teeth <b>628</b> <i>h </i>can be drawn toward one another, radially inwardly, such as by rotation of quick release actuator <b>629</b>, for example, so that they no longer engage with engagement members <b>615</b>, but can be slid therepast, quickly releasing tool <b>625</b> from anchoring frame <b>600</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0243\" num=\"0242\"> A cam driver <b>629</b> is formed at a distal end of a cam driver shaft <b>629</b>d that is axially drivable with respect to shaft <b>627</b> by pivoting cam driver actuator <b>631</b> relative to shaft <b>627</b>. A slidable safety lock <b>633</b> may be provided on shaft <b>627</b> that is slidable in a first direction to prevent pivoting of actuator <b>631</b> relative to shaft <b>627</b>, thereby preventing inadvertent deployment or retraction of anchors <b>610</b> when cam driver <b>629</b> of tool <b>625</b> is engaged with deployment member <b>612</b>, such as by engagement with cam driver engagement member <b>612</b> <i>c, </i>for example. By sliding safety lock <b>633</b> in the opposite direction, this unlocks actuator <b>631</b> and the operator can then either pivot actuator <b>631</b> toward shaft <b>627</b> to drive deployment member <b>612</b> to deploy anchors <b>610</b>, or pivot actuator <b>631</b> away from shaft <b>627</b> to retract anchors into anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Upon quick release of tool <b>625</b> from frame <b>600</b> as described, cam driver <b>629</b> can be released from cam drive engagement member <b>612</b>c by simply rotating tool <b>625</b> about its longitudinal axis so that cam driver <b>629</b> and engagement member <b>612</b> <i>c </i>become misaligned. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0244\" num=\"0243\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an anchoring frame deployment tool <b>630</b> that can be used for percutaneous delivery of anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Tool <b>630</b> includes a handle <b>632</b> for manual operation by a user (e.g., surgeon) and an elongated, rigid shaft <b>634</b> extending distally therefrom. An engagement feature <b>636</b> is provided on shaft <b>636</b> for engaging with anchoring frame and securing it during the delivery thereof. For example, engagement feature may be a rail, e.g., a t-shaped rail or other cross sectional configuration that slides within a channel in frame <b>600</b>, somewhat like a tongue-and-groove fitting, or may include a channel that slides over a rail portion of frame <b>600</b>, etc. An actuator <b>638</b> is provided on handle <b>632</b> that is actuatable to trigger staples or other mechanical members <b>610</b> to be driven through the openings in frame <b>600</b> to extend through the surface <b>604</b> and into the target internal abdominal structure (e.g., abdominal wall) to anchor frame <b>600</b> thereto. One or more lumens may be provided through shaft <b>634</b> for delivery of irrigating fluids (or other substances) and for application of suction to the distal end of shaft <b>634</b>, via ports <b>640</b> and <b>642</b>, respectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0245\" num=\"0244\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an anchoring frame deployment tool <b>630</b> that is configured to receive an endoscope <b>537</b> therein to facilitate viewing of the placement of anchoring frame <b>600</b>. A video camera <b>538</b> may be provided on endoscope <b>537</b> so as to monitor the visualization on a screen, or, optionally, viewing may be performed directly through an ocular. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0246\" num=\"0245\"> Shaft <b>634</b> articulates, via one or more articulating joints <b>644</b>. An articulation actuator <b>646</b> is provided on or near handle <b>630</b> for operation by a user to control the articulation of a distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>of shaft <b>634</b> with respect to a proximal portion <b>634</b> <i>p </i>of shaft <b>634</b>. In the example shown, articulation actuator <b>646</b> is a rotatable wheel that is rotatable in a first direction to articulate distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>in a first angular direction about joint <b>644</b>, while rotation of actuator <b>646</b> in the opposite direction articulates distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>in the opposite direction. Articulation actuator <b>646</b> and/or articulation joint <b>644</b> provide frictional resistance, so that when actuator <b>646</b> is not being rotated, distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>is maintained in its orientation relative to proximal portion <b>634</b> <i>p. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0247\" num=\"0246\"> A window or opening <b>648</b> is provided proximally of articulating joint <b>644</b> to enable viewing through the distal end of endoscope <b>537</b> that is positioned in shaft <b>634</b> at the location of opening/window <b>648</b> when endoscope <b>537</b> is inserted into tool <b>630</b>. Window/opening <b>648</b> may be an opening (e.g., cutout), or may be a window, e.g., a cutout that is sealed over with a transparent material. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0248\" num=\"0247\"> Distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>includes a recess or cavity <b>650</b> configured to receive anchoring frame <b>600</b> therein. Thus, recess or cavity <b>650</b> is shaped and dimensioned to receive anchoring frame <b>600</b> therein and to confine anchoring frame <b>600</b> from movements axially with respect to the longitudinal axis of distal portion <b>634</b>d. Frame <b>600</b> may be received in recess, cavity or slot <b>650</b> by friction fit and/or a releasable clamping mechanism (not shown, see co-pending Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 36A-36D</figref> and description thereof)) may be optionally provided on opposite sides of slot, recess or cavity <b>650</b> for releasably clamping frame <b>600</b> wherein it is received therein, with clamping and releasing motions being controlled by a clamp actuator (not shown, see co-pending Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 36A-36D</figref> and description thereof)). Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3) is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18B</figref> shows an enlarged partial view of shaft <b>634</b> with anchoring frame <b>600</b> mounted within distal end portion <b>634</b> <i>d, </i>and showing the distal end of endoscope <b>537</b> within proximal end portion <b>634</b> <i>p. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0249\" num=\"0248\"> In use, after insertion and placement of guidewire <b>502</b>, such as in a percutaneous procedure as described above, deployment tool <b>630</b> is passed over guidewire <b>502</b>, with the proximal end of guidewire first being inserted into the distal end of shaft <b>634</b>, through shaft <b>634</b> and handle <b>632</b> and proximally out of handle <b>632</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref>. By insertion of tool <b>630</b> into the abdominal cavity, the abdominal wall (e.g., the anterior abdominal wall can be directly visualized by endoscope <b>537</b>/camera <b>538</b> viewing through opening/window <b>648</b>. This visualization is performed to ensure that that is no tissue located between the anchoring site (e.g., anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b>) and anchoring frame <b>600</b> prior to anchoring the frame <b>600</b> to the anchoring site. Once it has been visually confirmed that there is no tissue intervening between frame <b>600</b> and the anchoring site, actuator <b>646</b> is manipulated to rotate distal portion <b>634</b> <i>d </i>up against the anchoring site, thereby contacting surface <b>604</b> to the anchoring site. Anchors <b>610</b> are then deployed into the anchoring site, such as by a mechanism described above for example. In an alternative embodiment, needles and sutures may be substituted for anchors <b>610</b>, such as described in Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 36C</figref> and description thereof). A deployment actuator <b>652</b>, such as a trigger, lever or other equivalent mechanical actuator can be provided on handle <b>632</b> for operation by the user. Thus when actuator <b>652</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref>) is actuated, this retracts enlarged member <b>613</b> to drive anchors <b>610</b> into the tissue, thereby anchoring the frame <b>600</b>. Deployment actuator may be provided with a safety mechanism or lock <b>654</b> that can be locked up until the time that the operator is ready to deploy the anchors <b>610</b>, to prevent inadvertent deployment of anchors <b>610</b> before the frame <b>600</b> has been properly positioned and is ready to be anchored. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0250\" num=\"0249\"> When device <b>10</b> has been fully inserted into its intended position relative to anchoring frame <b>600</b>, device is locked into this position by automatic lock <b>620</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19A-19B</figref> show one embodiment of an automatic lock <b>620</b> that may be provided on the proximal end of frame <b>600</b> on the underside of the top portion of track <b>618</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> show partial views of anchoring frame <b>600</b> with anchors <b>610</b> not being shown for simplicity of illustration. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19A</figref>, locks <b>620</b> are shown deployed. Locks <b>220</b> may be spring steel or some other biased members that are biased toward the deployed configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19A</figref>, while being deformable so as to lie substantially parallel or flush with the underside. Thus, when the channel <b>608</b> rides over the enlarged portion <b>618</b> at the bottom of the rail, in this case in a tongue and groove type of interfit, the top surfaces on opposite sides of slot <b>608</b> contact the undersurface <b>618</b> <i>u </i>of the top portion of the frame <b>600</b> and are guide therealong. As the top surfaces ride over automatic locks <b>620</b>, they depress them towards the undersurface so that the device is able to slide along the rail. Once the entire channel <b>608</b> of device <b>10</b> has passed locks <b>620</b> (distally thereof), locks resiliently spring back into the conformation shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19A</figref>, thereby preventing device <b>10</b> from being retracted proximally back off of frame <b>600</b>. Detents and/or other stopping structure (not shown) are provided at the distal end portion of the frame <b>600</b> to prevent channel <b>608</b> from being slid too far distally with respect to anchoring frame <b>600</b>/enlarged portion <b>618</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0251\" num=\"0250\"> Prior to anchoring the frame <b>600</b> to the desired target tissue, automatic locks are held recessed (in an unlocked configuration) against the undersurface <b>618</b>. This is necessary to allow the retraction of the enlarged member <b>613</b> of deployment member <b>612</b> during deployment of anchors <b>610</b>. For example, lock prevention tabs <b>622</b> may be inserted in slots <b>624</b> to maintain a biasing force on locks <b>620</b> to keep them in the unlocked configuration. Tabs <b>622</b> may be integrated, such as to form a U-shaped member like shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19B</figref> and a wire or suture <b>626</b> extends proximally therefrom and has a length sufficient to extend out of the patient <b>1</b>, even when frame <b>600</b> is located in its intended anchoring position. After enlarged member <b>613</b> has been retracted through frame <b>600</b> to drive anchors <b>610</b> into the target tissue, in a manner as already described above, and deployment member <b>612</b>/enlarged member <b>613</b> has been removed from anchoring frame <b>600</b>, the operator pulls on wire/suture <b>626</b>, thereby sliding tabs <b>622</b> out of their respective positions and removing tabs <b>622</b> form anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Upon this removal, locks <b>620</b> resiliently spring back into the locked configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19A</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0252\" num=\"0251\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20A</figref> shows an anchoring frame unlocking tool <b>670</b>, that can be used to unlock the anchoring frame to free device <b>10</b> that has been automatically locked into position along anchoring frame <b>600</b>. For example, it may be difficult to remove frame <b>600</b> if tissue has ingrown into tissue ingrowth surfaces provided on surface <b>604</b>, so this removal mechanism makes it much easier to remove the expandable member(s) <b>10</b> <i>em </i>for replacement, or withdrawal if no longer indicated. Tool <b>670</b> includes a handle <b>672</b>, and elongated shaft <b>674</b> and a lock depressor <b>676</b> at the distal end of shaft <b>674</b>. Lock depressor <b>676</b> is configured to be mounted and slide over rail <b>618</b> and includes depressor portions <b>676</b> <i>d </i>that extend above the portion that fits over rail <b>618</b> and that press against automatic locks <b>620</b> to depress them to the unlocked configuration as depressor <b>676</b> is slid over the rail <b>618</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20B</figref> shows an end view of tool <b>670</b> that illustrates a configuration of a lock depressor <b>676</b> according to one embodiment. Optionally, an actuator <b>678</b> may be provided to actuate the depressor portions form a retracted configuration to the extended configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20B</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0253\" num=\"0252\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20C</figref> schematically illustrates use of tool <b>670</b> to unlock device <b>10</b> from anchoring frame <b>600</b> so that device <b>10</b> can be removed from the site. Tool <b>670</b> is inserted (e.g., through incision <b>233</b> in the percutaneous procedures described above, or along any other approach provided by other procedures, such as mini-laparoscopic, laparoscopic, open, etc.) and lock depressor <b>676</b> is mounted over rail <b>618</b>. Tool <b>670</b> is then distally advanced over rail <b>618</b>. As lock depressor <b>676</b> advances distally, it depresses the automatic locks <b>620</b>, as shown. Upon full depression of locks <b>620</b>, or simply by distally advancing tool <b>670</b> until lock depressor <b>676</b> contacts the proximal end of channel <b>608</b> of the device <b>10</b>, device <b>10</b> is now ready to be removed off of frame <b>600</b>. By applying retraction force to conduit <b>12</b>, channel <b>608</b> slides proximally over channel <b>618</b>, thereby withdrawing device <b>10</b> and tool <b>670</b> together. Tool <b>670</b> may be operated to maintain contact with the proximal end of channel <b>608</b> to ensure that locks <b>620</b> remain unlocked as channel <b>608</b> is withdrawn thereover. In an alternate method, locks <b>620</b> may be formed with thin enough material so that an impulsive tug on conduit <b>12</b> is sufficient to bend locks <b>620</b> over backwards to allow channel <b>608</b> (and thus device <b>10</b>) to be withdrawn off of frame <b>600</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0254\" num=\"0253\"> As noted above, device <b>10</b> is provided in a compact (non-expanded) configuration during delivery, at least when delivering by a percutaneous, mini-laparoscopic or laparoscopic procedure. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of device <b>10</b> provided with looped tabs <b>682</b>, with one set <b>682</b> <i>a </i>extending lengthwise (e.g. relatively aligned along channel <b>608</b>) on one side of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>and an alternating set <b>60</b> <b>8</b> <i>b </i>on the opposite side of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>With expandable member in a deflated configuration, expandable member can be rolled in the direction indicated by arrows in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21A</figref> about its longitudinal axis, so that the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is rolled up on itself to form a compact structure resembling a cylinder. Once rolled up into this configuration, looped tabs <b>682</b> <i>a </i>and <b>682</b> <i>b </i>align with each other and a rod or wire <b>684</b> can be inserted through the loops of looped tabs <b>682</b> <i>a,</i> <b>682</b> <i>b </i>to maintain device <b>10</b> in the rolled up configuration, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21B</figref>. It is noted that channel <b>608</b> is still exposed on an external surface of the device even when in the rolled up condition, so that it can be mounted and slid over rail <b>618</b> during the delivery of device <b>10</b>. Once device <b>10</b> has been positioned over frame <b>600</b>/rail <b>618</b> in the desired location, wire <b>684</b>, which has sufficient length to extend out of the patient even when device <b>10</b> is mounted in the intended position on frame <b>600</b>, can be withdrawn by an operator, thereby freeing the expandable member. Upon inputting of gas and/or liquid to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>it unfurls and assumes its expanded configuration. Although devices that are attached by an anchoring frame <b>600</b> typically will not require further anchoring, it is noted that such procedures are not limited to anchoring using only the anchoring frame, as any of the other attachment or anchoring techniques and features may optionally be used in addition to anchoring with an anchoring frame <b>600</b>. In this regard, it is noted that looped tabs <b>682</b> may be used as attachment areas, e.g., through which sutures, staples or tacks, etc. may be driven to further attach device <b>10</b> to the patient. Still further, whether or not used to attach device <b>10</b>, looped tabs also provide convenient and safe areas for manipulation by the use of tools, such as graspers, etc. It is further noted that this type of compaction feature can be provided for devices that are not attached to an anchoring frame <b>600</b>, but are attached by other means described herein, or are attached only by attaching tabs <b>682</b> to tissues within the patient. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0255\" num=\"0254\"> Alternatively, an expandable compaction member <b>686</b> may be provided to surround and compact expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>for delivery thereof as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21C-21D</figref>. For example, expandable compaction member <b>686</b> may be a thermoformed balloon that is formed to roll up when inflated, but can be opened up or spread apart or held open in a relatively flattened out configuration in its non-expanded (deflated) state as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21C</figref>. This open configuration allows a rolled up or otherwise compressed expandable member to be placed on expandable compaction member <b>686</b>. Expandable compaction member <b>686</b> is then inflated/expanded via conduit <b>686</b> <i>i, </i>whereupon it assumes it rolled-up configuration, thereby substantially surrounding the compacted expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>as illustrated in the end view of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21D</figref>. In this configuration, the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and compaction member <b>686</b> are deliverable into the abdominal cavity for location at the intended surgical target site. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0256\" num=\"0255\"> Once in the intended surgical target site, i.e., in the location where it is desired to expand the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>compaction member <b>686</b> may then be deflated and then withdrawn from its encapsulation of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and from the abdominal cavity. Optionally, expandable member may first be attached to a rail or to some other fixation point to prevent it from being withdrawn as compaction member <b>686</b> is withdrawn. After removal of compaction member <b>686</b>, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be expanded in the course of a procedure as described with regard to any of the embodiments described herein or in any of the disclosures for which priority has been relied upon. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0257\" num=\"0256\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref> illustrates another embodiment in which a rigid exoskeleton <b>688</b> is provided to receive expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and maintain it in a compressed or otherwise non-expanded configuration for delivery into the surgical target area. For example, exoskeleton may be in the form of a rigid canister as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref>, that functions similar to a film canister for 35 mm film. That is, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be rolled up or otherwise inserted into canister <b>688</b> to be retained therein in a non-expanded state. Typically, at least an edge of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>will be left slightly protruding from the opening or slot <b>68</b> <b>8</b> <i>s </i>provided in exoskeleton <b>688</b>. In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref>, the edge of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>protruding from opening <b>688</b> <i>s </i>includes tabs <b>682</b>, looped tabs <b>682</b> <i>a </i>or other features for engaging with a rail or other anchored structure in the abdominal cavity <b>682</b>. In the case of looped tabs <b>682</b>, of other feature for engaging a rail or other fixed structure, these features can be looped over or otherwise engage with the fixed structure in the abdominal cavity when the exoskeleton containing the compressed or otherwise non-expanded expandable member is inserted into the surgical target location in the abdominal cavity. Upon fixing the looped tabs <b>682</b> <i>a </i>or other feature to the rail or other fixed structure, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can then be extracted from exoskeleton <b>688</b> by rotating exoskeleton <b>688</b> in a rotational direction opposite to the direction of the arrows shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref>. This causes extraction of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>out of the exoskeleton <b>688</b> as illustrated by the directional arrows shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref>. Rotation can be effected by a rod or wire <b>689</b> that is fixed to a proximal end portion of exoskeleton <b>688</b> and which may be rigid or flexible, but is torsionally rigid in either case. Alternatively, rigid exoskeleton <b>688</b> can be retracted in a linear direction opposite the directional arrows shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21E</figref>. This motion, applied against the force provided by the fixation of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>relative to at least one fixed structure in the abdominal cavity, cause extraction of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>out of rigid exoskeleton <b>688</b> as rigid exoskeleton <b>688</b> moves away from the fixed/anchored portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0258\" num=\"0257\"> If tabs <b>682</b> are provided on the edge of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>one or more of tabs <b>682</b> may be temporarily or permanently anchored to a structure in the abdominal cavity, e.g., by suturing, stapling, tacking and/or adhesives or other alternative fixing members or substances, and then an unrolling motion like that described above can be carried out to extract the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Alternatively, or if no additional features are present on the edge of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>one or more tabs <b>682</b> or the edge of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be grasped, by graspers, or other long slender tool and then exoskeleton <b>688</b> can be rotated as described. In any of the procedures described above, once expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>has been completely extracted from exoskeleton <b>688</b>, exoskeleton <b>688</b> is withdrawn out of the patient to provide working space for continuing procedures to implant device <b>10</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0259\" num=\"0258\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21F</figref> shows still another alternative configuration for placing expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in a compacted or collapsed configuration for delivery into the abdominal cavity to the surgical target area. In this example, expandable member is folded into an accordion-fold configuration so that the expandable member is folded over on itself along folds <b>687</b>, similar to the way that a bicycle tube is packaged for sale. In this folded configuration, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be received in an exoskeleton <b>688</b> such as described above, or can be delivered via a sheath, for example. Additionally or alternatively, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be temporarily retained in the folded configuration by attaching the adjacent pleats or folds together using weak adhesive bonds that are broken when expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is expanded, by the force of the inflation fluid pressure, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0260\" num=\"0259\"> In another embodiment, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>may be compressed in a capsule <b>692</b> that is formed of a water soluble gel or skin <b>692</b> <i>s </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21G</figref>. In this case, the compressed expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is inserted into the abdominal cavity and to the surgical target area location while soluble skin <b>692</b> <i>s </i>maintains expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>compacted. As capsule <b>692</b> enters the aqueous environment of the abdominal cavity, skin <b>692</b> <i>s </i>begins to dissolve. After a predetermined amount of time in the aqueous environment of the abdominal cavity, skin <b>692</b> has dissolved by a sufficient amount such that the input of expansion media into expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>causes expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to expand with sufficient force to rupture capsule <b>692</b> if is has not dissolved to the extent where it has ruptured simply by dissolution. In either case, capsule <b>692</b> can be retracted out of the patient, using graspers, for example, but need not be, as it will completely dissolve with the passage of additional time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0261\" num=\"0260\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21H</figref> illustrates an embodiment having a flexible, expandable exoskeleton <b>694</b>. In this example, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is surrounded by expandable exoskeleton <b>694</b>, which may be a pleated silicone capsule (or balloon), for example, or partially slitted silicone capsule or balloon, or may have either of these structures and be formed from polyurethane or other biocompatible elastomer, for example. Exoskeleton <b>694</b> is formed so that it maintains the compacted configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21H</figref> as long as expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>does not contain an expansion medium or fluid. After placement of the exoskeleton <b>694</b> containing expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>at the desired surgical target site, exoskeleton <b>694</b> is inflated by inputting expansion medium (e.g., gas or liquid) through a lumen in conduit <b>12</b>, and expansion medium is inputted through another lumen in conduit <b>12</b> causing expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Alternatively, expansion medium inputted through conduit <b>12</b> to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can expand both expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and exoskeleton <b>694</b> simultaneously, with the pleats or slits assisting the expansion. Exoskeleton <b>694</b> may be provided with one or more tabs <b>682</b> that can be used to anchor the exoskeleton <b>694</b> in the expanded configuration, and this may also help to maintain expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in the desired expanded volume, as exoskeleton <b>694</b> supports some of the load applied to device <b>10</b> caused by expansion of the device against the structures in the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0262\" num=\"0261\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21I-21J</figref> illustrate an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that is formed in an elongated tube configuration. This tube formation allows expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to be linearly deployed through a small opening in a patient (or alternatively, may be used in an open surgical procedure). Tabs <b>682</b> are provided at spaced locations along the elongated tube, and act as fixation or anchoring points along the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Thus, portions of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be anchored as they are inserted into and arrive at the surgical target area, such as by stapling, suturing, tacking, etc., tabs <b>682</b> to fixed structures within the abdominal cavity. In this way, elongated member can be laid out and fixed at the surgical target array in an almost infinite number of different configurations that are customizable according to the way that the user bends and fixes the portions of the expandable member. In the example shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21J</figref>, expandable member has been fixed in a serpentine configuration, but this embodiment in is in no way limited to this configuration, as a coiled configuration could be provided, or groups or bunches of portions could be configured, or many other customizable configuration can be fixed, including a more or less random distribution of the portions fixed to structures in the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0263\" num=\"0262\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21K</figref> illustrates an alternative to the use of tabs <b>682</b> in the embodiment of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21I-21J</figref>. In this case, a flange <b>682</b>F is provided along one or more continuous lengths of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>up to the full length of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>to increase the flexibility of the choice of fixation points, since stapling, tacking or suturing can be performed anywhere along the one or more flanges <b>682</b>F. It is noted that this alternative feature is not limited to the elongated tubular form of an expandable member, as one or more flanges <b>682</b> may be provided along any of the expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em </i>described herein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0264\" num=\"0263\"> In another embodiment, device <b>10</b> is compacted and maintained in a compact configuration by insertion within a sheath <b>690</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22A</figref>. Sheath <b>690</b> does not completely encircle expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>but includes a slit through which a rail or channel connected to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>and which is to be connected to frame <b>600</b>, is exposed. Device <b>10</b> can be compacted into a compressed form using any of a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to: rolling (like described above, but wherein looped tabs <b>682</b> are not required), accordion folding (like a bicycle inner tube when it is first purchased), tongue rolled (described in further detail below), randomly compressed by drawing and maintaining a vacuum on expandable member(s) <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>or other folding and compressing. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0265\" num=\"0264\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22B</figref> illustrates an expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>of device <b>10</b> being deployed via an introducer <b>696</b> having a splittable introducer housing at a distal end portion thereof. In the example shown, the distal end portion of introducer is split into two portions or jaws <b>696</b>J that are pivotably mounted for rotation with respect to the remainder of the introducer <b>696</b>, for example, via pivot joint <b>696</b>P. However, it is noted that the distal end portion may be splittable into three or more component jaws <b>696</b>P, as this embodiment is not limited to splitting using only two jaws <b>696</b>P. It is further noted that jaws <b>696</b>J do not have to form equal portions of the distal end of introducer <b>696</b> as shown. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22B</figref> shows expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in a substantially flattened, non-expanded configuration, prior to further compacting it by rolling, accordion-folding, or otherwise further compacting the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i>/device <b>10</b> to be received in the splittable jaws <b>696</b>J of introducer <b>696</b>, that form a housing for the compacted expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>for delivery into the abdominal cavity. A structure referred to as a \u201cdoghouse\u201d surrounds the conduit <b>12</b> where it connects to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and may form a socket into which conduit <b>12</b> is received. In any case, the doghouse strengthens the joint between conduit <b>12</b> and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>to minimize risk of failure at the joint. The doghouse may be made from the same material as conduit <b>12</b> and/or expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Conduit <b>12</b> extends trough the tube of the introducer <b>696</b> and out of a proximal end portion thereof when device <b>10</b> is loaded in the introducer <b>696</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0266\" num=\"0265\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22C</figref> illustrates the compacted device <b>10</b> (including expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i>) having been received in the introducer <b>696</b>, with the splittable jaws <b>696</b>J having been closed around the compacted expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to maintain it in a compact configuration as it is delivered through opening <b>223</b> and through an opening formed in the abdominal muscle <b>127</b> for a percutaneous implantation procedure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0267\" num=\"0266\"> Once jaws <b>696</b>J have completely passed through the opening in the abdominal muscle <b>127</b> and have been placed in the abdominal cavity in the vicinity of the desired location for placement of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>jaws <b>696</b>J are opened by manipulation of tethers <b>696</b>T extending through introducer <b>696</b> and out of a proximal end thereof for manipulation by a user. Tethers <b>696</b>T, although provided as a pair of tethers at the proximal end of the introducer <b>696</b> and connected at the distal ends to a rod or roller <b>697</b> around which expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>has been rolled up in this example. Alternatively, tethers <b>696</b>T can be formed as one continuous tether <b>696</b>T having two proximal ends extending out of the proximal end portion of introducer <b>696</b> and around which expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is rolled or folded at a distal end portion thereof. Upon applying tension to tethers <b>696</b>T when the operator/user pulls on the proximal end portions of tethers <b>696</b>T extending proximally from introducer <b>696</b> while maintaining the introducer <b>696</b> in a fixed position relative to the abdominal muscle <b>696</b>, this rotates the compacted expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>(and roller <b>697</b>, when present) as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22D</figref>, thereby also opening jaws <b>696</b>J. Alternatively, jaws <b>696</b>J may operate like laparoscopic graspers to open and close and are therefore opened first before applying tension on tethers <b>696</b>T to extract device <b>10</b> in a manner described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0268\" num=\"0267\"> When device <b>10</b> has been properly oriented with respect to introducer <b>696</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22E</figref>, one or more tabs <b>682</b> may be fixed to a structure in the abdominal cavity, and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can then be extracted from its compact configuration, such as by unrolling (in the embodiment shown) unfolding, or otherwise extracting the expandable member from the compact state it assumed to be received in the introducer <b>696</b>, by withdrawing the introducer <b>696</b> as the distal end of expandable member is retained by the fixation. Alternatively, graspers or other instrument may be used to grasp a distal most tab or a distal portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to hold it relatively motionless as introducer <b>696</b> is retracted and thus drawn away from device <b>10</b>, thereby extracting expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>as the proximal ends of jaws <b>696</b> are retracted back into the opening through the abdominal muscle, this closes the jaws, allowing them to be completely removed from the abdominal cavity, taking tethers <b>696</b>T (and optionally roller <b>697</b>, if present) along with it. It should be noted that although device <b>10</b> is shown positioned substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of introducer <b>696</b> as the desired orientation of the device <b>10</b> for extracting expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>that this embodiment is not limited to this orientation. For example, a rolled up expandable member, as shown, may be oriented at an acute angle (in either direction) to the perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of introducer <b>696</b>, depending upon various factors, such as the available working space, desired final orientation of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>etc. Also, tabs <b>682</b>, flange <b>682</b>F or other attachment features can be anchored to structures within the abdominal cavity in an incremental fashion, as expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be incrementally extracted, a portion at a time, with anchoring being performed between incremental extraction steps. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0269\" num=\"0268\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22F-22H</figref> illustrate operation of another delivery tool for use in delivering and facilitation of anchoring of device <b>10</b> in the abdominal cavity. This tool also advantageously provides the ability to deliver device <b>10</b> by a percutaneous procedure or laparoscopic procedure. Of course, this tool can also be used in open procedures. The tool includes an inner sheath/delivery shaft <b>696</b> <i>i </i>about which expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be rolled. In the example illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22G</figref>, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>has been folded over and then rolled up around the distal end portion of inner sheath/delivery shaft <b>696</b> <i>i. </i>A portion of delivery shaft/inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i </i>proximal of the portion about which expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is rolled, may be formed in a bend <b>696</b> <i>b </i>as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22G</figref>. Inner sheath/delivery shaft <b>696</b> <i>i </i>may be formed to have the bend <b>696</b> <i>b </i>as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22G</figref>, when in an unbiased configuration, but is flexible so that inner sheath/delivery shaft <b>696</b> <i>i </i>can be biased into a substantially straight configuration. Alternatively, bend <b>696</b> <i>b </i>may be formed as a pivoted or hinged joint, which can be operated upon retraction of outer sheath <b>696</b> <i>o </i>therefrom. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0270\" num=\"0269\"> As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22F</figref>, an outer sheath <b>696</b> <i>o </i>is provided that slides freely over inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i. </i>After compacting expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>such as by rolling it around the distal end portion of inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i, </i>the distal end portion of inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i </i>is biased to substantially straighten inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i, </i>and outer sheath <b>696</b> <i>o </i>is slid distally over inner sheath <b>6961</b> to cover the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and maintain it in a compact or compressed configuration as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22F</figref>. The tool and device <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22F</figref> are then ready for use. The distal end containing device <b>10</b>/expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is inserted into the abdominal cavity, such as by delivery though a percutaneous or laparoscopic opening, for example. One in the vicinity of the intended implantation site (surgical target location), outer sheath <b>696</b> <i>o </i>can be retracted relative to inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i. </i>As outer sheath <b>696</b> <i>o </i>is retracted to the extent that bend <b>696</b> <i>b </i>is no longer covered, inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i </i>returns to its unbiased, bent configuration, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22G</figref>. At this time, the distal end portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>and typically at least one attachment tab <b>682</b> (or attachment flange <b>682</b>F, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22G</figref>) are presented and the distal end portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be sutured, stapled, tacked, etc. to an internal structure in the abdominal cavity. By incrementally retracting inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i, </i>incremental portions of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be extracted (e.g., unrolled and/or unfolded) with fixation of these portions being accomplished between the incremental extraction steps. Alternatively, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be nearly fully extracted or fully extracted after just the first fixation of the distal end portion has been accomplished, or even without any anchoring of tabs <b>682</b>/<b>682</b>F if the surgeon desired to just grasp the distal end portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>with graspers or other temporary fixation tool as inner sheath <b>696</b> <i>i </i>is retracted. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22H</figref> illustrates the expandable member when is has been almost completely extracted. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0271\" num=\"0270\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22I-22K</figref> illustrate operation of another delivery tool for use in delivering and facilitation of anchoring of device <b>10</b> in the abdominal cavity. This tool also advantageously provides the ability to deliver device <b>10</b> by a percutaneous procedure or laparoscopic procedure. Of course, this tool can also be used in open procedures. The tool in this embodiment includes an introducer that comprises a rigid, closed-ended (at the proximal end) sheath or tube <b>696</b> that houses the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>during delivery thereof, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22K</figref>. An attachment tab <b>682</b> or other distal portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>may be left extending distally from sheath <b>696</b> after expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is loaded into sheath <b>696</b> for delivery thereof, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22K</figref>. This facilitates grasping of the distal portion and/or anchoring thereof to a structure in the abdominal cavity, as described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0272\" num=\"0271\"> Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>in a non-expanded or deflated state is substantially flattened and then rolled from both side edges (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 221</figref>) toward a central axis, to form what is referred to as a \u201ctongue-roll\u201d configuration, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22J</figref>. By rolling up expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>from both side edges, this avoid twisting of lumen <b>12</b> which is located substantially in alignment with the central axis of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in this case. The tongue-rolled expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is then inserted into the open distal end of introducer <b>696</b> and slid into the sheath <b>696</b> of the introducer until configured as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22K</figref>. In the example shown, lumen <b>12</b> is short and does not extend much (if at all) past the edge of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>In cases where lumen <b>12</b> is longer, lumen <b>12</b> can extend alongside the tongue-rolled expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to extend out of the distal end opening of sheath <b>696</b> and then bend back to run along the length of introducer sheath <b>696</b> so that a proximal end of lumen <b>12</b> extends out of the body with the proximal end of sheath <b>696</b> as expandable member is placed in the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0273\" num=\"0272\"> Since the introducer comprises a rigid sheath <b>696</b>, it can be used to perform blunt dissection while delivering expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to the intended surgical target location in the abdominal cavity. Once the distal end portion of the introducer/sheath <b>696</b> that contains expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>has been located in the vicinity of the surgical target location, the attachment tab <b>682</b> (or flange <b>682</b>F) that extends distally of the distal end of sheath <b>696</b> can be sutured, stapled, tacked, etc. to an internal structure in the abdominal cavity. By incrementally retracting sheath <b>696</b>, incremental portions of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be extracted (e.g., and unrolled) with fixation of these portions being accomplished between the incremental extraction steps. Alternatively, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can be nearly fully extracted or fully extracted after just the first fixation of the distal end portion has been accomplished, or even without any anchoring of tabs <b>682</b>/<b>682</b>F if the surgeon desires to just grasp the distal end portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>with graspers or other temporary fixation tool as sheath <b>696</b> is retracted. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0274\" num=\"0273\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22L-22M</figref> illustrate another variation of an arrangement for compacting device <b>10</b> and maintaining it the compact configuration for delivery into the abdominal cavity. In another embodiment, device <b>10</b> is compacted and maintained in a compact configuration by insertion within a sheath <b>690</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22A</figref>. Sheath <b>690</b> does not completely encircle expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>but includes a slit through which a rail or channel connected to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>and which is to be connected to frame <b>600</b>, is exposed. Device <b>10</b> can be compacted into the compressed configuration by rolling it in flexible sheath <b>690</b>. In this case, sheath <b>690</b> can completely surround device <b>10</b> when the device is to be anchored using tabs <b>150</b>. Once rolled up, such as by tongue-rolling or other rolling technique, the sheath <b>690</b> and device <b>10</b> assembly can be further compacted/compressed by drawing it through a funnel compactor <b>691</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22M</figref>, by pushing and/or pulling assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> to the left in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22M</figref> and/or pushing or pulling compactor funnel <b>691</b> to the right in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22M</figref>. The small opening of the funnel compactor <b>691</b> can be made to have an inside diameter of a maximum, predetermined size acceptable for delivery of the assembly through a small opening and into the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0275\" num=\"0274\"> Further optionally, an additional sheath or inserter <b>696</b> can be mounted over the small end of compactor funnel <b>691</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22N</figref>, so that the further compressed assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> is loaded into this additional sheath or inserter <b>696</b>. The introducer or sheath <b>696</b> can then be inserted through a small opening in the skin of the patient and into the abdominal cavity, where assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> can be extracted according to any of the techniques described above. Further alternatively, sheath <b>696</b> may be open ended at both ends, and a pusher rod can be pushed through the proximal end opening of sheath or introducer <b>696</b> to drive the assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> out of the distal end opening. In any of these arrangements, once the assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> has been extracted, it can be unrolled, and device <b>10</b> can be positioned and anchored according to any of the techniques described herein. Sheath <b>690</b> is removed from the abdominal cavity and from the patient. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0276\" num=\"0275\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22O</figref> shows a further alternative arrangement, in which sheath <b>690</b> and device <b>10</b> after rolling and compressing according to the techniques described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22L-22M</figref>, is back-loaded on a steerable, flexible endoscope <b>356</b>. Alternatively, sheath <b>690</b> and device <b>10</b> can be wrapped and compressed around steerable, flexible endoscope <b>356</b> to backload the assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> thereon, without the use of compactor funnel <b>691</b>. According to either of these techniques, after making a small incision <b>223</b> in the patient, the endoscope <b>356</b> is advanced through the opening and into the abdominal cavity. The endoscope <b>356</b> can be steered during this process to advance the distal tip <b>790</b> thereof to a desired location in the abdominal cavity where it is desired to place device <b>10</b>. Also, full insufflation of the abdominal cavity is not needed in order to deliver device <b>10</b> by this technique. Once the distal tip <b>796</b> of endoscope <b>356</b> has been steered and advanced to a desired location in the abdominal cavity, assembly <b>690</b>,<b>10</b> can then be delivered over the shaft of endoscope <b>356</b> and ejected off of the distal end of endoscope. Device <b>10</b> may be delivered over an anchoring frame <b>600</b> using this technique, and/or ejected into the abdominal cavity for subsequent positioning and anchoring by tabs <b>150</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0277\" num=\"0276\"> Optionally, as the endoscope <b>356</b> assembly is being advanced, impulse puffs of pressurized gas can be intermittently applied through the distal end of endoscope <b>356</b> (or with an additional conduit that delivers these impulses to the location of (or just distal to) the distal end of endoscope <b>356</b> to help open a pathway along which it is desired to steer the endoscope <b>356</b>. Further alternatively, device <b>10</b> can be compacted and back-loaded around endoscope <b>356</b> without sheath <b>690</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0278\" num=\"0277\"> Further alternatively and optionally, endoscope <b>356</b> may be provided with an expandable distal tip/lens <b>790</b> <i>e </i>that is expandable distally away from and around the distal end <b>790</b> of endoscope through which viewing is performed, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22P-22Q</figref>. This expandable tip <b>790</b> can be expanded to displace tissue away from viewing end <b>790</b> to provide a clear view so the that operator can more easily steer the distal end to a desired location. This arrangement does not require the use of \u201cpuffs\u201d or impulses of pressurized insufflation gas, or any insufflation whatsoever. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22Q</figref> illustrates expandable tip/lens as an inflatable balloon which is shown in an inflated/expanded configuration. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22R</figref> shows a variant of the tip/lens <b>790</b> <i>e </i>in an expanded configuration, in which balloon <b>790</b> is further reinforced by deployable wires <b>791</b> that can be extended distally (as shown) and retracted proximally of the distal end <b>790</b> when it is desired to have the tip <b>790</b> in a non-expanded (undeployed) configuration. Wires <b>791</b> can be biased toward the expanded configuration shown, so that they expand the balloon <b>790</b> <i>e </i>without the need to inflation gas or liquid into the balloon <b>790</b> <i>e. </i>Alternatively, balloon <b>70</b> <i>e </i>can be expanded by both gas or liquid (typically liquid) and the mechanical forces applied by expanding wires <b>791</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0279\" num=\"0278\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22S</figref> illustrates an alternative to use of a flexible, steerable endoscope <b>356</b> inserted and used as a guide rail for delivery of device <b>10</b> (as well as, optionally, other devices or instruments) thereover and into the abdominal cavity, as described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 220</figref>. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22S</figref>, a flexible wire <b>502</b> <i>e </i>that is similar in construction to guidewire <b>502</b>, only slightly larger in cross-sectional diameter, includes one or more optical fibers extending the length thereof to facilitate viewing through the distal end portion <b>502</b> <i>de </i>of wire <b>502</b> <i>e. </i>Accordingly, wire <b>502</b> <i>e </i>can be inserted in the same manner as guidewire <b>502</b> and used for the same purposes. However, visualization can be performed as the flexible wire <b>502</b> <i>e </i>is being inserted and advanced, for visual verification that the distal end portion is being delivered to an intended location in the abdominal cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0280\" num=\"0279\"> Optionally, wire <b>502</b> <i>e </i>may include an expandable tip, such as an inflatable balloon, like <b>70</b> <i>e </i>describe above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22Q</figref>. This balloon can be expanded to provided an enlarged visual field. By foregoing the steering mechanism of a steerable endoscope <b>356</b> and guiding the wire <b>502</b> <i>e, </i>assisted by visualization, into the abdominal cavity in a manner as described with regard to insertion of guidewire <b>502</b>, this allows <b>502</b> <i>e </i>to have a significantly smaller cross sectional area than a steerable endoscope <b>356</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0281\" num=\"0280\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates a device deployment tool <b>700</b> that can be used to deploy device <b>10</b> over anchoring frame <b>600</b>. Tool <b>700</b> includes a handle <b>702</b> for manual operation by a user (e.g., surgeon) and an elongated shaft <b>704</b> extending distally therefrom. Shaft <b>704</b> in included a groove or rail that substantially matches a groove or rail of frame <b>600</b> over which device <b>10</b> is to be mounted. Accordingly, device <b>10</b> slides over the groove or rail of tool <b>700</b> and can be delivered over guidewire or rod <b>502</b> into alignment with the groove or rail of frame <b>600</b> where device <b>10</b> can then be pushed off of shaft (rail or groove) <b>704</b> and over the rail or groove of frame <b>600</b> to anchor the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>of the device <b>10</b> to frame <b>600</b>. One or more lumens may be provided through shaft <b>704</b> for delivery of irrigating fluids (or other substances) and for application of suction to the distal end of shaft <b>704</b>, via ports <b>640</b> and <b>642</b>, respectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0282\" num=\"0281\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 24A-24C</figref> illustrate an access member attachment tool <b>730</b> and use of tool <b>730</b> for rapid attachment of access member <b>80</b> to the patient <b>1</b>. Access member attachment tool <b>730</b> includes a handle <b>732</b> for handling and control by a user, and a working end <b>736</b> at a distal end portion thereof. According to this approach, an anvil <b>738</b> is slid over conduit(s) <b>12</b> prior to connecting access member <b>80</b> to the distal end(s) of conduit(s) <b>12</b>. Working end <b>736</b> is configured to received access member <b>80</b> therein, e.g., working end may include a socket shaped and dimensioned to receive access member <b>80</b> therein and to maintain the orientation of access member so as to control it during attachment to the patient. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0283\" num=\"0282\"> Anvil <b>738</b> is first delivered by manipulating (e.g., twisting and pushing) it through opening <b>223</b> and through the opening in the abdominal muscle <b>127</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24B</figref>. Distal end <b>736</b> of tool <b>730</b> may be inserted into the fat layer <b>131</b> either before or after manipulating anvil <b>738</b> into the desired orientation for use. Once anvil has been inserted through the opening in the abdominal muscle and manipulated to orient the anvil surface <b>738</b> <i>s </i>in contact with the abdominal muscle wall <b>127</b>, tool <b>730</b> is used to drive access member <b>80</b> against anvil surface <b>738</b> <i>s </i>as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24C</figref>. An inner shaft of tool <b>730</b> clamps or otherwise engages tubing <b>12</b> and/or anvil <b>738</b> and draws them toward portion <b>736</b> when actuator <b>744</b> is actuated. Access member <b>80</b> includes penetrating members <b>740</b> that extend distally from the contact surface of access member that contacts the abdominal muscle <b>127</b> as access member is driven against anvil <b>738</b>. As access member <b>80</b> is driven against anvil surface <b>738</b> <i>s, </i>penetrating members <b>740</b> are driven against the anvil surface <b>738</b> <i>s </i>and thereby bent over, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24C</figref>, thereby anchoring access member to the abdominal muscle wall. Driving of access member <b>80</b> against anvil <b>738</b> may be performed by simply pushing with handle <b>732</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, and further optionally, actuator <b>744</b> may be operably configured to deploy penetrating members distally from the contact surface of access member <b>80</b> upon actuation of the actuator. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0284\" num=\"0283\"> Alternative mechanisms may be used for attachment of access member <b>80</b> to the patient <b>1</b>. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25A</figref> shows use of hook and loop type fasteners <b>746</b> <i>a, </i> <b>746</b> <i>b </i>or other interlocking mechanism used for a quick connect mechanism to attach access member <b>80</b> to the abdominal muscle <b>127</b> of the patient <b>1</b>. In the example shown, a ring <b>747</b> that contains or is made of one of either hook or loop material (<b>746</b> <i>a </i>or <b>746</b> <i>b, </i>respectively) is stapled or sutured to the abdominal muscle layer <b>127</b> to surround the opening in the abdominal muscle and conduit(s) <b>12</b>. The contact surface of access member is provided with the other of either the hook or loop material, respectively, such that when access member is pushed against ring <b>747</b>, the interlocking mechanism <b>746</b> (in this example, hook and loop materials) interlock, thereby attaching access member <b>80</b> to the patient. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0285\" num=\"0284\"> In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25B</figref>, ring <b>747</b> is provided with one or more magnets <b>748</b> <i>b </i>having polarity on the surface facing access member <b>80</b> that is opposite the polarity of the surfaces of magnets <b>748</b> <i>a </i>facing ring <b>747</b>. Ring <b>747</b> may be provided with anchors <b>749</b> and/or may be sutured, or adhered to abdominal muscle layer <b>127</b>. By pressing access member <b>80</b> against the anchored ring <b>747</b>, connection mechanism <b>748</b> connects access member <b>80</b> to the patient <b>1</b> via the attraction forces of magnets <b>748</b> <i>a, </i> <b>748</b> <i>b. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0286\" num=\"0285\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25C and 25D</figref> illustrate undeployed and deployed configurations, respectively, of an access member having deployable anchors <b>750</b>. Anchors <b>750</b> are extendable, for example, by collapsing external tubing using compression force. By retracting the inner tubing or shaft that is axially positioned inside anchors <b>750</b> with a distal end connected thereto, this drives anchors <b>750</b> into the extended configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25D</figref>. That is, the functionality is like a moly-bolt. Anchors <b>750</b> include arms that are hingedly connected and which bend to expand outwardly, as they are compressed by retracting the internal tube. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0287\" num=\"0286\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25E and 25F</figref> illustrate undeployed and deployed configurations, respectively, of an access member having a spring member <b>752</b> that functions to anchor access member <b>80</b> to the patient <b>1</b>. In the undeployed configuration of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25E</figref>, spring member <b>752</b> is wound to as to assume a relatively small outside diameter.

After inserting access member <b>80</b> into position with respect to the abdominal muscle wall <b>127</b>, so that spring member <b>752</b> passes through the opening in the abdominal muscle and is located inside the abdominal muscle wall <b>127</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25E</figref>, safety lock <b>754</b> is released, so that spring member <b>752</b> unwinds to its deployed configuration, where it has a much larger outside diameter that is too large to pass back through the opening in the abdominal muscle <b>127</b>, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25F</figref>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0288\" num=\"0287\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25G-25H</figref> show an embodiment of access member that is connectable via a snap fit that provides a clamping action between base <b>80</b> <i>b </i>and external portion <b>80</b> <i>e. </i>Base <b>80</b> <i>b </i>is provided with a spacer <b>756</b> having a length about the same as the thickness of the abdominal muscle <b>127</b>. The top portion of tubular spacer is provided with a lip <b>756</b> <i>a </i>that has a outside diameter slightly greater than the inside diameter or the opening <b>758</b> <i>a </i>to socket <b>758</b>. Base <b>80</b> <i>b </i>inserted through the opening in the abdominal muscle and oriented so that contact surface <b>80</b> <i>sb </i>aligns with the inner wall of abdominal muscle <b>127</b> and spacer <b>756</b> extends out through the opening in the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. External portion <b>80</b> <i>e </i>is then pressed against base <b>80</b> <i>b </i>with tubular spacer <b>756</b> aligned with socket <b>758</b>, so that lip <b>756</b> <i>a </i>snaps through opening <b>758</b> <i>a </i>and is retained within socket <b>758</b>, thereby connecting access member <b>80</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0289\" num=\"0288\"> Anchoring frame <b>600</b> may be provided with an interlock <b>760</b> on a proximal end portion thereof, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25I</figref>. In this case, anchoring frame <b>600</b> is provided with sufficient length to extend to the location against the abdominal wall <b>127</b> where it is desired to attach access member <b>80</b>. Interlock <b>760</b> may be provided with resiliently deflectable teeth <b>762</b> that deform as engagement members <b>764</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25J</figref>) located on access member <b>80</b> are inserted therethrough. Engagement members may have threading or be otherwise formed to have alternating large and small diameter portions, so that the large diameter portions deflect teeth <b>762</b>, while the small diameter portions allow teeth <b>762</b> to rebound thereagainst to form a lock relative to the adjacent large diameter portions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0290\" num=\"0289\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25K</figref> shows an embodiment of access member <b>80</b> that is connectable via an automatic engagement mechanism <b>763</b> that functions like a chuck for a pneumatic tool. That is, the base portion that is inserted intra-abdominally includes a socket portion having one or more sets of spring-loaded bearings or detents <b>765</b>, and the external portion includes a tubular shaft to be inserted into the socket portion and which has one or more annular recesses <b>767</b> configured to mate with detents <b>765</b>. Thus, when the tubular shaft of the external portion is inserted into the socket portion, the outer wall of the tubular shaft depresses detents <b>765</b> allowing the tubular shaft to be further inserted. When aligned with annular recesses <b>767</b>, detents resiliently return to their orientations shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25K</figref> and are received in recess(es) <b>767</b>, thereby locking the two components of access member <b>80</b> together on opposite sides of the abdominal muscle <b>127</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0291\" num=\"0290\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25L-25M</figref> show another variation of an air hose type of quick connector. In either this embodiment or the embodiment of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25K</figref>, the male and female connector parts can be reversed relative to the positions shown. In this embodiment, connector <b>769</b> may be provided either as a part of access member <b>80</b>, or simply as a connector for anchoring device <b>10</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> and/or to provide a connection to conduit <b>12</b> that extends externally of the abdominal wall. Balls <b>765</b> and groove <b>767</b> function in the same way as described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25K</figref>. However, in this instance, connector <b>769</b> includes a locking sleeve <b>771</b> that slides over balls <b>765</b> to maintain them in the locked configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25L</figref>). Locking sleeve <b>771</b> is retractable, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25M</figref> to allow balls <b>765</b> to deflect radially outwardly to allow insertion of the male portion of the connector <b>769</b> into the female portion and then slide sleeve <b>771</b> back over balls <b>765</b> to lock them in position in groove <b>767</b>. Sleeve <b>771</b> may be spring biased toward the closed/locked position, wherein it can be manually retracted to the unlocked position. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0292\" num=\"0291\"> As already noted, device <b>10</b> may be implanted by a variety of different methods, including percutaneous methods (examples of which have been described in detail above and which typically do not require pressurized insufflation of the entire abdominal cavity, or generalized anesthesia, and one or more steps may be performed without direct visualization), laparoscopic methods (which typically include pressurized insufflation of the entire abdominal cavity and the patient <b>1</b> under general anesthesia), min-laparoscopic methods and open methods. In addition to anchoring device <b>10</b> via anchoring frame <b>600</b>, or alternative thereto, other anchoring features and/or techniques may be employed. Any of the various features and/or techniques described herein may be used together, or separately, unless it use of one feature or technique would clearly preclude use of another specifically disclosed feature and technique and they would therefore not be useable together. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0293\" num=\"0292\"> One such method of anchoring involves anchoring device <b>10</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> via tubing extending from device <b>10</b> and through the abdominal wall. For example, conduit <b>12</b> may be used to accomplish such anchoring, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26A</figref>. In examples where device <b>10</b> is implanted an expanded in the space along the diaphragm <b>116</b> as described above, it has been experienced, that, once expanded, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>maintains its position quite well in superior-inferior directions with tendency to move being more likely laterally. By anchoring device <b>10</b> <i>e </i>to the abdominal wall using tubing <b>12</b>, this secures expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>from such lateral movements. Because device <b>10</b> is less likely to move superiorly or inferiorly, this type of anchoring may be sufficient in itself for implantation of device <b>10</b>. An advantage of anchoring only by this technique is that no suturing or stapling inside the abdominal cavity is required. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26A</figref>, a lock nut <b>766</b> is threaded over tubing <b>12</b> to secure expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in contact with the inner abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Lock nut <b>766</b> may include a contact surface covered with tissue ingrowth material such as Dacron, polyester, or other porous material designed to encourage tissue ingrowth or may be formed entirely of a tissue ingrowth material. Further optionally, access member <b>80</b> may be configured to function as an anchor to replace the lock nut, wherein access member <b>80</b> can be fixed by any of the features described herein. This method of anchoring assists in positioning device <b>10</b> and stabilizing it in its intended position. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0294\" num=\"0293\"> In addition or alternative to providing tissue ingrowth enhancing material on the external side of the abdominal muscle wall <b>127</b>, tissue ingrowth enhancing material <b>768</b> may be provided at the interface between expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and the inner wall of the abdominal muscle <b>127</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26B</figref>. For example, a disk of tissue ingrowth enhancing material <b>768</b> may be slid over conduit <b>12</b>. Alternatively, one or more attachment tabs including tissue ingrowth enhancing material <b>768</b> may be fixed to device <b>10</b>, such as expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>as described in more detail below. Examples of tissue ingrowth-enhancing materials include, but are not limited to, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (having an internodal distance typical of those materials used for vascular grafts); mesh materials made of polyester, polypropylene, or the like, typically with pores in the range of about 0.7 mm to about 1.5 mm or about 0.5 mm to about 1.2 mm; polyester having a maximum water permeability of about 1800 to about 4000 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>/min; or felts made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester having a maximum water permeability in the range of about 550 to about 3050 ml/cm<sup>2</sup>/min. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0295\" num=\"0294\"> In addition or alternative to anchoring device <b>10</b> against an intra-abdominal structure (e.g., abdominal muscle wall or other structure) using conduit <b>12</b>, device <b>10</b> may be provided with a positioning member <b>770</b> that can be used to further position or relocate device <b>10</b> and assist in anchoring device <b>10</b> in such position or location. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26C</figref> illustrates an example of a device <b>10</b> including a loop (similar to a belt loop, and which may be made of Dacron-reinforced tubing, for example) shaped positioning member <b>270</b>. When used in a laparoscopic procedure or other procedure using multiple ports through the patient&#39;s skin and into the abdominal cavity, device <b>10</b> can be inserted through a first port. A suture or tether <b>59</b> can be looped through positioning member <b>770</b> and tied off to form a looped suture or tether <b>59</b>. Then a surgeon or assistant can access the suture or tether <b>59</b> via an incision adjacent the port through which the device <b>10</b> was inserted, to hook, grasp or otherwise capture suture or tether <b>59</b> and pull it out through the incision where access was made (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26D</figref>). For example, graspers, an elongated instrument having a hook at a distal end thereof, or other endoscopic instrument may be used to capture suture or tether <b>59</b> and pull it out of the opening though the patient&#39;s skin. This tension exerted on suture or tether <b>59</b> and pulling of the suture or tether <b>59</b> out of the patient draws device <b>10</b> toward the opening through which suture or tether is drawn, thereby drawing an inferior surface of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <b>1</b> up against the abdominal wall <b>127</b> in this example. Alternatively, tension may be applied to the suture or tether <b>59</b> as it extends from the opening through which the device <b>10</b> was inserted, to draw attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> up against the abdominal wall for attaching tab(s) <b>150</b> thereto. For a percutaneous procedure where only a single port is provided for delivery and implantation of device <b>10</b> an additional puncture can be performed through the patient&#39;s skin and into the abdominal cavity, at a location where it is desired to draw suture or tether <b>59</b> through and to draw device <b>10</b> against an intra-abdominal structure. For example, an elongated needle <b>772</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26E</figref>) having a hooked slot <b>774</b> may be used to pierce the patient&#39;s skin, access the abdominal cavity, and capture suture or tether <b>59</b> in hooked slot <b>774</b>. Needle <b>772</b> can then be retracted out of the patient <b>1</b> to draw suture or tether <b>59</b> out of the patient to draw device <b>10</b> against a structure in the abdominal cavity to anchor it there. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0296\" num=\"0295\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26F</figref> illustrates a step of attaching attachment tab <b>150</b> to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, according to one embodiment using a laparoscopic procedure. In this case, tension is applied to tether/suture <b>59</b> as it extends through the opening <b>223</b>/port <b>390</b> <i>a </i>that was used to insert device <b>10</b> into the abdominal cavity. As tension is applied graspers <b>784</b> having been inserted through port <b>390</b> <i>d</i>are used to manipulate attachment tab <b>150</b> to approximate it to the abdominal wall <b>150</b> for attachment thereto. Thus, tension may also be applied via the graspers <b>784</b>. A laparoscopic stapler <b>786</b>, inserted through port <b>390</b> <i>b </i>is used to staple attachment tab(s) to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Visualization of all operations can be provided via endoscope <b>356</b> inserted through port <b>390</b> <i>c. </i>It is noted that invention is not limited to the locations and number of ports shown, as the locations and numbers may vary. For example, an additional opening may be provided to insert a liver retractor for retraction of the liver during the procedure, such as was described in application Ser. No. 11/407,701 with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 67</figref>. Also, the arrangement of the instruments shown may vary depending on need for the steps being performed. As one non-limiting example, stapler <b>786</b> may be inserted through port <b>390</b> <i>c </i>while endoscope <b>356</b> is inserted through port <b>390</b> <i>b. </i>Further alternatively, suture/tether may be drawn through another port, as already noted above. This attachment process can be carried out in addition to fixing device <b>10</b> to an anchoring frame <b>600</b> according to any of the techniques described above, or alternative to it, where a frame <b>600</b> is not used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0297\" num=\"0296\"> Further optionally, device <b>10</b> may be provided with a plurality of positioning members <b>770</b> such as positioning loops, for example, spaced longitudinally along device <b>10</b>. Two, three, four or more such members <b>770</b> may be provided along expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>for example. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26G</figref> shows an example of device <b>10</b> having three positioning loops <b>770</b> longitudinally spaced along expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>. By providing multiple positioning members <b>770</b> that are longitudinally spaced, the same device can be used for patients having different anatomies that may have different positioning requirements for the expanded device <b>10</b> and or may have different volume requirements of a spaced to be filled by device <b>10</b>. Depending upon the loop <b>770</b> selected by the surgeon to be used to position and anchor device <b>10</b>, device <b>10</b> can be anchored, for example to the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, with more or less of the surface of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>drawn up against the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. This in turn varies the angulation and positioning of device <b>10</b> in the abdominal cavity. Typically, the surgeon will have an idea of which positioning member <b>770</b> is to be used for the particular patient that device <b>10</b> is being implanted in, for example, after studying the anatomy of the patient&#39;s abdominal cavity and structures therein, as provided by prior MRI or CT scanning for example. In such case, only one positioning member <b>770</b> will have a suture or tether <b>59</b> looped there around to be used as described above. Alternatively, more than one, up to all of the positioning members <b>770</b> may have a suture or tether <b>59</b> looped there around so that the surgeon can try alternative positioning with more that one positioning member, using one at a time successively and observing (such as by fluoroscopy, for example) the relative positions of device <b>10</b> resulting from each use of a different positing member <b>770</b>. The \u201cbest fit\u201d can then be selected and used to complete the anchoring of the device. Prior to that however, the tethers or sutures <b>59</b> that are not chosen for final use in positioning are cut and removed through the opening that will be used to draw the selected tether or suture therethrough for positioning. Thus, these cut, non-selected tethers or sutures <b>59</b> are removed from the surgical site prior to use of the selected suture or tether <b>59</b> to perform attachment/anchoring of device <b>10</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0298\" num=\"0297\"> Still further, positioning members <b>770</b> may be segmented <b>777</b> to provide multiple positioning features or channels <b>778</b> within a loop <b>770</b> (as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26H</figref>) or multiple positioning members <b>770</b> may be spaced in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal spacing (as indicated in phantom lines in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26G</figref>) to provide further positioning control choices for orienting device <b>10</b> angularly about a longitudinal axis, as indicated by the direction of orientation adjustment <b>776</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26G</figref>. The choice of positioning member <b>770</b> among the longitudinally spaced members <b>770</b> varies the positioning about a transverse axis of device <b>10</b> (i.e., axis passing into the page and through the middle of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0299\" num=\"0298\"> To facilitate anchoring of device <b>10</b> after positioning by positioning members, device <b>10</b> may be provided with one or more attachment tabs <b>150</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26F</figref> illustrates a single continuous attachment tab <b>150</b> that extends from expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>about a circumferentially extending portion of the surface of the inferior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>. Attachment tab <b>150</b> may be bonded to the surface of expandable <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, such as with silicone dip layer, for example, or using room temperature vulcanizing silicone adhesive. Alternatively, unvulcanized silicone sheeting can be placed between tab <b>150</b> and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and these layers can be vulcanized together using a heated press. Further alternatively, if the materials are made of polyurethane, a solvent bond can be made using a slurry mixture of polyurethane to bond a polyurethane tab <b>150</b> to a polyurethane expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0300\" num=\"0299\"> Alternatively, multiple attachment tabs <b>150</b> can be placed at locations around expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to extend from and substantially cover areas covered by a larger single attachment tab <b>150</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27A</figref> illustrates one such example of a device <b>10</b> with multiple attachment tabs <b>150</b>, in this case, having three attachment tabs <b>150</b>. By providing multiple attachment tabs, the tabs are more easily able to conform to the structure that they are being attached to, particularly if there is some curvature or other surface shape other than planar in the structure. That is, tabs <b>150</b> can be overlapped to reduce the overall coverage of the structure to be attached to and this increases the convexity of the attachment surfaces formed by tabs <b>150</b> to better conform to a concave shape of an internal surface of the structure to be attached to (e.g., abdominal wall), or otherwise change to a surface shape to be conformed to, or spread apart to increase the convexity of the attachment surfaces formed by tabs <b>150</b>, or otherwise change to a surface shape to be conformed to. The overlapping prevents folds or wrinkles that would otherwise occur with a single tab <b>150</b> such as like that in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26F</figref>, and the spreading would just not be possible with a single tab like that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26F</figref>. The use of attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> also gives the surgeon the option to not use access member <b>80</b> and/or conduit <b>12</b> to perform an anchoring function. This allows access member <b>80</b> to be placed further away from the ribs, potentially offering the patient less discomfort, and also allows conduit <b>12</b> to be placed so that it is not under tension to perform an anchoring function, thereby lessening the mechanical requirements for conduit <b>12</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0301\" num=\"0300\"> Attachment tabs <b>150</b>, although typically located to extend from the inferior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>need not be so located, but can be placed to extend from any locations on device <b>10</b> or expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>As one example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 261</figref> shows a device <b>10</b> having an attachment tab <b>150</b> extending from a superior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and another attachment tab <b>150</b> extending from an inferior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Tab <b>150</b> will typically be provided with a tissue ingrowth material, such as any of the examples described above. In at least one embodiment, polyester-reinforced silicone sheeting forms the base structure of tab <b>150</b> and this is the material that is bonded onto a silicone expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>The tissue ingrowth-enhancing members or patches <b>152</b> are then separately bonded onto the base structure. In at least one alternative embodiment, the base structure is made of polyester-reinforced polyurethane sheet, while the tissue ingrowth-enhancing member s or patches <b>152</b> can be made of any of the same materials already described above. Tabs <b>150</b> can withstand a tensile force of at least about three to five pounds, on a suture looped therethrough, without tearing of the base structure or the suture ripping out of the base structure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0302\" num=\"0301\"> Tabs can be attached to an intra-abdominal structure by stapling, tacking, suturing or the like. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates one configuration of attachment tab <b>150</b>, wherein the main body portion <b>150</b> <i>a </i>includes a tissue ingrowth-enhancing material. However, a margin portion <b>150</b> <i>b </i>is provided that connects to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that is not tissue ingrowth promoting. Accordingly, after anchoring device <b>10</b> via attachment tab <b>150</b> to a tissue structure within the abdominal cavity, the anchoring may be further fortified after a healing period by the ingrowth of tissue into main body <b>150</b> <i>a. </i>However, since no tissue ingrowth occurs at margin <b>150</b> <i>b, </i>device <b>10</b> can be more easily removed, if necessary, by cutting through the margin material <b>150</b> <i>b, </i>thereby releasing device <b>10</b> from the anchored main body portion <b>150</b> <i>a. </i>Further advantageously, margin portion <b>150</b> <i>b </i>can be made of clear material so as to also function as a \u201cwindow\u201d so that the surgeon can view through it while performing the attachment of main body <b>150</b> <i>a </i>to ensure that no bowel or other tissue not meant to be anchored to, exists between attachment tab <b>150</b> and the tissue intended to be anchored to, at the time of anchoring. For example, margin portion <b>150</b> <i>b </i>may be made of silicone or other transparent material that is biocompatible and has sufficient mechanical strength to maintain the attachment/anchoring function. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0303\" num=\"0302\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27B</figref> illustrates an example of a device having three attachment tabs <b>150</b> extending from the inferior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>but where the tabs <b>150</b> are interjoined by margin portions at the side of the main bodies <b>150</b>. The margin portions are separate to allow tabs <b>150</b> to be overlapped. Additionally, margins <b>150</b> <i>b </i>completely surround the main body portions <b>150</b> <i>a </i>in this embodiment. Potential suturing (or stapling, tacking, or the like) locations are indicated by the circles <b>150</b> <i>s </i>shown on each of the main body portions <b>150</b> <i>a. </i>The circular structure shown centrally located between the tabs <b>150</b> is another tab that may include tissue ingrowth enhancing material and/or the base structure material of tabs <b>150</b>. A positioning loop may be attached to the center of the circle or pass therethrough and be bonded beneath the circle, and used in a manner as described in Application Serial No. (Application Serial No. not yet assigned, Attorney&#39;s Docket No. EXPL-001CIP3, e.g., see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> and descriptions thereof). Alternatively or additionally, this circular structure may be a grasping feature for the surgeon to manipulate the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>during the implantation process. In this case, the circular patch is bonded to the expandable member only over a central portion thereof, with a free edge or border that is not bonded, so that it can be grasped by graspers or other instrumentation. Backing structure <b>10</b> <i>ds </i>may be made, for example, of a reinforced silicone sheet to help distribute the forces generated on attachment tabs anchored to the intra-abdominal structure, over a large area of the expandable member <b>10</b>em. The backing structure <b>10</b> <i>ds </i>may be made of multiple layers of reinforced silicone with non-reinforced silicone sheeting at the margins to provide an interface with expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that substantially avoids generation of stress concentrations. The backing structure <b>10</b> <i>ds </i>also provides structural support to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>(e.g., to help prevent kinking) and helps define and maintain the expanded shape of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in the expanded configuration. The substantially oval-shaped patch above the circular one is also a grasping feature. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0304\" num=\"0303\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27C</figref> schematically illustrates various features that may be provided for attachment of device <b>10</b> within the abdominal cavity, any of which may be used individually, or in any combination with any of the other features disclosed. Any individual use or combination of these features may also be used in addition to anchoring with anchoring frame <b>600</b>. \u201cActive attachment\u201d features or methods includes those that involve mechanical or chemical attachment of a portion of the device to the patient, including, but not limited to, sutures, tacks, staples, adhesives, etc. \u201cPassive attachment\u201d features or method refer to configuring a surface to enhance tissue ingrowth therein or to encourage encapsulation, for example. Thus, all or a portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>(and/or other component of device <b>10</b>) may be provided with a roughened or \u201cbumpy\u201d surface <b>788</b>, as such surfaces have been shown to encourage encapsulation of an implant. Also, porous surfaces <b>782</b> may be provided on any portion of device <b>10</b> that is desired to be anchored, to encourage tissue ingrowth. Thus, for example, attachment tab <b>150</b> can be used solely as a passive attachment feature when it is not actively stapled, tacked or sutured to the abdominal wall, but is merely placed in apposition thereto, and includes a porous portion <b>782</b> that allows tissue to grow into it. Alternatively, attachment tab could be completely nonporous, such as made of silicone, and attached only actively, such as by stapling. Further alternatively, attachment tab <b>150</b> may function for both active and passive attachment when it is stapled, tacked, sutured or adhered to an intra-abdominal structure and also includes a porous portion that encourages tissue ingrowth. Further, any of the other components may include a tissue ingrowth surface on a part or all of such component to provide passive attachment. For passive attachment, a period of about three to about six weeks is generally sufficient to anchor a tissue ingrowth surface of the type described herein, with ingrown tissue. In one experiment a one square inch surface of such material, after three weeks implanted in a dog was found to hold eight pounds of force. The omentum may also be actively attached to device <b>10</b> as serve as a buffer between device <b>10</b> and other organs in the abdomen to reduce irritation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0305\" num=\"0304\"> Optionally, in order to assist the surgeon in properly orienting attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> for attachment to the intended intra-abdominal structure, attachment tab(s) may be provided with one or more structural members <b>152</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29A</figref>) that are deformable, so that attachment tabs <b>150</b> can be compacted to a compact configuration for delivery of device percutaneously or laparoscopically, but which resiliently return to their non-compacted shapes when a compacting force is no longer applied to attachment tabs <b>150</b>. For example, structural member <b>152</b> may be a rib or sheet of shape memory material, such as nickel-titanium alloy or shape memory plastic, or may be made of spring steel (e.g., stainless steel). Alternatively, attachment tabs <b>150</b> may be inflatable, so that they can be expanded to a preshaped and predetermined orientation to facilitate the surgeon&#39;s placement of the attachment tabs against the tissue to be anchored to, and anchoring the tabs <b>150</b> to the tissue. Inflatable tabs <b>150</b> can have attachment features such as flanges at the borders thereof that are not inflatable so that sutures, staples, tacks, etc, can be passed therethrough to anchor the tabs <b>150</b> without deflating them. These inflatable tabs <b>150</b> may also include tissue ingrowth enhancing materials on portions thereof to encourage long term, permanent attachment of the tabs when tissue grows into this material. If multiple attachment tabs <b>150</b> are provided, as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29B</figref>, a single conduit <b>153</b> may be provided to inflate/expand the attachment tabs <b>150</b>, or multiple conduits may be provided. For example, a conduit <b>153</b> may be provided for the inferiorly located tabs <b>150</b>, another conduit may feed the intermediately located tabs <b>153</b> and a third conduit may connect to the superiorly placed tab <b>150</b>. Further alternatively, each attachment tab <b>150</b> may be provided with a dedicated conduit <b>153</b> in fluid communication therewith. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0306\" num=\"0305\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 29C-29E</figref> illustrate another variation of a self-expanding attachment tab <b>150</b>. In this case, structural member <b>152</b> is a self-expanding wire frame configured to conform the attachment tab(s) to the intra-abdominal structure that attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> is/are intended to be anchored to. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29C</figref> illustrates attachment tab <b>150</b> in the self-expanded configuration, wherein wire-frame <b>152</b> is biased toward this configuration. Wire frame <b>152</b> may be made of spring steel (e.g., stainless steel), nickel-titanium alloy, or shape-memory polymer, for example. The self-expanding wire frame <b>152</b> may be sandwiched between layers of, or embedded in the material of the attachment tab(s), for example Dacron-reinforced silicone. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0307\" num=\"0306\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29D</figref> illustrates attachment tab <b>150</b> in a compressed configuration in preparation for loading into a sheath and/or insertion of device through a small opening in the patient <b>1</b>. Wire frame <b>152</b> collapses into the shape shown under compressive forces applied radially inwardly on tab <b>150</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29E</figref> illustrates device <b>10</b> having been inserted into the abdominal cavity, whereupon attachment tab <b>150</b> expands via the self expansion of wire frame <b>152</b> thereby orienting attachment tab <b>150</b> in approximation with the abdominal wall <b>127</b> and to conform to the curvature thereof for attachment thereto. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is illustrated in an expanded configuration. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0308\" num=\"0307\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 29F-29G</figref> show another example of device <b>10</b> provided with a self expanding attachment tab <b>150</b>. In this case, self-expanding member <b>152</b> includes bands of resilient, self-expanding material such as any of those discussed above with regard to wire frame <b>152</b>. Self-expanding member may be sandwiched, or embedded in tab <b>150</b> in a manner as also described previously. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29F</figref> shows tab <b>150</b> fully expanded and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>also in an expanded configuration. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31 G</figref> illustrates expandable member in a contracted or deflated configuration. Self expanding member <b>152</b> in this embodiment is compressed by folding over the bands of the member toward expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>as shown. Conduit <b>12</b> (not shown) may pass through a central opening <b>152</b>o of self expanding member <b>152</b> and tab <b>150</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0309\" num=\"0308\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 29H-29I</figref> illustrate another example of device <b>10</b> provided with a self expanding attachment tab <b>150</b>. In this case, self-expanding member <b>152</b> includes folded bands or bows of resilient, self-expanding material, such as any of the previously mentioned materials. Bows are biased toward the folded-over configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29H</figref>, where they provide an enlarged radius that prevents tab <b>150</b> from passing back through the opening through which device was delivered into the patient and expand attachment tab <b>150</b> to conform to the abdominal wall <b>127</b> for attachment thereto. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29I</figref> shows expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in a compressed configuration and self-expanding member also in a compressed configuration, in preparation for delivery of device <b>10</b> through a small opening in a patient and into the abdominal cavity. In this embodiment, self expanding member <b>152</b> is compressed by applying tension to the proximal end thereof while holding the distal end relatively motionless, whereby it is pulled in the proximal direction to lengthen the self-expanding member, while straightening the bows and thus greatly reducing the radius of self expanding member <b>152</b>/attachment tab <b>150</b>. Self-expanding member may be sandwiched, or embedded in tab <b>150</b> in a manner as also described previously. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0310\" num=\"0309\"> Further alternatively, the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 29H-29I</figref> may be made from straight bands of spring steel or other material described previously and thus be biased toward the smaller radius, collapsed configuration illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 291</figref>. In this case, the proximal and distal end rings of structural member <b>152</b> are provided with mating interlocking connectors <b>152</b>L<b>1</b> and <b>152</b>L<b>2</b>, respectively. Thus, after insertion of device <b>10</b> in the collapsed configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 291</figref>, the proximal end connector <b>152</b>L<b>1</b> is pushed toward the distal end connector <b>152</b>L<b>2</b> while applying a pulling or tension force to the distal end connector <b>152</b>L<b>2</b> (for example, by applying tension to conduit <b>12</b>). When connectors <b>152</b>L<b>1</b>, <b>152</b>L<b>2</b> meet, they interlock, thereby maintaining structural member in the expanded configuration shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29H</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29J</figref> illustrates one example of connectors <b>152</b>L<b>1</b>, <b>152</b>L<b>2</b>, whereby one of the connectors includes resiliently deformable tangs, which are received and locked in the other of the connectors upon joining. Connectors <b>152</b>L<b>1</b>, <b>152</b>L<b>2</b> are not limited to the type shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 29J</figref>, but could be alternative types of mechanical connectors, such as arrangements designed to produce a snap fit, as would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0311\" num=\"0310\"> A portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>may be customized to provide a surface shape that is tailored to better conform to an intra-abdominal structure to be anchored to. For example, for attachment to the inner surface of the anterior abdominal muscle wall <b>127</b>, the portion <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>of the expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>that contacts the abdominal wall <b>127</b> is provided to have a more flattened surface shape, relative to the contour of the remainder of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 30A</figref> illustrates the orientation of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>of device <b>10</b> when implanted in a patient according to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein the hatched portion <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>indicates the portion that contacts the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is placed anteriorly of the stomach and is oriented from an inferior and anterior portion against the anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b> towards the spine in a posterior direction, and towards the head in the superior direction. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 30B</figref> illustrates the more flattened surface conformation of portion <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>relative to the curvature of the remainder of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i>Locations of optional attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> are indicated in phantom lines. Portion <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>is provided with a matching contour to the contour of the abdominal wall <b>127</b> in the location where it contacts the abdominal wall <b>127</b>. This matching contour not only facilitates attachment of attachment tab(s) <b>150</b>, but also facilitates proper orientation of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>even when attachment tab(s) are not used to anchor at this location. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0312\" num=\"0311\"> Alternatively, the portion <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>that provides the surface for conforming to the abdominal structure to be anchored to (e.g., abdominal wall) may be provided on an inflatable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>that is expandable independently of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>(or <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1 </sub>or <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>) as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 31A-31D</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31A</figref> shows inflatable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>in an expanded (inflated) configuration while expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is in a non-expanded or compressed configuration. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31B</figref> shows inflatable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>in an expanded (inflated) configuration and expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>in an expanded configuration. Separate access members <b>80</b> may be provided for inputting compressed liquid through conduits <b>12</b> and <b>123</b> to expandable members <b>10</b>em and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3</sub>, respectively, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31A</figref>. Alternatively, conduits <b>12</b> and <b>123</b> may both be connected to a multi-channel access member <b>80</b>. With both expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>deflated, the members can be substantially flattened as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31C</figref>. Expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em </i>and <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>can then be tightly rolled about the longitudinal axis of device <b>10</b>, in the direction of the arrow shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31C</figref> or direction opposite thereto, to form a compact, rolled device ready for delivery into a patient, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31D</figref>. Device <b>10</b> can be inserted in the arrangement shown, or, optionally, may be encased in a sheath (not shown) for delivery thereof. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0313\" num=\"0312\"> After insertion of device <b>10</b> though an opening in the patient and into the abdominal cavity, expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>3 </sub>can be expanded as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 31A</figref> (either before or after securement of the one or more access members <b>80</b> to the patient) whereupon surface <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>closely approximates the inner anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b>. Surface <b>10</b> <i>ema </i>can then be attached to the abdominal wall by suturing, stapling, tacking, etc. one or more attachment tabs <b>150</b> to the abdominal wall. Expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>can next be expanded to fill the space for restricting expansion of the stomach (and optionally, compressing the stomach), or the patient <b>1</b> can be closed up and allowed a healing period prior to returning for expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0314\" num=\"0313\"> To assist in orienting attachment tab(s) and device <b>10</b> into an intended location and orientation to be implanted in, conduit <b>12</b> may be integrated with, or attached to attachment tab <b>150</b> to extend radially outward along the attachment tab. Since conduit <b>12</b> extends out of the body even after device <b>10</b> has been inserted into the abdominal cavity, manipulation and positioning of attachment tab <b>150</b> can be performed by pulling and/or pushing on conduit <b>12</b> from a location outside the body. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32A</figref> shows an example of a device <b>10</b> having two expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, wherein a conduit <b>12</b> (<b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>or <b>12</b> <sub>2</sub>, <b>12</b> <sub>2 </sub>in the example shown) for one of the expandable members <b>10</b>em<sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, respectively) extends proximally from expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2</sub>, such as through an opening in attachment tab <b>150</b>, and a conduit fluidly connected to the other of the expandable members <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>1</sub>, <b>10</b> <i>em</i> <sub>2 </sub>extends radially outward from the expandable member that it connects with, along attachment tab <b>150</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0315\" num=\"0314\"> Conduit <b>12</b> may be sandwiched between layers of attachment member <b>150</b> or may be fixed to the surface of attachment member <b>150</b> for example, by overlaying banding strips <b>780</b> and adhering the ends of the banding strips on opposite sides of conduit <b>12</b> to attachment tab <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32B</figref>. For example, banding strips <b>780</b> may be made of silicone or reinforced silicone (e.g., Dacron reinforced silicone) and may be adhered to attachment tab <b>150</b> using RTV (room temperature vulcanizing) silicone adhesive. As an alternative to the use of banding strips <b>780</b>, a banding sleeve <b>782</b> may be provided that extends over a majority of the length of the radius (or distance from where attachment tab connects to expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to the free edge perimeter) of attachment tab <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32C</figref>. Banding sleeve <b>782</b> may be made of any of the same materials as banding strips <b>780</b> and may be adhered in the same way. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0316\" num=\"0315\"> In use, device <b>10</b> may be inserted through a small percutaneous opening <b>223</b>, as described above, or through a port in a laparoscopic procedure, with both conduits <b>121</b>, <b>122</b> extending out of the insertion opening. In the case of a laparoscopic procedure, a tool, such as a grasper or other tool designed for laparoscopic use can be inserted through a second opening or port <b>390</b> to capture one of the conduits (e.g., conduit <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32D</figref>) and draw it out of the second opening <b>390</b>. Conduits <b>122</b> and <b>12</b>, can then be manipulated to move and position attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> into a desired location against the anterior abdominal wall <b>127</b>. In the case of a percutaneous procedure, a small puncture can be made at <b>390</b>, using a tool <b>772</b> such as described with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26E</figref>, for example, or other tool or combination of tool configured to perform a puncture and to capture a conduit <b>12</b>, and the conduit can then be capture and withdrawn through the opening <b>390</b>. Laparoscopic ports <b>390</b> may have a diameter of about ten to about twelve millimeters, up to about eighteen millimeters and as small as about five millimeters, although the typical size is about eight to twelve millimeters. Percutaneous opening <b>223</b> may be formed by an incision less than about seven cm, typically less than about five cm. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0317\" num=\"0316\"> Alternatively, conduits <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b> <sub>2 </sub>may pass through separate attachment tabs <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 34E</figref>. By providing separate or segmented attachment features <b>150</b>, this allows more flexibility in placement of the attachment tabs <b>150</b> as to anchoring location, and also may help in conforming to the tissues to be anchored to, but still provides the control of positioning and orientation of the inferior portion of device <b>10</b> and attachment tab <b>150</b> that was described with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32D</figref> above. Attachment tabs <b>150</b> may be separate, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32E</figref>, or this flexibility may also be provided by a segmented attachment tab <b>150</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32F</figref>, where <b>12</b> <sub>2o </sub>shows an opening through which conduit <b>122</b> passes and <b>12</b> <sub>1o </sub>shows a tunnel or lumen through which conduit <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>passes. If the outermost layer of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is made of silicone, RTV silicone adhesive can be used to adhere attachment tab(s) <b>150</b> to the expandable member. One or more of the attachment tabs <b>150</b> may extend along expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>or may join with backing support <b>10</b> <i>ds </i>to provide a larger surface area for force distribution. These extensions and/or backing support <b>10</b> <i>ds </i>may optionally also be provided with one or more patches of tissue ingrowth-enhancing material. Further, the a portion or all of a side of expandable member, such as the anterior facing surface, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27B</figref> may be coated with a layer or otherwise structurally reinforced so as not to expand, or at least not expand as much as the remainder of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>to prevent or at least reduce expansion of expandable member in the anterior direction, and thereby reduce any visible bulging on the external abdomen of the patient (i.e., skin appearance/shape outside the abdominal cavity), while expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>is allowed to preferentially expand posteriorly and medially to effect filling of the space intended to be filled. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0318\" num=\"0317\"> In an alternative attachment procedure, tube <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b> <sub>2 </sub>can be routed through different openings in a patient, similar to any of the ways described above with regard to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32D</figref>. However, in this alternative approach, attachment tabs <b>150</b> are not attached (at least not stapled, tacked or sutured to the abdominal wall, but they may be maintained to encourage tissue ingrowth, or a more conforming tissue ingrowth layer can be provided over an inferior portion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>or neither) to the abdominal wall. Rather, tubes <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b> <sub>2 </sub>are used to position and orient device <b>10</b> as desired and device <b>10</b> is anchored via tube <b>12</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>12</b> <sub>2</sub>, using nuts, sutures, access members, or any of the other features/techniques described previously. Thus, no suturing or stapling to the abdominal wall (at least to the abdominal wall inside the abdominal cavity) is required. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0319\" num=\"0318\"> In any of the procedures described herein, it may be advantageous to orient the patient on his back, with the table angled from about fifteen to about forty-five degrees, typically about thirty degrees, to elevate the head of the patient <b>1</b>. This causes the organs in the abdominal cavity to shift in and inferior direction thereby providing more space in the superior portion of the abdominal cavity and adjacent the diaphragm <b>116</b> to facilitate the insertion procedures. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0320\" num=\"0319\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates a distal end portion of a flexible, endoscope <b>356</b> that may be used in a mini-laparoscopic or laparoscopic procedure to assist visualization of the placement of device <b>10</b> during an implantation procedure. Endoscope <b>356</b> may be used with our without additional fluoroscopic visualization. For example, in an office setting, use of endoscope <b>356</b> without any fluoroscopic visualization may be sufficient for a minimally invasive procedure such as described herein. Endoscope <b>356</b> includes an atraumatic lens <b>790</b> at a distal end portion thereof, with a camera or other visualization means <b>792</b> (e.g., optical fibers extending up to the lens <b>790</b> or a CCD camera placed just proximally of lens <b>790</b>) to provide an image that is delivered to the proximal end of endoscope <b>356</b> outside of the body of the patient. The shaft <b>794</b> of endoscope <b>356</b> is flexible, may be constructed according to existing flexible catheter technology and typically has an outside diameter of five mm or less, preferably about four mm or less, more preferably about three mm or less. The diameter of endoscope shaft <b>794</b>/lens <b>790</b> is in the range of about two to about ten mm, typically about five mm. The distal end portion of endoscope <b>356</b> is steerable, as illustrated by the phantom lines in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 33</figref>, and endoscope <b>356</b> may be maneuvered or steered into a surgical site to provide a desired view, as well as steered, once in a desired site, to provide panning of a location in the abdomen. Steering may be controlled by wires that run along the length of viewing fibers within shaft <b>794</b> up to the tip <b>790</b>. The wires that the proximal end portion are connected to a steering mechanism that tensions the wires and causes deflections at the tip of the scope <b>356</b>. For a more detailed description, see Breedveld et al., \u201cA New, Easily Miniaturized Steerable Endoscope\u201d, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, November/December 2005, pp. 40-47, which is hereby incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference thereto. Alternatively, endoscope <b>356</b> may be inserted through a guide catheter for delivery of the distal end portion to a desired location. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0321\" num=\"0320\"> Once the distal end of endoscope <b>356</b> has been maneuvered into a desired viewing location, a balloon <b>796</b>, that is mounted annularly around shaft <b>794</b> just proximal of lens <b>790</b>, can be inflated to lift adjacent tissues to improve the visualization through lens <b>790</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0322\" num=\"0321\"> Another feature for anchoring expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>of device <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 34</figref>. This feature includes ratcheted teeth (e.g., spaced teeth <b>800</b> and a collar <b>802</b>. The teeth <b>800</b> are spaced along conduit <b>12</b> and annularly surround the conduit wall to radially extend outward therefrom. Teeth <b>800</b> have an outside diameter at a distal portion thereof that is larger than the inside diameter of collar <b>802</b>, and the proximal end portions of teeth <b>800</b> have an outside diameter that is less than the inside diameter of collar <b>802</b>. Further, teeth <b>800</b> are deformable, and tapered to allow them to be pulled through collar <b>802</b>. As a tooth <b>800</b> passes through collar <b>800</b> it deforms to allow the passage, and then re-expands to its original configuration. Since the distal ends of teeth <b>800</b> are not tapered or beveled, teeth <b>800</b> are prevented from passing back through collar <b>802</b> in the distal direction. Thus, upon insertion, initial placement and expansion of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>the surgeon can next place collar <b>892</b> up against the external surface of the abdominal wall <b>127</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 34</figref>, and pull conduit <b>12</b> proximally therethrough to pull one or more of teeth <b>800</b> through collar <b>802</b>, thereby anchoring expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em </i>to the abdominal wall. The surgeon can adjust the positioning of expandable member <b>10</b> <i>em, </i>according to the number of teeth <b>800</b> that are pulled through collar <b>802</b>, wherein the teeth <b>800</b> and collar <b>802</b> function like a ratchet. The conduit <b>12</b> extending proximally of collar <b>802</b> is connected to access member <b>80</b> which can also be attached to the abdominal wall at another location. This arrangement also relieves stress from access member <b>80</b> and the connection of conduit <b>12</b> with access member <b>80</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0323\" num=\"0322\"> While the present invention has been described with reference to the specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'TECHNICAL FIELD  \\n      The present invention relates to a method of isolating pancreatic islets, which is a critical technology for pancreatic islet transplantation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct, a pancreas preservation solution for the two-layer method, and an islet purification solution, each of which is well-adapted for use in pancreatic islet isolation.  \\n     BACKGROUND ART  \\n      The technique of pancreatic islet transplantation into type-1 diabetic patients, who are unable to survive without the administration of insulin, that is, who are in an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, is garnering a great deal of public awareness and efforts are being made, mainly in Europe and the United States, to establish this technique as a clinical treatment.  \\n      Pancreatic islet transplantation refers to cellular tissue transplantation in which pancreatic islet cell groups, which play a central role in blood sugar regulation in the body, are administered by infusion into the portal vein. Islet transplantation is minimally invasive for the transplant recipient and is regarded as the treatment nearest to ideal for type-1 diabetic patients.  \\n      In 2000, at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, a successful trial of clinical islet transplantation was reported. Since this report, approximately 300 islet transplantations have been performed in the 4 years, mainly in Europe and the United States. These islet transplantations have been carried out on the basis of the Edmonton protocol established at the University of Alberta.  \\n      However, with the technology heretofore, consistent islet yields have not been obtained, even in islet transplantation from brain-dead donors carried out in Europe and the United States, and in some instances the transplanted islets have also not functioned effectively. Moreover, even when considered on a worldwide basis, there have been almost no successful cases of islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, where the conditions are worse than with brain-dead donors, and in fact islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors has to date not been possible.  \\n      To raise the success rates of islet transplantation and also to achieve successful islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, it is important to transplant a large population of islets fit for transplantation. Therefore, there has been strong demand for improvements in islet isolation technology in order to raise the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      On the other hand, in the medical treatment of transplantation, a method has been reported in which ulinastatin or a ulinastatin substitute is administered post-transplant to organ transplant patients (See Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-20309).  \\n      Further, a solution for perfusion or storage of organs that are destined for transplantation has been reported, wherewith excellent results were obtained in lung transplantation (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H6-40801).  \\n      However, an optimal means for islet transplantation, particularly with regard to islet isolation and purification technology, remains elusive.  \\n     DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  \\n     Problems to be Solved by the Invention  \\n      A main object of the present invention is to provide islet isolation techniques that can improve the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n     Means for Solving the Problems  \\n      The present inventors conducted varied and extensive investigations with the main goal of improving islet yields, and as a result, they found that the yield of transplantable islets is raised by the use of special solutions and methods.

Pancreatic Islet Isolation Method  \\n      The pancreatic islet isolation method of the present invention comprises the steps of:  \\n      (1) injecting a protection solution containing a protease inhibitor into the pancreatic duct of an procured pancreas;  \\n      (3) injecting an enzyme solution into the protection solution-injected-pancreas and digesting the pancreas; and  \\n      (4) purifying the digested pancreatic tissue using a purification solution containing a density gradient reagent.  \\n      The present invention also encompasses the method that further contains the step of:  \\n      (2) preserving the protection-solution-injected-pancreas using the two-layer method.  \\n      I(1). Step of Injecting a Protection Solution into the Pancreatic Duct  \\n      The isolation method of the present invention includes a step of injecting a protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution into the pancreatic duct of a pancreas that has been procured from the donor. By injecting the protease-inhibitor-containing preservation solution into the pancreatic duct, the pancreatic tissue is appropriately protected and the yield of transplantable islets is increased  \\n      The volume of protection solution injected into the pancreatic duct can be established as appropriate according to the state of the organ or the like and is approximately 0.1 to 10 ml, preferably approximately 0.1 to 2 ml, and more preferably approximately 1 to 1.5 ml, in each case per 1 gram organ weight.  \\n      The injection of such amounts is preferred from the standpoint of enabling an appropriate perfusion of the protection solution into the pancreatic duct of the entire pancreas and thereby raising the yield of good quality islets.  \\n      The protease inhibitor can be selected as appropriate, but at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is particularly preferred from the standpoint of obtaining an even better islet yield.  \\n      The protection solution preferably has a low potassium concentration from the standpoint of improving the yield of transplantable islets. In specific terms, a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mM, particularly 10 to 50 mM, per 1000 mL protection solution is preferred.  \\n      The protection solution preferably further contains trehalose from the standpoint of increasing the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The timing of protection solution injection can be established as appropriate, but is preferably as soon as possible and is preferably immediately after procurement of the pancreas.  \\n      The method of injecting the protection solution can be established as appropriate; for example, a catheter can be inserted into the procured pancreas and injection can be carried out through this catheter using a pump while regulating the injection pressure.  \\n      The number of inserted catheters can be selected as appropriate, but preferably a single catheter is employed. The use of a single catheter minimizes leakage of the solution injected into the organ and enables a more precise injection of the solution and can also reduce damage to the organ.  \\n      I(2). Step of Preservation Using the Two-Layer Method After the protection solution has been injected into the pancreatic duct, the pancreas is preferably preserved using the two-layer method.  \\n      This two-layer method can be implemented by introducing a liquid perfluorocarbon and a preservation solution into a container so as to form two layers; then feeding oxygen into the container; and preserving the pancreas in an immersed state in the container. The proportion between the liquid perfluorocarbon and preservation solution is about 1:1 as a volume ratio. The oxygen feed is preferably carried out for at least 30 minutes.  \\n      Preservation of the pancreas by the two-layer method enables a high level of tissue viability to be maintained.  \\n      The preservation solution used in the two-layer method preferably contains a protease inhibitor. The islet yield can be increased through this use of a protease-inhibitor-containing preservation solution.  \\n      The protease inhibitor can be selected as appropriate, but at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is particularly apt from the standpoint of obtaining an even better islet yield.  \\n      The preservation solution preferably has a low potassium concentration. In specific terms, the potassium concentration is preferably about 4 to 50 mmol/L and particularly preferably about 10 to 50 mmol/L.  \\n      The use of a preservation solution with a low potassium concentration enables a further increase in the islet yield to be obtained.  \\n      Additionally, the preservation solution preferably further contains trehalose. The use of a preservation solution that contains trehalose enables a further increase in the islet yield to be obtained.  \\n      I(3). Step of Digesting the Pancreas  \\n      Digestion of pancreatic tissue is then carried out on the pancreas into which protection solution has been injected or on the pancreas that has been preserved by the two-layer method.  \\n      Digestion, i.e. degradation, can be carried out, for example, by distending the pancreas by injecting an enzyme solution into the duct of the pancreas and then raising the temperature of the enzyme solution in order to effect enzyme activation.  \\n      Enzyme solution injection can be carried out, for example, by injecting the enzyme solution into the main pancreatic duct using a pump while controlling the injection pressure. The enzyme solution can be injected through the same catheter as used for injection of the protection solution.  \\n      As the enzyme solution, a collagenase solution can be used, for example.  \\n      After the enzyme solution has been injected into the pancreas, digestion can be started by raising the temperature of the solution using a suitable device.  \\n      For example, when a collagenase solution is employed, the distended pancreas is placed in a Ricordi chamber; the digestion circuit is filled with the solution; and the system is closed. The solution is circulated by a pump and the temperature of the solution is raised to around body temperature at about 37\u00b0 C. The collagenase injected into the pancreatic tissue is activated when the temperature is raised, resulting in digestion of the pancreatic tissue through the dissolution of collagen, which forms a tissue that binds the cells to each other.  \\n      Digestion is halted at the point at which just the pancreatic exocrine tissue has been dissociated from around the islets while the cells making up the islets remain intact in their aggregated state.  \\n      Digestion can be halted by lowering the temperature of the solution. Digestion can also be halted by deactivating the enzyme by adding serum protein.  \\n      For example, digestion can be halted by converting the circulation path to an open system and passing a room-temperature solution containing human albumin through the circulation path. The passage of a room-temperature solution can lower the solution temperature and can also dilute the enzyme. The activity of the enzyme can also be reduced by the addition of serum protein.  \\n      The pancreatic tissue is recovered after digestion has been stopped. The recovered pancreatic tissue is preferably centrifugally washed and concentrated with a centrifugal separator prior to purification.  \\n      I(4). Purification Step  \\n      Purification can be carried out utilizing the fact that the islets have a lighter specific gravity than pancreatic exocrine tissue. For example, the digested pancreatic tissue can be added to a solution in which a density gradient, i.e., a specific gravity concentration gradient, has been formed and the islets can be purified by separation of the islets from the pancreatic exocrine tissue by density gradient and centrifugation.  \\n      The following procedure, for example, can be used.  \\n      First, a density gradient is formed in a purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent.  \\n      Then, the digested pancreatic tissue is added to the purification solution in which the density gradient is formed.  \\n      The purification solution loaded with the digested pancreatic tissue is then subjected to centrifugal separation by density gradient and centrifugation. Separating the islets from the exocrine tissue by this centrifugal separation, and the islets are isolated from the recovered pancreatic tissue.  \\n      A density gradient reagent that can form a low viscosity solution is preferred. Suitable density gradient reagents include Iodixanol (Optiprep\u2122) and N,N\u2032-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-[N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)acetoamido]-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide) (Nycodenz\u00ae).  \\n      The purification solution preferably additionally contains a protease inhibitor. A purification solution containing a protease inhibitor can further improve the islet yield.  \\n      The density gradient may be either a continuous density gradient or a discontinuous density gradient; however, a continuous density gradient is preferred because it enables the recovery of more islets.  \\n      The density gradient can be formed as appropriate by known methods. Appropriate apparatus can be used, for example, an instrument that forms a continuous density gradient.  \\n      A cell processor, such as a COBE 2991, can also be utilized for purification.  \\n      For example, a density gradient can be formed in the COBE 2991 using a density gradient reagent; the digested pancreatic tissue, after washing and concentration, can be added thereto; and, after the islets have been separated from the exocrine tissue by continuous density gradient and centrifugation, the solution in the COBE 2991 can be recovered in individual fractions. After separation, the microscopic inspection of the solution is carried out to determine which fractions contain the islets and recover the islets.  \\n      This recovery of the purified islets completes the series of isolation steps.  \\n      II. Protection Solution for Injection into Pancreatic Duct  \\n      The protection solution of the present invention can be used for injection into the pancreatic duct during the isolation of islets for islet transplantation. In addition, the protection solution of the present invention can be very suitably used as the protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution in the isolation method of the present invention described above.  \\n      The protection solution of the present invention can be obtained by adding a protease inhibitor to a tissue protection or preservation solution.  \\n      II-1. Protease Inhibitor  \\n      The protease inhibitor used in the present invention is not particularly limited by its origin and type, as long as it has protease-inhibiting activity. Known protease inhibitors can be suitably used, but a trypsin inhibitor having a trypsin-inhibiting activity is particularly preferred.  \\n      Examples of protease inhibitors include at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin (Miraclid\u2122), 4-[2-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl]fluoride (AEBSF, Pefabloc\u2122), gabexate mesilate (FOY\u2122), and nafamostat mesilate (Fusan\u2122). Among these, at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is preferred for use from the standpoint of further improving the islet yield. Ulinastatin and gabexate mesilate are also preferred for their anti-inflammatory activity.  \\n      The rate of addition of the protease inhibitor to the protection solution can be established as appropriate in accordance with the type of inhibitor and within a range in which the effects of the present invention are achieved. When the protease inhibitor is ulinastatin, the rate of addition is about 10,000 to 100,000 Upper liter and preferably about 50,000 to 100,000 Upper liter. When the protease inhibitor is gabexate mesilate, the rate of addition is about 100 to 10,000 mg per liter and preferably about 500 to 2,000 mg per liter.  \\n      II-2.

In specific terms, a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mM, particularly 10 to 50 mM per 1000 mL protection solution is preferred.  \\n      The use of a low potassium concentration avoids the induction of vasospasm and can thereby prevent insulin release from the islets and enable the solution to quickly spread throughout the tissue. This results in an even higher pancreatic duct protection action and improves the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The osmolarity of the protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct is preferably 270 to 450 mOsm/L and particularly preferably is 300 to 400 mOsm/L. Swelling or shrinkage of the tissue during protection or preservation can be prevented within this range.  \\n      The pH of the protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct is preferably about 7 to 8 in order to stop acidic degradation of the cells and tissue.  \\n      The protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct preferably contains trehalose. The presence of trehalose provides an additional increase in protective action on the pancreatic duct and can thereby improve the islet yield. Trehalose exists in three forms, i.e. \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose, \u03b1,\u03b2-trehalose, and \u03b2,\u03b2-trehalose; any of these may be used and their mixtures may be used. \u03b1,\u03b1-Trehalose, present in nature, is preferably used.  \\n      Trehalose concentration is about 0 to 400 mmol, particularly about 50 to 240 mmol, and even more particularly about 80 to 160 mmol, in each case per 1000 mL of the protection solution.  \\n      The protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct may also contain other components insofar as the effects of the present invention are not impaired. These other components can be exemplified by various electrolytes, sugars, amino acids, drugs, vitamins, and so forth.  \\n      The protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct may also contain a cell activator such as AMP (e.g., dibutyryl cAMP) or ATP, a vasodilator such as prostaglandin or nitroglycerin, antibiotics, adenosine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glycine, ascorbic acid, glutamine, nicotinamide, glutathione, raffinose, and so forth.  \\n      A solution containing at least the following components in the following proportions is an example of a preferred embodiment of the protection solution according to the present invention for injection into the pancreatic duct.  \\n                                                          Sodium   80 to 120   mmol/L           Potassium   4 to 50   mmol/L           Gluconate   15 to 150   mmol/L           Phosphate   20 to 40   mmol/L           Trehalose   80 to 160   mmol/L           Hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES)   20 to 60   g/L           Ulinastatin   10,000 to 100,000   U/L                      \\n \\n      The protection solution according to the present invention for injection into the pancreatic duct has a high protective action on the pancreatic duct and can keep the tissue viablity and can stabilize and satisfactorily protect the tissue and as a result can raise the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      III. Pancreas Preservation Solution for the Two-Layer Method  \\n      The preservation solution according to the present invention can be used for pancreas preservation by the two-layer method during the isolation of islets for islet transplantation. In addition, the pancreas preservation solution according to the present invention for the two-layer method can be very suitably used as the preservation solution used in the two-layer method in the islet isolation method of the present invention described above.  \\n      The preservation solution according to the present invention can be obtained by the addition of a protease inhibitor to a tissue protection or preservation solution that has a low potassium concentration.  \\n      The inhibitors described in II-1 above can be used as the instant protease inhibitor.  \\n      The low-potassium versions of the solutions described in II-2 above can be used as the tissue protection or preservation solution. ET-Kyoto solution is particularly preferred.  \\n      III-2. Embodiments of Pancreas Preservation Solution for the Two-Layer Method  \\n      The amount of protease inhibitor to be added to the preservation solution can be established as appropriate in accordance with the type of inhibitor and within a range in which the effects of the present invention are achieved.  \\n      When the protease inhibitor is ulinastatin, the amount to be added is about 10,000 to 100,000 Upper liter and preferably about 50,000 to 100,000 Upper liter. When the protease inhibitor is gabexate mesilate, the amount to be added is about 100 to 10,000 mg per liter and preferably about 500 to 2000 mg per liter.  \\n      The potassium concentration in the pancreas preservation solution for the two-layer method is about 4 to 50 mM and particularly 10 to 50 mM.  \\n      The use of a low potassium concentration provides an even more satisfactory pancreas preservation activity and can thereby improve the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The osmolarity of the preservation solution is preferably 270 to 450 mOsm/L and is particularly preferably 300 to 400 mOsm/L. Swelling or shrinkage of the tissue during preservation can be prevented within this range.  \\n      The pH of the preservation solution is preferably about 7 to 8 in order to prevent acidic degradation of the cells and tissue.  \\n      The preservation solution preferably contains trehalose.  \\n      Trehalose concentration is about 0 to 400 mmol, particularly about 50 to 240 mmol, and even more particularly about 80 to 160 mmol, in each case per 1000 mL the preservation solution. The presence of trehalose provides an additional increase in pancreas protection activity and can thereby increase the islet yield.  \\n      The preservation solution may also contain other components insofar as the effects of the present invention are not impaired. These other components can be exemplified by various electrolytes, sugars, amino acids, drugs, vitamins, and so forth.  \\n      The preservation solution may also contain a cell activator such as AMP (e.g., dibutyryl cAMP) or ATP, a vasodilator such as prostaglandin or nitroglycerin, antibiotics, adenosine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, glycine, ascorbic acid, glutamine, nicotinamide, glutathione, raffinose, and so forth.  \\n      A solution containing at least the following components in the following proportions is an example of a preferred embodiment of the preservation solution according to the present invention for use in the two-layer method.  \\n                                                          Sodium   80 to 120   mmol/L           Potassium   4 to 50   mmol/L           Gluconate   15 to 150   mmol/L           Phosphate   20 to 40   mmol/L           Trehalose   80 to 160   mmol/L           Hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES)   20 to 60   g/L           Ulinastatin   10,000 to 100,000   U/L                      \\n \\n      Use of the preservation solution according to the present invention provides a highly protective action on the pancreas and can keep the tissue viability intact and can satisfactorily preserve the tissues thereof, and as a result can substantially improve the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      IV. Islet Purification Solution  \\n      The purification solution of the present invention is well-adapted for islet purification in islet isolation during islet transplantation. In addition, the purification solution according to the present invention is well-adapted for use as the purification solution in the islet isolation method according to the present invention described above.  \\n      The purification solution according to the present invention can be obtained by adding a density gradient reagent to a tissue protection or preservation solution that contains trehalose. The trehalose-containing versions of the solutions described in II-2 above can be used as this trehalose-containing tissue protection or preservation solution. The use of ET-Kyoto solution is particularly preferred.  \\n      IV-1. Density Gradient Reagent  \\n      The density gradient reagent can be selected as appropriate from known density gradient reagents used to prepare a density gradient in a solution. A density gradient reagent that can form a low-viscosity solution is particularly preferred. It is also preferred that the density gradient reagent have a low endotoxin level.  \\n      Suitable examples of the density gradient reagent include iodixanol (Optiprep\u2122) and N,N\u2032-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-[N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)acetoamido]-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide (Nycodenz\u00ae). Iodixanol is particularly suitable.  \\n      Using these as the density gradient reagent makes it possible to obtain a low-viscosity purification solution and can expedite the purification speed. In addition, they can provide solutions with a low endotoxin level.  \\n      The mixing proportion of the density gradient reagent with respect to the tissue protection or preservation solution can be established as appropriate by measuring the density of the pancreas tissue prior to purification and considering the specific gravity of the density gradient reagent and the tissue protection or preservation solution.  \\n      IV-2. Trehalose  \\n      Trehalose exists in three forms, i.e. \u03b1,\u03b1-trehalose, \u03b1,\u03b2-trehalose, and \u03b2,\u03b2-trehalose; any of these may be used and their mixtures may be used. \u03b1,\u03b1-Trehalose, present in nature, is preferably used.  \\n      The trehalose concentration in the purification solution is about 0 to 400 mmol/L, particularly 50 to 240 mmol/L, and even more particularly about 80 to 160 mmol/L.  \\n      IV-3. Protease Inhibitor  \\n      The purification solution preferably also contains a protease inhibitor. The protease inhibitors described in II-1 above can be used as this protease inhibitor. In particular, at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is preferred from the standpoint of further improving the islet yield.  \\n      In those cases where a protease inhibitor is added to the purification solution, the rate of addition can be established as appropriate in accordance with the type of inhibitor and within a range in which the effects of the present invention are achieved.  \\n      When the protease inhibitor is ulinastatin, the amount to be added is about 10,000 to 100,000 Upper liter and preferably about 50,000 to 100,000 Upper liter. When the protease inhibitor is gabexate mesilate, the amount to be added is about 100 to 10,000 mg per liter and preferably about 500 to 2,000 mg per liter.  \\n      IV-4. Embodiments of the Purification Solution  \\n      The purification solution preferably has a low potassium concentration, wherein about 4 to 50 mmol/L is preferred and about 10 to 50 mmol/L is particularly preferred.  \\n      The purification solution preferably has a low viscosity. In particular, the viscosity measured by the Brookfield method at a measurement temperature of 22\u00b0 C. should be no greater than 5 centipoise (cP), preferably no greater than 3 cP, and more preferably no greater than 2 cP.  \\n      Other components may be added as appropriate to the purification solution insofar as the effects of the present invention are not impaired. These other components encompass, for example, adenosine, dextran, heparin, and so forth.  \\n      An example of a preferred embodiment of the purification solution is a solution containing at least the following components in the following proportions:  \\n                                                          Sodium   80 to 120   mmol/L           Potassium   4 to 50   mmol/L           Gluconate   15 to 150   mmol/L           Phosphate   20 to 40   mmol/L           Trehalose   80 to 160   mmol/L           Hydroxyl ethyl starch (HES)   20 to 60   g/L           Iodixanol   100 to 500   mL/L                      \\n \\n      An example of a preferred embodiment of the protease-inhibitor-containing purification solution is a solution containing at least the following components in the following proportions:  \\n                                                          Sodium   80 to 120   mmol/L           Potassium   4 to 50   mmol/L           Gluconate   15 to 150   mmol/L           Phosphate   20 to 40   mmol/L           Trehalose   80 to 160   mmol/L           Hydroxyethyl starch (HES)   20 to 60   g/L           Iodixanol   100 to 500   mL/L           Ulinastatin   10,000 to 100,000   U/L                      \\n \\n      In islet purification for transplantation, it is crucial that islet purification be carried out in such a manner that the three-dimensional structure of the islets is preserved. The use of the purification solution according to the present invention makes it possible to raise the yield of transplantable islets residing in a state in which the three-dimensional structure of the islets has been well maintained.  \\n      V. Islet Transplantation  \\n      Islet transplantation can be carried out by infusing the islets obtained by the series of isolation steps described above into the portal vein of a patient.  \\n      When the isolated islets satisfy established criteria, they are judged as suitable for transplantation and are then used for transplantation.  \\n      Viewed from the perspective of efficacy, determination as to whether the islets to be used for transplantation will function as islets post-transplantation is required. In addition, the risk of introducing pathogens, toxic substance, and so forth into the recipient must be excluded to the maximum extent possible.  \\n      In specific terms, the following criteria are used for transplantation-qualified isolated islets.  \\n      Islet Yield&gt;4,000 IE/kg (patient body weight)  \\n      Purity&gt;30%  \\n      Tissue volume&lt;10 ml  \\n      Viability&gt;70%  \\n      Endotoxin&lt;5 IE/kg (patient body weight)  \\n      Negative Gram stain  \\n      An islet yield&gt;5,000 IE/kg (Patient body weight) is more appropriate for carrying out islet transplantation more efficiently.  \\n      Islets that have been evaluated as qualified for transplantation are preserved until the patient (recipient) can be prepared. Once the patient has been prepared, administration is carried out into the portal vein by infusion.  \\n      As necessary, various known techniques for islet transplantation and islet isolation can be added to the technology according to the present invention for islet isolation.  \\n      The present invention increases the yield of transplantable islets. The present invention can also raise the efficiency of purification and can improve the speed of purification. This in turn makes it possible to transplant large numbers of good-quality islets and can bring about a more effective post-transplant islet functionality.  \\n      The use of the isolation method and solutions according to the present invention can improve clinical outcome resulting from islet transplantation.  \\n     EFFECT OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The islet isolation method of the present invention increases the yield of transplantable islets. It also enables islet isolation to be carried out at efficiently in a shorter period of time.  \\n      The islet isolation method of the present invention is characterized by the injection of a protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution into the pancreatic duct.  \\n      This injection of a protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution into the pancreatic duct provides good protection for the pancreatic tissue in the pancreatic duct and thereby improves the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The isolation method of the present invention may also incorporate a step of preserving the pancreas using the two-layer method. Preservation using the two-layer method is preferably carried out using (i) liquid perfluorocarbon and (ii) a preservation solution that contains a protease inhibitor and that has a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mmol/L. This provides a remarkable improvement in the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The isolation method of the present invention further comprises a step of purification using a purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent. Purification is preferably carried out using a purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent and trehalose. Purification is more preferably carried out using a purification solution that further contains a protease inhibitor. The use of these purification solutions raises the efficiency of purification and also improves the cells of the islets fit for transplantation.  \\n      The isolation method of the present invention, because it has the characteristic features cited above, is also characterized by its ability to bring about a substantial increase in the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The present invention further provides a protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct. This protection solution has a highly protective effect upon the pancreatic duct and thereby brings about an increase in the islet yield.  \\n      The present invention further provides a pancreas preservation solution for the two-layer method, said solution containing protease inhibitor and having a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mmol/L. This preservation solution is highly protective of the pancreas and maintains tissue viability and provides thorough tissue protection, thereby increasing the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The present invention further provides an islet purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent and trehalose. The present invention further provides a purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent, trehalose, and a protease inhibitor. These purification solutions can raise the efficiency of purification and can also raise the yield of transplantable islets. The lowered viscosity of these purification solutions can boost the speed of purification. Moreover, they have low endotoxin levels and can also lower the risk to the patient.  \\n      Thus, the present invention provides an islet isolation method, a protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct, a pancreas preservation solution for the two-layer method, and an islet purification solution, each of which can raise the yield of transplantable islets.  \\n      The present invention raises the yield of islets that satisfy the qualifying criteria for transplantation and as a consequence can increase the success rate of islet transplantation. Moreover, the present invention makes it possible to realize islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, which in fact has not been possible with prior-art methods.  \\n      As a consequence of the preceding, the present invention can provide a more reliable and more effective treatment for insulin-dependent diabetics and particularly type-I diabetic patients and substantially contributes to the clinical implementation of islet transplantation. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  shows the results of an experiment that compared islet yield with protection of the pancreatic duct against the islet yield without protection of the pancreatic duct.

Purification Solutions  \\n      Ficoll solution was prepared by mixing two Ficoll solutions (Ficoll\u2122, Pharmacia Corporation) having different concentrations (dilution with Hanks&#39; solution) so as to provide a light specific gravity of about 1.07 to 1.08 and a heavy specific gravity of 1.09 to 1.12.  \\n      ET-Kyoto+iodixanol solution (hereinafter also referred to as I-Kyoto solution) was prepared by mixing a 60 weight % aqueous iodixanol solution (OptiPrep\u2122, made by AXIS-SHIELD) with ET-Kyoto solution.  \\n      ET-Kyoto+ulinastatin+iodixanol solution (hereinafter also referred to as MI-Kyoto solution) was prepared by mixing 60 weight % aqueous iodixanol solution (OptiPrep\u2122, made by AXIS-SHIELD plc) with M-Kyoto solution. ET-Kyoto+Pefabloc+iodixanol solution (hereinafter also referred to as Kyoto+AEBSF+Idx solution) was prepared by mixing 4-[2-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl] fluoride.HCl (Pefabloc\u2122, made by Roche Diagnostics) and 60 weight % aqueous iodixanol solution (OptiPrep\u2122, made by AXIS-SHIELD plc) with ET-Kyoto solution.  \\n      The ET-Kyoto solution had a specific gravity of about 1.04 and the iodixanol solution had a specific gravity of approximately 1.32. When these were mixed, a light specific gravity of about 1.07 to 1.08 and a heavy specific gravity of 1.09 to 1.12 were prepared by changing the ratio between the two solutions.  \\n      2. Procedure for Porcine Islets Isolation  \\n      Porcine islets were isolated using the following procedure.  \\n      Porcine pancreatic tissues were obtained at a slaughterhouse in Kyoto. After pancreas procurement, (1) the pancreases were immediately preserved in a container in which two layers had been formed by the two-layer method or (2) a catheter was inserted into each pancreas immediately after procurement and pancreatic duct protection solution was injected through the catheter into the main pancreatic duct of each pancreas and the pancreases were thereafter quickly preserved in a container in which two layers had been formed by the two-layer method, the two layers being PFC and preservation solution. The volume of pancreatic duct protection solution injected in (2) was 1 mL per 1 gram pancreas weight.  \\n      Here, the time from heart beat cessation to immersion of the pancreas in the preservation solution is defined as the warm ischemic time. The time from immersion of the pancreas in the preservation solution to the start of islet separation is defined as the cold ischemic time.  \\n      The pancreas preserved by the two-layer method was transported to the islet isolation facility at the University of Kyoto and was then decontaminated.  \\n      A cold collagenase solution (Liberase HI\u2122, made by Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then injected into the main duct of the pancreas and the pancreas was distended while the solution was circulated.  \\n      The distended pancreas was cut into nine pieces and placed in a Ricordi chamber. The circulation path in this chamber was filled with solution and the system was closed. Then, while circulating the solution with a pump, the temperature of the solution was raised to about 37\u00b0 C. to activate the collagenase and the pancreatic tissue was digested by repeatedly circulating the collagenase solution through the Ricordi chamber. The digestion process was stopped at the point at which just the pancreatic exocrine tissue had been dissociated from around the islets while the cells making up the islets remained intact in their aggregated state.  \\n      To stop digestion, the collagenase was deactivated by lowering the temperature of the solution by opening the circulation path and passing a human-albumin-containing solution at room temperature through the circulation path.  \\n      The pancreatic tissue was recovered after digestion had been halted, by passage of the room temperature solution through the circulation path.  \\n      The time from placement of the pancreas in the Ricordi chamber to the start of recovery of the digested pancreatic tissue was designated as phase 1.  \\n      The time from the start of recovery until recovery was complete was designated as phase 2.  \\n      The recovered pancreatic tissue was centrifugally washed with a centrifugal separator and was aggregated and concentrated.  \\n      A continuous density gradient was formed in a blood cell washing instrument (COBE 2991 cell processor, Gambro BCT) using a purification solution that contained a density gradient reagent.  \\n      The washed and concentrated pancreatic tissue was then added to the solution in which the density gradient had been formed.  \\n      Purification was carried out by isolating the islets from the pancreatic tissue by carrying out centrifugal separation using the continuous density gradient and centrifugation technique to separate the islets from the pancreatic exocrine tissue. After this, the solution in the blood cell washing instrument was collected into individual fractions and a microscopic examination administered to determine which fractions the islets were present in, and the islets were then recovered.  \\n      3. Evaluation Methods  \\n      The islet yield and purity were evaluated by dithizone staining. After dithizone staining a 100 \u03bcL sample was taken from the solution suspended in 200 mL and the islet yield was evaluated under a microscope by individual sizes. The purity was given by the proportion of the islets in the total mass inclusive of all elements, e.g., islets, exocrine tissue in addition to the islets, pancreatic duct, and so forth.  \\n      The islet size was obtained as an average of the islets enumerated by individual sizes.  \\n      The efficiency of purification was obtained by dividing the number of islets after purification by the number of islets before purification.  \\n      The morphological score (gross morphological evaluation) was qualitatively assessed by having two investigators score the following: shape (flat versus spherical), border (irregular versus well-rounded), integrity (fragmented versus solid/compact), staining quality (uniform versus non-uniform), and diameter (all&lt;100 \u03bcL versus&gt;10%&gt;200 \u03bcL). Each parameter was scored from 0 to 2 with 0 being the lowest score and 2 being the highest score. The lowest total score for islet isolation was therefore 0 and the highest was 10. Spherical, well-rounded, solid or compact, uniformly stained, and large diameter islets were characterized and scored as preferred islets.  \\n      Islet viability was assessed by the simultaneous visualization of live and dead cells using acridine orange (10 \u03bcmol/L) and propidium iodide (15 \u03bcmol/L) (AO/PI). 50 islets were investigated and the viability in each one was visually determined and the mean thereof was calculated.  \\n      The stimulation index was calculated from the ratio between insulin secretion at a high glucose concentration to that at a low glucose concentration.  \\n      Islet function was assessed according to the method of Shapiro and Colleagues by monitoring the insulin secretion response of the purified islets to glucose challenge. In brief, 100 Islet Equivalents (IE) were incubated on CMRL solution at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO 2  atmosphere and then incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO 2  atmosphere on RPMI1640 solution (GIBCO BRL) containing 2.8 mM ether or 20 mM ether and 20 mM glucose; the supernatant was recovered and the insulin value was measured with an ELISA kit (Morinaga Biochemical Industry Co., Ltd.) using an antigen-antibody reaction.  \\n      The values obtained in the examples and experimental examples were reported using a mean and standard deviation (mean \u00b1SE). Comparisons were made among the three groups using the mean of ANOVA and Fisher&#39;s PLSD post-hoc test. Values with a P value less than 0.05 were taken as significant.  \\n     EXAMPLE 1  \\n     Investigation of Pancreatic Duct Protection  \\n      Comparative experiments were carried out using the procedure described above in order to carry out a comparative investigation of the presence/absence of pancreatic duct protection. The procedures were identical, except that after pancreas procurement, (1) preservation by the two-layer method was immediately carried out (no pancreatic duct protection) or (2) protection solution was injected into the main duct of the pancreas immediately after procurement followed by preservation by the two-layer method (implementation of pancreatic duct protection).  \\n      In these experiments, M-Kyoto solution was used as the pancreatic duct protection solution. M-Kyoto solution and liquid PFC were used in the two-layer method. Ficoll solution was used as the purification solution.  \\n      The islet yields obtained in these experiments before and after purification are shown in  FIG. 1  ( 1 A: Before purification,  1 B: After purification) and the following table. IE/g denotes the mean number of islets per 1 gram pancreas.  \\n                       TABLE 2                                      Islet Yield (IE/g)                             Before Purification   After Purification                                     No Pancreatic Duct   6,889 \u00b1 749   3,662 \u00b1 320\\u2002       Protection (\u2212)       Implementation of Pancreatic   10,626 \u00b1 2153   4,807 \u00b1 1227       Duct Protection (+)                  \\n \\n      As shown in Table 2, both before purification and after purification, it was demonstrated that the islet yield with pancreatic duct protection (implementation of pancreatic duct protection) was significantly higher, than in the absence of pancreatic duct protection.  \\n      The other characteristics of the islets are shown in Table 3 below.  \\n                           TABLE 3                                       Implementation of           No Pancreatic Duct   Pancreatic Duct           Protection (\u2212)   Protection (+)                                                Viability   95.3 \u00b1 1.5\\u2002   96.2 \u00b1 1.2\\u2002       Morphological score   7.4 \u00b1 0.7   7.8 \u00b1 0.6       Purity (%)   86.3 \u00b1 3.8\\u2002   91.3 \u00b1 4.3\\u2002       Stimulation Index   1.7 \u00b1 0.3   2.6 \u00b1 1.4                  \\n \\n      As shown in Table 3, no significant difference was seen between the two groups with regard to the other islet characteristics.  \\n     EXAMPLE 2  \\n     Comparative Investigations on Preservation by the Two-Layer Method  \\n      In order to perform comparative investigations of the use of different solutions in the two-layer method, comparative investigations were carried out using the same procedure, but using the different solutions shown in Table 4 for the two-layer method. The M-UW solution was obtained by adding 100,000 units (U) ulinastatin to 1 L UW solution.  \\n      The experiments were carried out using the following procedure.  \\n      Islets were isolated from inbred male Lewis rats weighing from 300 to 380 grams (Chaeles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.). The rat studies were approved by the Review Committee of the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine. The common bile duct was cannulated using a 24-gauge catheter (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) and fixed and the end was then clamped. The pancreas, spleen, and duodenum were removed en bloc and preserved in the particular solution. The pancreas was preserved for 6 hours at 4\u00b0 C. The islets were isolated using the modified method of Sawada (Transplantation. 2003; 75(12): 1965-1969). After preservation, each pancreas was distended using a 2 mg/mL collagenase solution (24 mg Serva collagenase, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 12 mL Hanks&#39; Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). The spleen and duodenum were removed and the pancreas was incubated for 22 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in a 50 mL conical tube without shaking. The digested pancreas was washed three times with UW solution by centrifugal separation (150 g, 3 minutes, 8\u00b0 C.). It was then purified with a discontinuous density gradient (1.030, 1.095, 1.105, 1.125 g/cm 3 ) formed using a solution of iodixanol (Optiprep\u2122, Nycomed Pharma AS, Oslo, Norway) added to M-Kyoto solution. The resulting islet yield was assessed by dithizone staining.  \\n      The results of the post-purification islet yield are shown in  FIG. 2  and Table 4. IE/pancreas denotes the total islet yield taken from each individual pancreas.  \\n                           TABLE 4                                   Solution Used in the Two-Layer   Post-Purification Islet Yield           Method   (IE/pancreas)                          UW/PFC   622 \u00b1 133           M-UW/PFC   730 \u00b1 114           ET-Kyoto/PFC   700 \u00b1 116           M-Kyoto/PFC   1207 \u00b1 76\\u2003                      \\n \\n      As shown in Table 4 and  FIG. 2 , the post-purification islet yield was found to be significantly higher with the use of M-Kyoto solution for preservation in the two-layer method.  \\n     EXAMPLE 3  \\n     Investigation of the Isolation Protocol  \\n      3-1.

Islet Yields  \\n      The islet yields before and after purification in the individual isolation protocols are shown in Table 7 below and in  FIGS. 3A and 3B .

The ** in the table indicates that the Kyoto protocol gave a substantially higher efficiency of purification than the C1 protocol (P &lt; 0.05) and the C2 protocol (P &lt; 0.01).            The *** in the table indicates that the Kyoto protocol gave a substantially larger post-purification islet size than the C2 protocol (P &lt; 0.04).             \\n \\n      As shown in Table 8, there was no significant difference in stimulation index, viability, purity, or pre-purification islet size among the three groups.  \\n      However, it was found that the results with the Kyoto protocol for the morphological score, efficiency of purification, and post-purification islet size were particularly good.  \\n      3-2(4). Purification Speed  \\n      The purification speeds in the individual isolation protocols were investigated. As a result, it was found that the purification solution could be delivered into the COBE 2991 cell processor at a rate of 60 ml/min in the Kyoto protocol.  \\n      Against this, the purification solution delivery rate in the C1 and C2 protocols, which used Ficoll solution as the purification solution, was 10 to 20 ml/min.  \\n      These results showed that the rate of islet purification could be speed up by 3- to 6-fold using iodixanol as the density gradient reagent. The primary factor for this result was thought to be the low viscosity of the purification solution when iodixanol was used.  \\n     EXAMPLE 4  \\n     Investigation of Protease Inhibitor  \\n      The following experiment was carried out in order to examine the type of protease inhibitor.  \\n      Islet yield was assessed using the same procedure as described above for the Kyoto protocol, with the exception that the solutions described in Table 9 were used for the protection solution injected into the main pancreatic duct and the preservation solution in the two-layer method.  \\n                           TABLE 9                                   Protection Solution and               Preservation Solution   Islet Yield (IE/g)                          ET-Kyoto Solution   2103           ET-Kyoto + AEBSF Solution   3448           M-Kyoto Solution   7253           (ET-Kyoto + Ulinastatin Solution)           ET-Kyoto + Gabexate Mesilate   7140           Solution                      \\n \\n      These results demonstrate that islet yield was increased when a protease inhibitor was added to the protection solution injected into the pancreatic duct.  \\n      It was found in particular that islet yield was substantially raised when the protease inhibitor was ulinastatin or gabexate mesilate.  \\n      In addition, the use of ET-Kyoto+gabexate mesilate solution as the protection solution injected into the main pancreatic duct and as the preservation solution in the two-layer method yielded a purity of 89% and a viability of 90% for the isolated islets.  \\n     EXAMPLE 5  \\n     Investigation of Purification  \\n      Further investigations were carried out using different purification solutions as follows.  \\n      The efficiency of purification was assessed by the method described above using the Kyoto protocol described in the above porcine islet isolation procedure, with the exception that the purification solutions shown in Table 10 were used.  \\n                   TABLE 10                       Purification Solution   Efficiency of purification (%)                  I-Kyoto Solution   64       I-Kyoto + AEBSF Solution   70       MI-Kyoto Solution (I-Kyoto + ulinastatin   80       solution)                  \\n \\n      As is shown in Table 10, the efficiency of purification was found to be increased when a protease-inhibitor-containing solution was used as the purification solution.  \\n      In particular, the use of MI-Kyoto solution, that is, the use of ulinastatin as the protease inhibitor, was found to provide a substantial increase in efficiency of purification.  \\n      Further, just as for the use of 1-Kyoto solution, the use of MI-Kyoto solution also enabled the purification solution to be delivered into the COBE 2991 cell processor at a rate of 60 ml/min.  \\n     EXAMPLE 6  \\n     Human Islet Isolation  \\n      6-1. Procedure for Human Islet Isolation  \\n      Human islet isolation was carried out using the same procedure as for porcine islet isolation, except for the points noted below.  \\n      With informed consent in place, thirteen human pancreases were acquired from non-heart-beating donors through the Central Japan Region and the Western Japan Region of the Japan Organ Transplant Network.  \\n      A catheter was inserted in order to rapidly cool the pancreases via the blood vessels of the donor&#39;s inguinal region and cold lactated Ringer&#39;s solution was injected through this catheter and circulated from after heart beat cessation until removal of the pancreas.  \\n      The pancreases were then removed and a catheter was immediately inserted and M-Kyoto solution was injected into the main pancreatic duct at the rate of 1 ml per 1 gram pancreas weight. This was quickly followed by immersion of the pancreases in the preservation solution of a two-layer method preservation container. The pancreases were then transported to the GMP-grade Center for Cell and Molecular Therapy at Kyoto University. The two-layer method used M-Kyoto solution and liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC).  \\n      The assessment procedures were the same as in the previously described porcine islet isolation procedure. Statistical evaluation was also the same as for porcine islet isolation.  \\n      6-2. Isolation Protocol  \\n      Isolation of human islets was carried out by the C2 protocol in 2 of the thirteen cases and was carried out by the Kyoto protocol in 11 of the thirteen cases.  \\n      6-3. Characteristics of Human Donors and Pancreases  \\n      The mean donor age was 44\u00b14 years. The period of ICU stay was 11\u00b13 days. The BMI was 21\u00b11 kg/m 2 . The pancreas size was 87\u00b16 g. Abnormalities were observed in the average blood chemistry values of all the donors.  \\n      The warm ischemic time was 7\u00b13 minutes. The cold ischemic time was 256\u00b118 minutes. The warm ischemic time for all the pancreases was minimized by the immediate circulation with cold lactated Ringer&#39;s solution. In addition, the cold ischemic time was shorter than 6 hours in all cases.  \\n      There were no significant differences between the two protocols with regard to donor conditions, warm ischemic time, and cold ischemic time.  \\n      6-4. Assessment of Isolation Protocols  \\n      The results of the assessment of human islet isolation are shown in Table 11 for the two protocols (C2 protocol, Kyoto protocol). The islet yield (IE) indicates the total islet yield.  \\n                           TABLE 11                                   C2 Protocol (N = 2)   Kyoto Protocol (N = 11)                                                Pre-Purification   733,620 \u00b1 249,440   526,657 \u00b1 67,695       Islet Yield (IE)       Post-Purification   339,480 \u00b1 14,905\\u2002   410,376 \u00b1 42,412       Islet Yield (IE)       Efficiency of   51 \u00b1 15   81 \u00b1 5       purification (%)       Purity (%)   50 \u00b1 10   51 \u00b1 6       Viability (%)   94 \u00b1 6\\u2002   97 \u00b1 1       Morphological score   9.0 \u00b1 1.0   \\u20029.8 \u00b1 0.1       Tissue Volume (mL)   8.0 \u00b1 1.0   \\u20026.4 \u00b1 0.8       Negative Gram Stain   2/2   11/11       Endotoxin (EU)   14.4 \u00b1 11.0   \\u20028.7 \u00b1 3.6       Transplant Criteria   2/2   11/11       Qualification       Transplanted   1/2   10/11                  \\n \\n      There were no significant differences between the two protocols in the pre-purification islet yield or post-purification islet yield. The same results are also obtained in the purity, viability, and morphological score between the two protocols.  \\n      The efficiency of purification was 1.6-times higher in the Kyoto protocol than in the C2 protocol. The endotoxin level was lower for the Kyoto protocol than for the C2 protocol.  \\n      With regard to the purification speed, the purification solution could be delivered into the COBE 2991 cell processor at the rate of 60 ml/min in the Kyoto protocol. This rate was 10 to 20 ml/min for the C2 protocol.  \\n      Based on these results, it was confirmed that the use of 1-Kyoto solution as the purification solution also provides a 3- to 6-times faster islet purification speed in human islet isolation.  \\n      The following tests were also carried out with the purification solution.  \\n      The efficiency of purification and islet yield were assessed using the same procedures as the Kyoto protocol in the above-described human islet isolation, except that the purification solutions shown in Table 12 were used.  \\n                               TABLE 12                                       Efficiency of   Total Islet Yield           Purification Solution   purification (%)   (IE)                                                        I-Kyoto Solution   78   479409           MI-Kyoto Solution   84.2   544535                      \\n \\n      As shown in Table 12, it was found that the efficiency of purification was also raised in human islet isolation when a protease-inhibitor-containing solution was used as the purification solution. It was additionally found that the islet yield was also raised.  \\n      6-5. Transplant Qualifying Criteria  \\n      The following transplant qualifying criteria were established based on the Edmonton protocol.  \\n      Islet Yield&gt;5,000 IE/kg (patient body weight)  \\n      Purity&gt;30%  \\n      Tissue volume&lt;10 mL  \\n      Viability&gt;70%  \\n      Endotoxin&lt;5 IE/kg (patient body weight)  \\n      Negative Gram stain  \\n      With regard to these criteria, all thirteen cases satisfied the transplant qualifying criteria, with the exception of islet yield.  \\n      6-6. Islet Transplantation into Type-I Diabetic Patients  \\n      Of the thirteen cases described above, eleven cases, that is, one case of those islets isolated according to the C2 protocol and ten cases of those islets isolated according to the Kyoto protocol were transplanted into six type-I diabetic patients. The islets isolated in the remaining two cases were cryopreserved.  \\n      Four of the six patients received multiple-donor islet transplants. Two patients received single-donor islet transplants.  \\n      The assessments made after islet transplantation were carried out using the following methods.  \\n      The serum blood glucose, insulin requirement, and hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) were assessed daily before and after transplantation. The glucagon stimulation test was carried out before transplantation, on the 30 th  and 60th day after the first transplantation, and on the 30 th  day and 60 th  day after the second transplantation. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was taken for C-peptide measurement immediately before the injection of 1 mg glucagon and 6 minutes after the injection.  \\n      6-7. Assessment After Islet Transplantation  \\n      After islet transplantation, none of the six patients suffered from hypoglycemic unawareness and an improved blood glucose control could be observed in all six. In addition, the start of insulin secretion was confirmed in all of the transplant cases based on C-peptide measurement.  \\n      While the mean insulin amount was 39.2\u00b13.2 units at the time of transplantation, it fell to 11.0\u00b14.4 units (P&lt;0.0005). Two patients became insulin free; in two other patients the amount of insulin declined to below 10 units; and in the two other patients the amount of insulin also declined.  \\n      The HbAlC level gradually declined in all six patients, and in all six patients the HbAlc level reached normal at about 3 months after islet transplantation, regardless of whether the transplantation was from a single donor or multiple donors ( FIG. 4A ).  \\n      The mean HbAlc level of the six patients underwent substantial improvement, improving from 7.5\u00b10.4% at the time of transplantation to 5.1\u00b10.2% (P&lt;0.0003).  \\n      Prior to transplantation, all the patients had undetectable C-peptide values (&lt;0.1 ng/ml), while post-transplant the C-peptide values could be detected. With regard to the C-peptide values after the first transplantation, the basal value was 0.29\u00b10.06 ng/ml and the post-stimulation value was 0.52\u00b10.11 ng/ml (N=6) ( FIG. 4B ). Both the basal C-peptide value and the post-stimulation C-peptide value were substantially improved after the second islet transplantation from the values for the first transplantation. After the second transplantation, the basal C-peptide value was 0.75\u00b10.12 ng/ml (P&lt;0.01) and the post-stimulation value was 1.45\u00b10.26 ng/ml (P&lt;0.005) (N=3) ( FIG. 4B ).  \\n      6-8. Clinical Islet Transplantation  \\n      Islet transplantation was carried out in a clinical setting in accordance with the Kyoto protocol described above. A second transplantation was carried out in the same manner on the same patient after about 2 months.  \\n      The islet yield for the first transplantation was 354,384 IE and for the second transplantation was 474,234 IE.  \\n      The recipient was a 36-year-old female with a 22-year history of type I diabetes; there had been frequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia and there was a history of diabetic retinopathy.  \\n      Kidney function was normal and creatinine level was 0.7 mg/dl. Immunosuppressives were administered on day 0 and day 4 post-transplantation in accordance with the Edmonton protocol, with the exception that 20 mg basiliximab was used instead of daclizumab.  \\n      To provide a pre-transplantation blood glucose level control, blood glucose was measured before breakfast and before dinner at approximately 2 month intervals for approximately the preceding 2 years.  \\n      Blood glucose prior to islet transplantation was very unstable and ranged broadly from 20 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl.  \\n      After the first transplantation, however, blood glucose was maintained in a narrow range and settled into a narrow range from 50 mg/dL to 150 mg/dL ( FIG. 5A ).  \\n      The pre-transplantation insulin requirement was from 30 to 40 unit/day; however, the insulin intake gradually declined to 10 unit/day by 1 month after the first transplantation. Moreover, the patient was able to completely stop and achieve insulin free on day 20 after the second transplantation ( FIG. 5B ).  \\n      The transaminase value temporarily increased after the first transplantation, but did not reach or exceed 100 mg/dl and returned to normal values within 3 weeks. The creatinine value remained at or below 1.0 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) stayed at normal values during the entire period of observation.  \\n      As is clear from the results given above, the present invention has been shown to raise efficiency of purification and to raise the yield of islets that satisfy the transplant qualifying criteria. In addition, the present invention has been shown to raise the purification speed and to enable islet isolation with good efficiency in a short period of time.  \\n      Moreover, the present invention has been shown to have the ability to acquire good amounts of good-quality islets from non-heart-beating donors. The present invention has also been shown to be highly successful with regard to islet transplantation from human non-heart-beating donors.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

More particularly, the present invention relates to a protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct, a pancreas preservation solution for the two-layer method, and an islet purification solution, each of which is well-adapted for use in pancreatic islet isolation. </p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">BACKGROUND ART </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\"> The technique of pancreatic islet transplantation into type-1 diabetic patients, who are unable to survive without the administration of insulin, that is, who are in an insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, is garnering a great deal of public awareness and efforts are being made, mainly in Europe and the United States, to establish this technique as a clinical treatment. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\"> Pancreatic islet transplantation refers to cellular tissue transplantation in which pancreatic islet cell groups, which play a central role in blood sugar regulation in the body, are administered by infusion into the portal vein. Islet transplantation is minimally invasive for the transplant recipient and is regarded as the treatment nearest to ideal for type-1 diabetic patients. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\"> In 2000, at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, a successful trial of clinical islet transplantation was reported. Since this report, approximately 300 islet transplantations have been performed in the 4 years, mainly in Europe and the United States. These islet transplantations have been carried out on the basis of the Edmonton protocol established at the University of Alberta. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\"> However, with the technology heretofore, consistent islet yields have not been obtained, even in islet transplantation from brain-dead donors carried out in Europe and the United States, and in some instances the transplanted islets have also not functioned effectively. Moreover, even when considered on a worldwide basis, there have been almost no successful cases of islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, where the conditions are worse than with brain-dead donors, and in fact islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors has to date not been possible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\"> To raise the success rates of islet transplantation and also to achieve successful islet transplantation from non-heart-beating donors, it is important to transplant a large population of islets fit for transplantation. Therefore, there has been strong demand for improvements in islet isolation technology in order to raise the yield of transplantable islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\"> On the other hand, in the medical treatment of transplantation, a method has been reported in which ulinastatin or a ulinastatin substitute is administered post-transplant to organ transplant patients (See Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-20309). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\"> Further, a solution for perfusion or storage of organs that are destined for transplantation has been reported, wherewith excellent results were obtained in lung transplantation (refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. H6-40801). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\"> However, an optimal means for islet transplantation, particularly with regard to islet isolation and purification technology, remains elusive. </p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">Problems to be Solved by the Invention </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\"> A main object of the present invention is to provide islet isolation techniques that can improve the yield of transplantable islets. </p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">Means for Solving the Problems </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\"> The present inventors conducted varied and extensive investigations with the main goal of improving islet yields, and as a result, they found that the yield of transplantable islets is raised by the use of special solutions and methods.

Pancreatic Islet Isolation Method </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\"> The pancreatic islet isolation method of the present invention comprises the steps of: </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\"> (1) injecting a protection solution containing a protease inhibitor into the pancreatic duct of an procured pancreas; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\"> (3) injecting an enzyme solution into the protection solution-injected-pancreas and digesting the pancreas; and </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\"> (4) purifying the digested pancreatic tissue using a purification solution containing a density gradient reagent. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\"> The present invention also encompasses the method that further contains the step of: </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\"> (2) preserving the protection-solution-injected-pancreas using the two-layer method. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0007\" num=\"0000\"> I(1). Step of Injecting a Protection Solution into the Pancreatic Duct </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\"> The isolation method of the present invention includes a step of injecting a protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution into the pancreatic duct of a pancreas that has been procured from the donor. By injecting the protease-inhibitor-containing preservation solution into the pancreatic duct, the pancreatic tissue is appropriately protected and the yield of transplantable islets is increased </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\"> The volume of protection solution injected into the pancreatic duct can be established as appropriate according to the state of the organ or the like and is approximately 0.1 to 10 ml, preferably approximately 0.1 to 2 ml, and more preferably approximately 1 to 1.5 ml, in each case per 1 gram organ weight. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\"> The injection of such amounts is preferred from the standpoint of enabling an appropriate perfusion of the protection solution into the pancreatic duct of the entire pancreas and thereby raising the yield of good quality islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\"> The protease inhibitor can be selected as appropriate, but at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is particularly preferred from the standpoint of obtaining an even better islet yield. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\"> The protection solution preferably has a low potassium concentration from the standpoint of improving the yield of transplantable islets. In specific terms, a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mM, particularly 10 to 50 mM, per 1000 mL protection solution is preferred. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\"> The protection solution preferably further contains trehalose from the standpoint of increasing the yield of transplantable islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\"> The timing of protection solution injection can be established as appropriate, but is preferably as soon as possible and is preferably immediately after procurement of the pancreas. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\"> The method of injecting the protection solution can be established as appropriate; for example, a catheter can be inserted into the procured pancreas and injection can be carried out through this catheter using a pump while regulating the injection pressure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\"> The number of inserted catheters can be selected as appropriate, but preferably a single catheter is employed. The use of a single catheter minimizes leakage of the solution injected into the organ and enables a more precise injection of the solution and can also reduce damage to the organ. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\"> I(2). Step of Preservation Using the Two-Layer Method After the protection solution has been injected into the pancreatic duct, the pancreas is preferably preserved using the two-layer method. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\"> This two-layer method can be implemented by introducing a liquid perfluorocarbon and a preservation solution into a container so as to form two layers; then feeding oxygen into the container; and preserving the pancreas in an immersed state in the container. The proportion between the liquid perfluorocarbon and preservation solution is about 1:1 as a volume ratio. The oxygen feed is preferably carried out for at least 30 minutes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\"> Preservation of the pancreas by the two-layer method enables a high level of tissue viability to be maintained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\"> The preservation solution used in the two-layer method preferably contains a protease inhibitor. The islet yield can be increased through this use of a protease-inhibitor-containing preservation solution. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\"> The protease inhibitor can be selected as appropriate, but at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is particularly apt from the standpoint of obtaining an even better islet yield. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\"> The preservation solution preferably has a low potassium concentration. In specific terms, the potassium concentration is preferably about 4 to 50 mmol/L and particularly preferably about 10 to 50 mmol/L. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\"> The use of a preservation solution with a low potassium concentration enables a further increase in the islet yield to be obtained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\"> Additionally, the preservation solution preferably further contains trehalose. The use of a preservation solution that contains trehalose enables a further increase in the islet yield to be obtained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0008\" num=\"0000\"> I(3). Step of Digesting the Pancreas </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\"> Digestion of pancreatic tissue is then carried out on the pancreas into which protection solution has been injected or on the pancreas that has been preserved by the two-layer method. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\"> Digestion, i.e. degradation, can be carried out, for example, by distending the pancreas by injecting an enzyme solution into the duct of the pancreas and then raising the temperature of the enzyme solution in order to effect enzyme activation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\"> Enzyme solution injection can be carried out, for example, by injecting the enzyme solution into the main pancreatic duct using a pump while controlling the injection pressure. The enzyme solution can be injected through the same catheter as used for injection of the protection solution. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\"> As the enzyme solution, a collagenase solution can be used, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\"> After the enzyme solution has been injected into the pancreas, digestion can be started by raising the temperature of the solution using a suitable device. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\"> For example, when a collagenase solution is employed, the distended pancreas is placed in a Ricordi chamber; the digestion circuit is filled with the solution; and the system is closed. The solution is circulated by a pump and the temperature of the solution is raised to around body temperature at about 37\u00b0 C. The collagenase injected into the pancreatic tissue is activated when the temperature is raised, resulting in digestion of the pancreatic tissue through the dissolution of collagen, which forms a tissue that binds the cells to each other. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\"> Digestion is halted at the point at which just the pancreatic exocrine tissue has been dissociated from around the islets while the cells making up the islets remain intact in their aggregated state. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\"> Digestion can be halted by lowering the temperature of the solution. Digestion can also be halted by deactivating the enzyme by adding serum protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\"> For example, digestion can be halted by converting the circulation path to an open system and passing a room-temperature solution containing human albumin through the circulation path. The passage of a room-temperature solution can lower the solution temperature and can also dilute the enzyme. The activity of the enzyme can also be reduced by the addition of serum protein. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\"> The pancreatic tissue is recovered after digestion has been stopped. The recovered pancreatic tissue is preferably centrifugally washed and concentrated with a centrifugal separator prior to purification. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0009\" num=\"0000\"> I(4). Purification Step </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\"> Purification can be carried out utilizing the fact that the islets have a lighter specific gravity than pancreatic exocrine tissue. For example, the digested pancreatic tissue can be added to a solution in which a density gradient, i.e., a specific gravity concentration gradient, has been formed and the islets can be purified by separation of the islets from the pancreatic exocrine tissue by density gradient and centrifugation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\"> The following procedure, for example, can be used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\"> First, a density gradient is formed in a purification solution that contains a density gradient reagent. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\"> Then, the digested pancreatic tissue is added to the purification solution in which the density gradient is formed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\"> The purification solution loaded with the digested pancreatic tissue is then subjected to centrifugal separation by density gradient and centrifugation. Separating the islets from the exocrine tissue by this centrifugal separation, and the islets are isolated from the recovered pancreatic tissue. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\"> A density gradient reagent that can form a low viscosity solution is preferred. Suitable density gradient reagents include Iodixanol (Optiprep\u2122) and N,N\u2032-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-[N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)acetoamido]-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide) (Nycodenz\u00ae). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\"> The purification solution preferably additionally contains a protease inhibitor. A purification solution containing a protease inhibitor can further improve the islet yield. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\"> The density gradient may be either a continuous density gradient or a discontinuous density gradient; however, a continuous density gradient is preferred because it enables the recovery of more islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\"> The density gradient can be formed as appropriate by known methods. Appropriate apparatus can be used, for example, an instrument that forms a continuous density gradient. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\"> A cell processor, such as a COBE 2991, can also be utilized for purification. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\"> For example, a density gradient can be formed in the COBE 2991 using a density gradient reagent; the digested pancreatic tissue, after washing and concentration, can be added thereto; and, after the islets have been separated from the exocrine tissue by continuous density gradient and centrifugation, the solution in the COBE 2991 can be recovered in individual fractions. After separation, the microscopic inspection of the solution is carried out to determine which fractions contain the islets and recover the islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\"> This recovery of the purified islets completes the series of isolation steps. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0010\" num=\"0000\"> II. Protection Solution for Injection into Pancreatic Duct </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\"> The protection solution of the present invention can be used for injection into the pancreatic duct during the isolation of islets for islet transplantation. In addition, the protection solution of the present invention can be very suitably used as the protease-inhibitor-containing protection solution in the isolation method of the present invention described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\"> The protection solution of the present invention can be obtained by adding a protease inhibitor to a tissue protection or preservation solution. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0011\" num=\"0000\"> II-1. Protease Inhibitor </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\"> The protease inhibitor used in the present invention is not particularly limited by its origin and type, as long as it has protease-inhibiting activity. Known protease inhibitors can be suitably used, but a trypsin inhibitor having a trypsin-inhibiting activity is particularly preferred. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\"> Examples of protease inhibitors include at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin (Miraclid\u2122), 4-[2-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl]fluoride (AEBSF, Pefabloc\u2122), gabexate mesilate (FOY\u2122), and nafamostat mesilate (Fusan\u2122). Among these, at least one selected from the group consisting of ulinastatin, gabexate mesilate, and nafamostat mesilate is preferred for use from the standpoint of further improving the islet yield. Ulinastatin and gabexate mesilate are also preferred for their anti-inflammatory activity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\"> The rate of addition of the protease inhibitor to the protection solution can be established as appropriate in accordance with the type of inhibitor and within a range in which the effects of the present invention are achieved. When the protease inhibitor is ulinastatin, the rate of addition is about 10,000 to 100,000 Upper liter and preferably about 50,000 to 100,000 Upper liter. When the protease inhibitor is gabexate mesilate, the rate of addition is about 100 to 10,000 mg per liter and preferably about 500 to 2,000 mg per liter. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0012\" num=\"0000\"> II-2. Tissue Protection or Preservation Solution </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\"> The tissue protection or preservation solution can be selected suitably from known solutions used for the protection or preservation of tissue (including organs and cells). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\"> For example, Euro-Collins solution, University of Wisconsin solution (UW solution), ET-Kyoto solution, Low-Potassium Dextran Glucose solution, HTK solution (Custodiol\u2122), and so forth can be used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\"> Solutions with the compositions given below can also be provided as examples. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\"> Tissue Protection or Preservation Solution (Example 1)  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00001\" num=\"1\"> <patent-tables

II-3. Embodiments of the Protection Solution for Injection into Pancreatic Duct </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\"> The protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct preferably has a low potassium concentration. In specific terms, a potassium concentration of 4 to 50 mM, particularly 10 to 50 mM per 1000 mL protection solution is preferred. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\"> The use of a low potassium concentration avoids the induction of vasospasm and can thereby prevent insulin release from the islets and enable the solution to quickly spread throughout the tissue. This results in an even higher pancreatic duct protection action and improves the yield of transplantable islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\"> The osmolarity of the protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct is preferably 270 to 450 mOsm/L and particularly preferably is 300 to 400 mOsm/L. Swelling or shrinkage of the tissue during protection or preservation can be prevented within this range. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\"> The pH of the protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct is preferably about 7 to 8 in order to stop acidic degradation of the cells and tissue. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\"> The protection solution for injection into the pancreatic duct preferably contains trehalose.

Procedure for Porcine Islets Isolation </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0214\" num=\"0213\"> Porcine islets were isolated using the following procedure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0215\" num=\"0214\"> Porcine pancreatic tissues were obtained at a slaughterhouse in Kyoto. After pancreas procurement, (1) the pancreases were immediately preserved in a container in which two layers had been formed by the two-layer method or (2) a catheter was inserted into each pancreas immediately after procurement and pancreatic duct protection solution was injected through the catheter into the main pancreatic duct of each pancreas and the pancreases were thereafter quickly preserved in a container in which two layers had been formed by the two-layer method, the two layers being PFC and preservation solution. The volume of pancreatic duct protection solution injected in (2) was 1 mL per 1 gram pancreas weight. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0216\" num=\"0215\"> Here, the time from heart beat cessation to immersion of the pancreas in the preservation solution is defined as the warm ischemic time. The time from immersion of the pancreas in the preservation solution to the start of islet separation is defined as the cold ischemic time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0217\" num=\"0216\"> The pancreas preserved by the two-layer method was transported to the islet isolation facility at the University of Kyoto and was then decontaminated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0218\" num=\"0217\"> A cold collagenase solution (Liberase HI\u2122, made by Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then injected into the main duct of the pancreas and the pancreas was distended while the solution was circulated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0219\" num=\"0218\"> The distended pancreas was cut into nine pieces and placed in a Ricordi chamber. The circulation path in this chamber was filled with solution and the system was closed. Then, while circulating the solution with a pump, the temperature of the solution was raised to about 37\u00b0 C. to activate the collagenase and the pancreatic tissue was digested by repeatedly circulating the collagenase solution through the Ricordi chamber. The digestion process was stopped at the point at which just the pancreatic exocrine tissue had been dissociated from around the islets while the cells making up the islets remained intact in their aggregated state. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0220\" num=\"0219\"> To stop digestion, the collagenase was deactivated by lowering the temperature of the solution by opening the circulation path and passing a human-albumin-containing solution at room temperature through the circulation path. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0221\" num=\"0220\"> The pancreatic tissue was recovered after digestion had been halted, by passage of the room temperature solution through the circulation path. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0222\" num=\"0221\"> The time from placement of the pancreas in the Ricordi chamber to the start of recovery of the digested pancreatic tissue was designated as phase 1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0223\" num=\"0222\"> The time from the start of recovery until recovery was complete was designated as phase 2. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0224\" num=\"0223\"> The recovered pancreatic tissue was centrifugally washed with a centrifugal separator and was aggregated and concentrated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0225\" num=\"0224\"> A continuous density gradient was formed in a blood cell washing instrument (COBE 2991 cell processor, Gambro BCT) using a purification solution that contained a density gradient reagent. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0226\" num=\"0225\"> The washed and concentrated pancreatic tissue was then added to the solution in which the density gradient had been formed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0227\" num=\"0226\"> Purification was carried out by isolating the islets from the pancreatic tissue by carrying out centrifugal separation using the continuous density gradient and centrifugation technique to separate the islets from the pancreatic exocrine tissue. After this, the solution in the blood cell washing instrument was collected into individual fractions and a microscopic examination administered to determine which fractions the islets were present in, and the islets were then recovered. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0030\" num=\"0000\"> 3. Evaluation Methods </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0228\" num=\"0227\"> The islet yield and purity were evaluated by dithizone staining. After dithizone staining a 100 \u03bcL sample was taken from the solution suspended in 200 mL and the islet yield was evaluated under a microscope by individual sizes. The purity was given by the proportion of the islets in the total mass inclusive of all elements, e.g., islets, exocrine tissue in addition to the islets, pancreatic duct, and so forth. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0229\" num=\"0228\"> The islet size was obtained as an average of the islets enumerated by individual sizes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0230\" num=\"0229\"> The efficiency of purification was obtained by dividing the number of islets after purification by the number of islets before purification. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0231\" num=\"0230\"> The morphological score (gross morphological evaluation) was qualitatively assessed by having two investigators score the following: shape (flat versus spherical), border (irregular versus well-rounded), integrity (fragmented versus solid/compact), staining quality (uniform versus non-uniform), and diameter (all&lt;100 \u03bcL versus&gt;10%&gt;200 \u03bcL). Each parameter was scored from 0 to 2 with 0 being the lowest score and 2 being the highest score. The lowest total score for islet isolation was therefore 0 and the highest was 10. Spherical, well-rounded, solid or compact, uniformly stained, and large diameter islets were characterized and scored as preferred islets. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0232\" num=\"0231\"> Islet viability was assessed by the simultaneous visualization of live and dead cells using acridine orange (10 \u03bcmol/L) and propidium iodide (15 \u03bcmol/L) (AO/PI). 50 islets were investigated and the viability in each one was visually determined and the mean thereof was calculated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0233\" num=\"0232\"> The stimulation index was calculated from the ratio between insulin secretion at a high glucose concentration to that at a low glucose concentration. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0234\" num=\"0233\"> Islet function was assessed according to the method of Shapiro and Colleagues by monitoring the insulin secretion response of the purified islets to glucose challenge. In brief, 100 Islet Equivalents (IE) were incubated on CMRL solution at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere and then incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere on RPMI1640 solution (GIBCO BRL) containing 2.8 mM ether or 20 mM ether and 20 mM glucose; the supernatant was recovered and the insulin value was measured with an ELISA kit (Morinaga Biochemical Industry Co., Ltd.) using an antigen-antibody reaction. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0235\" num=\"0234\"> The values obtained in the examples and experimental examples were reported using a mean and standard deviation (mean \u00b1SE). Comparisons were made among the three groups using the mean of ANOVA and Fisher&#39;s PLSD post-hoc test. Values with a P value less than 0.05 were taken as significant. </p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0031\">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0032\">Investigation of Pancreatic Duct Protection </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0236\" num=\"0235\"> Comparative experiments were carried out using the procedure described above in order to carry out a comparative investigation of the presence/absence of pancreatic duct protection. The procedures were identical, except that after pancreas procurement, (1) preservation by the two-layer method was immediately carried out (no pancreatic duct protection) or (2) protection solution was injected into the main duct of the pancreas immediately after procurement followed by preservation by the two-layer method (implementation of pancreatic duct protection). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0237\" num=\"0236\"> In these experiments, M-Kyoto solution was used as the pancreatic duct protection solution. M-Kyoto solution and liquid PFC were used in the two-layer method.

The M-UW solution was obtained by adding 100,000 units (U) ulinastatin to 1 L UW solution. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0243\" num=\"0242\"> The experiments were carried out using the following procedure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0244\" num=\"0243\"> Islets were isolated from inbred male Lewis rats weighing from 300 to 380 grams (Chaeles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.). The rat studies were approved by the Review Committee of the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine. The common bile duct was cannulated using a 24-gauge catheter (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) and fixed and the end was then clamped. The pancreas, spleen, and duodenum were removed en bloc and preserved in the particular solution. The pancreas was preserved for 6 hours at 4\u00b0 C. The islets were isolated using the modified method of Sawada (Transplantation. 2003; 75(12): 1965-1969). After preservation, each pancreas was distended using a 2 mg/mL collagenase solution (24 mg Serva collagenase, Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) in 12 mL Hanks&#39; Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). The spleen and duodenum were removed and the pancreas was incubated for 22 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in a 50 mL conical tube without shaking. The digested pancreas was washed three times with UW solution by centrifugal separation (150 g, 3 minutes, 8\u00b0 C.).

Procedure for Human Islet Isolation </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0282\" num=\"0281\"> Human islet isolation was carried out using the same procedure as for porcine islet isolation, except for the points noted below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0283\" num=\"0282\"> With informed consent in place, thirteen human pancreases were acquired from non-heart-beating donors through the Central Japan Region and the Western Japan Region of the Japan Organ Transplant Network. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0284\" num=\"0283\"> A catheter was inserted in order to rapidly cool the pancreases via the blood vessels of the donor&#39;s inguinal region and cold lactated Ringer&#39;s solution was injected through this catheter and circulated from after heart beat cessation until removal of the pancreas. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0285\" num=\"0284\"> The pancreases were then removed and a catheter was immediately inserted and M-Kyoto solution was injected into the main pancreatic duct at the rate of 1 ml per 1 gram pancreas weight. This was quickly followed by immersion of the pancreases in the preservation solution of a two-layer method preservation container. The pancreases were then transported to the GMP-grade Center for Cell and Molecular Therapy at Kyoto University. The two-layer method used M-Kyoto solution and liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0286\" num=\"0285\"> The assessment procedures were the same as in the previously described porcine islet isolation procedure. Statistical evaluation was also the same as for porcine islet isolation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0050\" num=\"0000\"> 6-2. Isolation Protocol </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0287\" num=\"0286\"> Isolation of human islets was carried out by the C2 protocol in 2 of the thirteen cases and was carried out by the Kyoto protocol in 11 of the thirteen cases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0051\" num=\"0000\"> 6-3. Characteristics of Human Donors and Pancreases </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0288\" num=\"0287\"> The mean donor age was 44\u00b14 years. The period of ICU stay was 11\u00b13 days. The BMI was 21\u00b11 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The pancreas size was 87\u00b16 g. Abnormalities were observed in the average blood chemistry values of all the donors. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0289\" num=\"0288\"> The warm ischemic time was 7\u00b13 minutes. The cold ischemic time was 256\u00b118 minutes. The warm ischemic time for all the pancreases was minimized by the immediate circulation with cold lactated Ringer&#39;s solution. In addition, the cold ischemic time was shorter than 6 hours in all cases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0290\" num=\"0289\"> There were no significant differences between the two protocols with regard to donor conditions, warm ischemic time, and cold ischemic time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0052\" num=\"0000\"> 6-4. Assessment of Isolation Protocols </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0291\" num=\"0290\"> The results of the assessment of human islet isolation are shown in Table 11 for the two protocols (C2 protocol, Kyoto protocol).

Transplant Qualifying Criteria </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0299\" num=\"0298\"> The following transplant qualifying criteria were established based on the Edmonton protocol. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0300\" num=\"0299\"> Islet Yield&gt;5,000 IE/kg (patient body weight) </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0301\" num=\"0300\"> Purity&gt;30% </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0302\" num=\"0301\"> Tissue volume&lt;10 mL </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0303\" num=\"0302\"> Viability&gt;70% </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0304\" num=\"0303\"> Endotoxin&lt;5 IE/kg (patient body weight) </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0305\" num=\"0304\"> Negative Gram stain </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0306\" num=\"0305\"> With regard to these criteria, all thirteen cases satisfied the transplant qualifying criteria, with the exception of islet yield. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0054\" num=\"0000\"> 6-6. Islet Transplantation into Type-I Diabetic Patients </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0307\" num=\"0306\"> Of the thirteen cases described above, eleven cases, that is, one case of those islets isolated according to the C2 protocol and ten cases of those islets isolated according to the Kyoto protocol were transplanted into six type-I diabetic patients. The islets isolated in the remaining two cases were cryopreserved. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0308\" num=\"0307\"> Four of the six patients received multiple-donor islet transplants. Two patients received single-donor islet transplants. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0309\" num=\"0308\"> The assessments made after islet transplantation were carried out using the following methods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0310\" num=\"0309\"> The serum blood glucose, insulin requirement, and hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) were assessed daily before and after transplantation. The glucagon stimulation test was carried out before transplantation, on the 30<sup>th </sup>and 60th day after the first transplantation, and on the 30<sup>th </sup>day and 60<sup>th </sup>day after the second transplantation. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was taken for C-peptide measurement immediately before the injection of 1 mg glucagon and 6 minutes after the injection. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0055\" num=\"0000\"> 6-7. Assessment After Islet Transplantation </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0311\" num=\"0310\"> After islet transplantation, none of the six patients suffered from hypoglycemic unawareness and an improved blood glucose control could be observed in all six. In addition, the start of insulin secretion was confirmed in all of the transplant cases based on C-peptide measurement. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0312\" num=\"0311\"> While the mean insulin amount was 39.2\u00b13.2 units at the time of transplantation, it fell to 11.0\u00b14.4 units (P&lt;0.0005). Two patients became insulin free; in two other patients the amount of insulin declined to below 10 units; and in the two other patients the amount of insulin also declined. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0313\" num=\"0312\"> The HbAlC level gradually declined in all six patients, and in all six patients the HbAlc level reached normal at about 3 months after islet transplantation, regardless of whether the transplantation was from a single donor or multiple donors (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0314\" num=\"0313\"> The mean HbAlc level of the six patients underwent substantial improvement, improving from 7.5\u00b10.4% at the time of transplantation to 5.1\u00b10.2% (P&lt;0.0003). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0315\" num=\"0314\"> Prior to transplantation, all the patients had undetectable C-peptide values (&lt;0.1 ng/ml), while post-transplant the C-peptide values could be detected. With regard to the C-peptide values after the first transplantation, the basal value was 0.29\u00b10.06 ng/ml and the post-stimulation value was 0.52\u00b10.11 ng/ml (N=6) (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>). Both the basal C-peptide value and the post-stimulation C-peptide value were substantially improved after the second islet transplantation from the values for the first transplantation. After the second transplantation, the basal C-peptide value was 0.75\u00b10.12 ng/ml (P&lt;0.01) and the post-stimulation value was 1.45\u00b10.26 ng/ml (P&lt;0.005) (N=3) (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0056\" num=\"0000\"> 6-8. Clinical Islet Transplantation </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0316\" num=\"0315\"> Islet transplantation was carried out in a clinical setting in accordance with the Kyoto protocol described above. A second transplantation was carried out in the same manner on the same patient after about 2 months. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0317\" num=\"0316\"> The islet yield for the first transplantation was 354,384 IE and for the second transplantation was 474,234 IE. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0318\" num=\"0317\"> The recipient was a 36-year-old female with a 22-year history of type I diabetes; there had been frequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia and there was a history of diabetic retinopathy. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0319\" num=\"0318\"> Kidney function was normal and creatinine level was 0.7 mg/dl. Immunosuppressives were administered on day 0 and day 4 post-transplantation in accordance with the Edmonton protocol, with the exception that 20 mg basiliximab was used instead of daclizumab. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0320\" num=\"0319\"> To provide a pre-transplantation blood glucose level control, blood glucose was measured before breakfast and before dinner at approximately 2 month intervals for approximately the preceding 2 years. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0321\" num=\"0320\"> Blood glucose prior to islet transplantation was very unstable and ranged broadly from 20 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0322\" num=\"0321\"> After the first transplantation, however, blood glucose was maintained in a narrow range and settled into a narrow range from 50 mg/dL to 150 mg/dL (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0323\" num=\"0322\"> The pre-transplantation insulin requirement was from 30 to 40 unit/day; however, the insulin intake gradually declined to 10 unit/day by 1 month after the first transplantation. Moreover, the patient was able to completely stop and achieve insulin free on day 20 after the second transplantation (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0324\" num=\"0323\"> The transaminase value temporarily increased after the first transplantation, but did not reach or exceed 100 mg/dl and returned to normal values within 3 weeks. The creatinine value remained at or below 1.0 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) stayed at normal values during the entire period of observation. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0325\" num=\"0324\"> As is clear from the results given above, the present invention has been shown to raise efficiency of purification and to raise the yield of islets that satisfy the transplant qualifying criteria. In addition, the present invention has been shown to raise the purification speed and to enable islet isolation with good efficiency in a short period of time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0326\" num=\"0325\"> Moreover, the present invention has been shown to have the ability to acquire good amounts of good-quality islets from non-heart-beating donors. The present invention has also been shown to be highly successful with regard to islet transplantation from human non-heart-beating donors. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The present invention relates to systems and methods for improving the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items.  \\n      It would be desirable to provide systems and methods that provide the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items.  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      It is an object of this invention to provide systems and methods that provide the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items.  \\n      In a system and method according to the invention, a user would be able to purchase or sell futures or options contracts for luxury items using a computer-based futures and options exchange system. The system may preferably list a number of futures or options contracts of a particular luxury item based on user-inputted criteria. Based on this information, the user could either select an existing contract or, alternatively, create a new contract around the desired criteria. The user may then view the contract status and execute a trade.  \\n      Further systems and methods according to the invention, provide a computer based system for electronically collecting market information to aid in the settlement of futures or options contracts. For a particular item for which a futures or options contract is offered, relevant market data from various sources could be captured, compiled, sorted, and updated by the computer system to generate an index for that particular item. This index could then be used to help settle futures and options contracts.  \\n      Alternatively, liquidity and distribution of various illiquid items can be improved through the creation of a centralized data base and system for retrieving closing and current auction prices for determining the value of, and best method for auctioning: goods, services, real assets and securities. The systems and methods according to the invention provide a centralized computer data base(s) for storing relevant data on the auction item or auction object. The centralized data base is connected to various on-line auctions agents. In this way auction data on an item, preferably updated in real-time or at least updated at some pre-determined interval, can be accessible to all who need the information for valuation and determining the best auction method.  \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS  \\n      Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:  \\n       FIG. 1  is an illustration of an electronic implementation of a system Lo sell futures and options contracts for luxury item in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 2  is an illustration, in greater detail, of an electronic implementation of a system to sell futures and options contracts for luxury items in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 3  is an illustration of a typical grading report for a diamond in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 4  is an illustration of a flow chart representing the process of offering a futures contract for one or more diamonds based on one or more standardized profiles in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 5  is an illustration of a flow diagram representing the process of forming a futures contract for a diamond based on the difference between the values of two different profiles in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 6  is an illustration of an interface for selecting wine that may be presented in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;  \\n       FIG. 7  is an illustration of a chart of data for wine futures contracts in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; and  \\n       FIG. 8  is an illustration of a chart of data for wine options contracts in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 9  is an illustration of an interface for searching the data base of auction information based on user inputted criteria in accordance with some of the embodiments of the present invention.  \\n       FIG. 10  is an illustration of an interface for displaying the results of a search of the data base of auction information based on user inputted criteria in accordance with some of the embodiments of the present invention. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n      This invention relates to creating systems and methods for providing futures and options contracts for luxury items\u2014i.e., items that add to pleasure or comfort but are not absolutely necessary to survival of humans or animals. The following embodiment of the invention relates to diamonds. Nevertheless, this embodiment does not limit the invention to this particular subject matter. Rather, it is provided for illustration of the invention and not to limit it to a particular commodity or market.  \\n      Typically, diamonds are classified according to four main characteristics Lo determine the value of a diamond: clarity, color, cut, and carat weight (one carat 0.007 of an ounce).  \\n      Color of a diamond may include blue-white, finest white, fine white, white, commercial white, top silver cape, silver cape, light cape, cape, dark cape, finest light brown, fine light brown, light brown, and dark brown. Commercial color scales may be based on letters of the alphabet with AA being on one end of the spectrum, to D, which covers the previous list from blue-white to silver cape. Most common of color scales is the scale that ranges alphabetically from D to Z which corresponds to a scale of colorless to lightly colored. The value of the diamonds generally decrease as the presence of color increases.  \\n      The cut of a diamond also determines the value of the diamond. Certain cuts, such as brilliant, emerald, pear-shaped and marquise, are the most common. Yet, even among these common cuts, the different geometries of each particular stone affect the value of the diamond. Particularly desirable geometries are well-known in the industry. Highly light-reflective geometries are generally regarded as the most valuable because they provide the most luster, fire and brilliance as seen by a viewer.  \\n      The value of diamonds also depend on the clarity of the diamond\u2014i.e., the presence, or absence, of carbon inclusions in a diamond. For the purposes of this application, clarity of a diamond is defined as In the most commonly-used scale, the clarity ranges are represented as a range from flawless to VVS1 to VS to SI to I. This represents a range from flawless to very slightly included to slightly included to included. Value varies proportionally with the clarity of the diamond\u2014i.e., the more clear the diamond, the more valuable.  \\n      Presently, at least in part because of their scarcity, the market for high quality diamonds is very tightly controlled. One purpose of the systems and methods of the present invention is to provide for greater liquidity in the diamond market.  \\n      Referring to  FIG. 1 , exemplary system  100  for implementing the present invention is shown. As illustrated, system  100  may include one or more workstations  101 . Workstations  101  may be local or remote, and are connected by one or more communications links  102  to computer network  103  that is linked via communications links  105  to server  104 . Server  104  is linked via communications link  110  to back office clearing center  112 .  \\n      In system  100 , server  104  may be any suitable server, processor, computer, or data processing device, or combination of the same. Server  104  may be used to process and settle executed trades of futures and/or options contracts for luxury items.  \\n      Computer network  103  may be any suitable computer network including the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), or any combination of any of the same. Communications links  102  and  105  may be any communications links suitable for communicating data between workstations  101  and server  104 , such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, etc.  \\n      Workstations  101  may be personal computers, laptop computers, mainframe computers, dumb terminals, data displays, Internet browsers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), two-way pagers, wireless terminals, portable telephones, etc., or any combination of the same. Workstations  101  may be used to enter into and proceed with the trades that relate to the present invention, and display trade, benchmark, or spread information to users of system  100 .  \\n      Back office clearing center  112  may be any suitable equipment, such as a computer, a laptop computer, a mainframe computer, etc., or any combination of the same, for causing trades to be cleared and/or verifying that trades are cleared. Communications link  110  may be any communications links suitable for communicating data between server  104  and back office clearing center  112 , such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, etc.  \\n      The server, the back office clearing center, and one of the workstations, which are depicted in  FIG. 1 , are illustrated in more detail in  FIG. 2 . Referring to  FIG. 2 , workstation  101  may include processor  201 , display  202 , input device  203 , and memory  204 , which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory  204  contains a storage device for storing a workstation program for controlling processor  201 . Processor  201  may use the workstation program to present on display  202  trade information relating to bids, offers, executed trades, and luxury item information to a user of workstation  101 . Furthermore, input device  203  may be used by the user to enter such bids and offers, modify them, and to enter into trades involving the futures and/or options contracts for luxury items.  \\n      Server  104  may include processor  211 , display  212 , input device  213 , and memory  214 , which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory  214  contains a storage device for storing trade information relating to the trades. The storage device further contains a server program for controlling processor  211 . Processor  211  uses the server program to transact the purchase and sale of the futures and/or options contracts. Processor  211  may include futures and/or options calculation processor  215  that may be implemented to determine the benchmark values based on market conditions or other criteria that may relate to the items. Processor  211  may include trade processor  216  that executes and processes trades.  \\n      Back office clearing center  112  may include processor  221 , display  222 , input device  223 , and memory  224 , which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory  224  contains a storage device for storing a clearing program for controlling processor  221 . Processor  221  uses the clearing program to clear executed trades. Clearing executed trades may preferably include exchanging currency for a future commitment or a future option.  \\n      A standard diamond profile, according to the invention, based on certain pre-determined characteristics, may be used to standardize the diamond such that the diamond may be bought and sold in a futures and/or options contract market. A standard diamond profile for future delivery may include the following: a brilliant one carat weight, having a VVS2 clarity, and a G color, the proportions of the depth may be between 60% and 62%, the table may be between 60% and 62%, the girdle may be medium to thick without a culet and the polish and symmetry may be graded as good or higher by the Gemological Institute of America, located in Carlsbad, Calif. (the \u201cGIA\u201d). This particular diamond, or a number of such diamonds, may be deliverable at any pre-determined date in the future, but more particularly at one month, two months, three months, four months etc. into the future. A computer based system preferably similar to, or integrated with server  104  will create the standard profile and then post futures or options contracts based on that profile.  \\n       FIG. 3  shows a typical grading report  300  for a diamond. Grading report  300  may typically include shape  310 , color grade  320 , clarity grade  330 , weight  340 , proportions  350  (including depth  352 , table  354 , girdle  356 , and culet  358 ), and finish  360  (including polish  362  and symmetry  364 .) As described above a pre-determined diamond profile can be standardized for future delivery to obtain a base value, or, alternatively, a benchmark, for a diamond futures and/or options contract. Such grading reports are offered, for example, by the GIA and include relevant information for forming a profile of a diamond. A copy of a detailed grading report\u2014e.g., a GIA certificate\u2014may be included with the delivery of the diamond at the termination of the contract.  \\n       FIG. 4  shows a method  400  according to the invention. The method shows standardizing a diamond profile at step  410 . The method also shows offering a futures and/or options contract based on the standard diamond profile at step  420 . Tn an alternative embodiment of the invention, a number of different diamond profiles may be standardized.  \\n       FIG. 5  shows a method  500  of forming a security based on the spread between one particular deliverable\u2014i.e., a diamond at a first diamond profile\u2014and a second particular deliverable\u2014i.e., a diamond at a second diamond profile. The method includes standardizing a first diamond profile  510 , determining a second diamond profile  520 , and forming a futures and/or options contract based on the difference between the value of the standard diamond associated with the first diamond profile and the value of an actual diamond associated with the second diamond profile  530 . In this fashion, the difference in value\u2014i.e., the spread\u2014between the first diamond and the second diamond may be traded as well. With this spread, either the first, standardized or benchmark, diamond value or the second diamond value may be used as the bench mark for this other value or for a plurality of values.  \\n      Standardization of diamond contracts allows future positions to be liquidated easily\u2014e.g., through an exchange or a clearinghouse\u2014rather than by negotiating with the other party to the contract. Thus, a futures and/or options contract preferably adds much-needed liquidity to a particularly illiquid market. This is because the exchange binds each party to perform the contract. Guaranteed performance of each party preferably eliminates the need for costly credit checks on other traders. Thus transaction costs are substantially reduced by requiring only a good faith deposit to insure good credit of the traders.  \\n      Another example of a system and method according to the invention relates to futures and/or options contracts for wine. The scarcity and delicate quality of wine tends to reduce the liquidity of the wine market. According to the invention, however, it is possible to increase the liquidity of the market by standardizing a wine profile to create a benchmark and for trading futures and/or options contracts for the wine based on the standard wine profile.  \\n      Wine can also be classified and selected based on its own unique set of criteria: type, geographic region, winery, vintage, and price range.  \\n      A specific wine or a group of wines may be selected based upon some or all of these five criteria. The wine type can be very broad such as simply red or white. Type can also refer to the specific designation of the wine\u2014e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay or Riesling. Designation of a specific geographic region, winery, vintage and price range can also be used to select a particular wine or group or wines. The specificity with which these criteria are designated will determine the breadth of wine selection\u2014i.e., a person with very specific needs may request a 2001 Nappa Valley Chardonnay whereas another person may simply need a red wine that costs around $10.  \\n       FIG. 6  shows a graphical user interface  600  according to the invention that may be used to select a futures arid/or options contract relating to a future transaction for wine. Interactive screen section  610  shows an area in which the user may select the type of wine. Interactive screen section  620  shows an area in which the user may select a particular geographic location of the vineyard. Interactive screen section  630  shows an area in which the user may select a particular winery that produced the wine. Interactive screen section  640  shows an area in which the user may select a particular vintage, or year of production, of the wine. Finally, interactive screen section  650  shows a price, or range of prices, of the wine.  \\n      Once a user has selected his preferred criteria of wine, area then section  660  preferably shows a single wine or group of wines that fit into the selected user criteria. Once a group of wines appears in area  660 , the user may preferably click on the wine to transfer to futures and/or options screens as shown in  FIGS. 7 and 8 , and described in more detail below. Alternatively once a desired wine is highlighted, the user may click on the \u201cSee futures arid/or options contracts\u201d button  670  to obtain futures and options information. It should be noted that this particular interface may be used for any luxury item as an interface to efficiently obtain a desired contract the he wishes to participate in.  \\n       FIG. 7  shows an example of a futures screen for the trading of wine futures contracts. After selecting a particular futures contract or group of futures contracts, this screen displays relevant market information. The information on the screen may typically include the symbol of the pertinent futures contract  710 , the opening price for the futures contract  720 , the highest and lowest value the futures contract traded at within a specified period  730 , the price of the last futures contract traded  740 , the settlement price  750 \u2014i.e., the current price of the futures contract, the last change in price  760 , and the open interest  770 \u2014i.e.,the total number of futures contracts traded that have not yet been liquidated.  \\n       FIG. 8  shows an example of an options screen for the trading of wine. After selecting a particular option, this screen displays relevant market information. The information on the screen may typically include information on a Calls  810 , which are options to buy futures contracts, as well as Puts  820 , which are options to sell futures contracts. For each of these transactions, the screen will contain relevant market data for each item represented by its particular symbol  801 . The market data may include such information as the amount paid for the last option  802 , the last change in price  803 , the highest price being currently offered to buy the option  804 , the lowest price for which the option is being sold  805 , the volume of shares traded  806 , the open interest  807 \u2014i.e., the total number of options contracts traded that have not yet been liquidated, and the strike price\u2014i.e., the stated price per share for which the future may be purchased (in the case of a call) or sold (in the case of a put) by the option holder upon exercise of the option contract.  \\n      In the case where there is not an existing futures or options contract based on the selected criteria, the user may create a new futures or options contract. This will allow the trading of any available diamond, wine, or luxury item.  \\n      Due to the existing illiquid nature of the markets for luxury items, it may be useful for the methods and systems of the present invention to electronically collect market information to aid in the settlement of luxury item contracts. This information can be organized in the form of a luxury item index\u2014a statistical composite that measures changes in that specific financial market. Tn order to create a luxury item index, the system may electronically capture\u2014e.g., retrieve and preserve in a lasting form\u2014compile\u2014e.g., arrange or compose from materials gathered from several sources\u2014sort\u2014e.g., classify according to a suitable classification system according to class, kind, size, or other suitable criteria\u2014and update relevant data preferably in real time or other suitable pre-determined interval. The result of these systems and methods would be to provide an index for any type of luxury item, group of luxury items, or in fact, any type of less liquid, but exchanged commodity or item. This index could then be used to help settle options or futures contracts or even in certain circumstances, cash contracts as well.  \\n      Examples of this method may include providing an index for diamond prices. This diamond index may be based on available price lists for diamonds\u2014i.e. the Rapaport Sheets\u2014and other similar industry price lists which may be electronically obtainable.  \\n      Advantages of systems and methods according to the invention include allowing a diamond merchant or wine merchant to limit the risk on his future purchase or sale of the respective products. Thus, if diamond retailer A wanted to insure his supply of diamonds for the upcoming holiday season, he may contract to purchase X amount of diamonds in December at a specific price. Though retailer A may pay a premium for the right to buy the diamond in December at a particular price, he is protected from supply problems or other vagaries of the marketplace that may occur between the time when he entered into the contract and the settlement date in December. This is one example of risk-sharing advantages obtained by systems and methods according to the invention.  \\n      Alternatively, systems and methods according to the invention may provide speculators an opportunity to invest in items and markets that, in the past, were not liquid enough to allow for investment by the general public. Systems and methods for creating indexes for these items or markets can help improve their overall liquidity.  \\n      An example of such a market that supports such an index may be housing values. An index may be created for housing values in a particular area\u2014Inputs to such a housing index may be real estate price surveys, mortgage applications, or some other suitable input that may be obtained electronically and used for input into an index processor. In such a system and method according to the invention, the index further may be divided according to regions or may be user-configurable such that the user may create his own index for use according to a user specified region, preferably assuming that the region was sufficiently large to create a usable index. Users could specify a large geographic region\u2014e.g., the Northeast Region of the U.S., or they could specify a particular city\u2014e.g., New York City, or they could specify a particular area within the city\u2014e.g., SOHO or they could specify a particular zip-code or other suitable regional limitation. The system and methods according to the invention would then generate a housing values index for that specified region.  \\n      One use for this system and method according to the invention is to enable the trading of futures and options contracts based on this housing values index. The ability to trade futures and options based on this index would allow banks to reduce their exposure to risk from their mortgage portfolios.  \\n      Another example of a market that supports such an index may be mortgage prepayments\u2014This information may be obtained from banking institutions.  \\n      Another example of a market that supports such an index may be based on privately-held companies Such an index may use the publicly-available EBIDTA (Earnings Before Interest Depreciation and Taxes) as the provider of the data.  \\n      One underlying theme of these systems and methods according to the invention is that an index may be created from any sufficiently liquid points of value.  \\n      Another aspect of the invention involves Internet or intranet auctions. In recent years, on-line auction sites have grown as a place for individuals to buy and sell items. Due to the transient nature of the individualized transactions on these sites, it can be difficult to determine the proper valuation or auction method for a particular auction item without painstakingly reviewing the transaction history of many other similar auction items. For example, changes in the number of similar items being auctioned at a given site at a given time may drastically affect the final price or, with respect to used items, small differences in condition may drastically affect the price paid for the auction item. The auction method used, such as the choice of auction type, e.g., standard auction, reserve price auction, private auction, Dutch auction, or auction length or opening bid, may also affect the price paid for the auction item. The particular Internet auction site used might also affect the final price paid for an auction item. By tracking auctions of particular items over a longer period of time and over many different auction sites, buyers and sellers can make better decisions with regard to pricing as well as the best method for conducting the auction.  \\n      In this embodiment of the invention, liquidity and distribution of auction items can be improved through systems and methods that track transactions of Internet auction sites. By tracking Internet auctions sites for pending and completed auctions the systems and methods of this invention can provide information which is useful for determining valuation or best auction method for a particular auction item. The tracking of Internet auction sites can be performed by, searching the Internet auction sites, capturing, compiling, extracting a possibly user-specified portion of the data, performing possibly user-specified calculations with this extracted data, and updating the data and the results.  \\n      Furthermore, these systems and methods of the invention relate to a data processing methodology and system for a universal, uniform system for tracking auction data by searching, capturing, compiling, extracting, calculating, and updating. These systems and methods could be used for auction items such as: diamonds, wine, motor vehicles, boats, antiques, artwork, real property, and securities or any suitable auctioned items. More precisely, it relates to a computerized system containing a server similar to  104  by which all current systems are converted in a uniform manner to a unique but universal system, by creating and then centralizing, that single system as the single source of the system so that data may be searched, captured, compiled, sorted, extracted, arranged in such a manner to allow calculations to performed on the data, calculated and updated from a variety of sources and accurate, from which up-to-date values may be established preferably in real-time, though it may also be establish at any suitable pre-determined interval. This system may be preferably accessed through a plurality of workstations similar to workstation  101 . Through these workstations, a user may access the server to view the tracked auction data and may also configure the searching, capturing, compiling, sorting, extracting, calculating, and updating the data.  \\n      Records for Internet auctioned items are currently maintained by various unrelated parties because auctions generally occur at disparate locations on the Internet. Therefore, Internet auctioned items are not conducive to price transparency. Furthermore, there is no current universal system or means for searching and then universally centralizing all records to ensure that all information is up to date, accurate and accessible to various unrelated parties.  \\n      Through systems and methods according to the invention, users will be able to view auction statistics and other relevant information calculated from auction data. Preferably, by specifying criteria for a particular item or items and specifying the type of information desired, a user will be presented with relevant statistical data which will be helpful for participating in an Internet auction. The statistical data for each auction in progress and completed auction, may preferably contain information relevant to the successful bids, the unsuccessful bids, the final price, the method of auction, as well as validation of the auction data.  \\n       FIG. 9  shows a graphical user interface  900  according to the invention that may be used to perform a search of auction data based upon user criteria. In this case, the user has already selected PDAs as the category  910  for the search. For each category of items selected, the search interface  900  contains search options to define the scope of the search. The number and specific type of options available will depend on the category selected. For PDAs, there are seven search options. Interactive screen section  920  shows an area in which a user may select the brand. Interactive screen section  930  shows an area in which a user may select the model. Interactive screen section  940  shows an area in which a user may select the screen type. Interactive screen section  950  shows an area in which a user may select the amount of memory. Interactive screen section  960  shows an area in which a user may select the internet connectivity. Interactive screen section  970  shows an area in which a user may select the condition of the PDA being auctioned\u2014i.e., new or used. Further gradations (e.g.\u2014condition  1 - 10 ) may also be used. Interactive screen section  980  shows an area in which a user may select the time frame to be searched\u2014i.e., currently pending auctions only or all auctions that occurred over a specified period. After the user specifies the criteria desired for the search, the user may select the Search button  990  to perform the search.  \\n       FIG. 10  shows a graphical user interface  1000  according to the invention that may be used to display the results of the auction data search. Screen section  1010  shows the category searched. Screen section  1020  shows the search criteria selected by the user. Interactive screen section  1030  shows selected statistics calculated from the search. One or more statistics, such as average price, high price, low price, auction duration, units sold, and unit available, may be selected and the user may click on \u201cView Expanded Statistics\u201d  1050  to display more detailed information, which may include charts or graphs, for each statistical item. Interactive screen section  1040  preferably shows the auctions that match the users selected criteria. The screen section may differentiate between the pending and completed auctions. The user may select one or more auctions and click \u201cView Auction Information\u201d  1060 , to view the specific information about the auction(s) selected including verification data. The user may also select one or more auctions and click \u201cRemove From Stats\u201d  1070 , to remove auction(s) from being calculated in the statistics.  \\n      Accordingly, systems and methods for providing liquidity and distribution networks for luxury and other items are provided. It will be understood that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of the invention and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, with is limited only by the claims that follow.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The present invention relates to systems and methods for improving the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\"> It would be desirable to provide systems and methods that provide the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items. </p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\"> It is an object of this invention to provide systems and methods that provide the liquidity and distribution network for luxury items. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\"> In a system and method according to the invention, a user would be able to purchase or sell futures or options contracts for luxury items using a computer-based futures and options exchange system. The system may preferably list a number of futures or options contracts of a particular luxury item based on user-inputted criteria. Based on this information, the user could either select an existing contract or, alternatively, create a new contract around the desired criteria. The user may then view the contract status and execute a trade. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\"> Further systems and methods according to the invention, provide a computer based system for electronically collecting market information to aid in the settlement of futures or options contracts.

This index could then be used to help settle futures and options contracts. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\"> Alternatively, liquidity and distribution of various illiquid items can be improved through the creation of a centralized data base and system for retrieving closing and current auction prices for determining the value of, and best method for auctioning: goods, services, real assets and securities. The systems and methods according to the invention provide a centralized computer data base(s) for storing relevant data on the auction item or auction object. The centralized data base is connected to various on-line auctions agents. In this way auction data on an item, preferably updated in real-time or at least updated at some pre-determined interval, can be accessible to all who need the information for valuation and determining the best auction method. </p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\"> Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which: </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an electronic implementation of a system Lo sell futures and options contracts for luxury item in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is an illustration, in greater detail, of an electronic implementation of a system to sell futures and options contracts for luxury items in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of a typical grading report for a diamond in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of a flow chart representing the process of offering a futures contract for one or more diamonds based on one or more standardized profiles in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration of a flow diagram representing the process of forming a futures contract for a diamond based on the difference between the values of two different profiles in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of an interface for selecting wine that may be presented in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustration of a chart of data for wine futures contracts in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention; and </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> is an illustration of a chart of data for wine options contracts in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> is an illustration of an interface for searching the data base of auction information based on user inputted criteria in accordance with some of the embodiments of the present invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> is an illustration of an interface for displaying the results of a search of the data base of auction information based on user inputted criteria in accordance with some of the embodiments of the present invention.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\"> This invention relates to creating systems and methods for providing futures and options contracts for luxury items\u2014i.e., items that add to pleasure or comfort but are not absolutely necessary to survival of humans or animals. The following embodiment of the invention relates to diamonds. Nevertheless, this embodiment does not limit the invention to this particular subject matter. Rather, it is provided for illustration of the invention and not to limit it to a particular commodity or market. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\"> Typically, diamonds are classified according to four main characteristics Lo determine the value of a diamond: clarity, color, cut, and carat weight (one carat 0.007 of an ounce). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\"> Color of a diamond may include blue-white, finest white, fine white, white, commercial white, top silver cape, silver cape, light cape, cape, dark cape, finest light brown, fine light brown, light brown, and dark brown. Commercial color scales may be based on letters of the alphabet with AA being on one end of the spectrum, to D, which covers the previous list from blue-white to silver cape. Most common of color scales is the scale that ranges alphabetically from D to Z which corresponds to a scale of colorless to lightly colored. The value of the diamonds generally decrease as the presence of color increases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\"> The cut of a diamond also determines the value of the diamond. Certain cuts, such as brilliant, emerald, pear-shaped and marquise, are the most common. Yet, even among these common cuts, the different geometries of each particular stone affect the value of the diamond. Particularly desirable geometries are well-known in the industry. Highly light-reflective geometries are generally regarded as the most valuable because they provide the most luster, fire and brilliance as seen by a viewer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\"> The value of diamonds also depend on the clarity of the diamond\u2014i.e., the presence, or absence, of carbon inclusions in a diamond. For the purposes of this application, clarity of a diamond is defined as In the most commonly-used scale, the clarity ranges are represented as a range from flawless to VVS1 to VS to SI to I. This represents a range from flawless to very slightly included to slightly included to included. Value varies proportionally with the clarity of the diamond\u2014i.e., the more clear the diamond, the more valuable. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\"> Presently, at least in part because of their scarcity, the market for high quality diamonds is very tightly controlled. One purpose of the systems and methods of the present invention is to provide for greater liquidity in the diamond market. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\"> Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, exemplary system <b>100</b> for implementing the present invention is shown.

Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, workstation <b>101</b> may include processor <b>201</b>, display <b>202</b>, input device <b>203</b>, and memory <b>204</b>, which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory <b>204</b> contains a storage device for storing a workstation program for controlling processor <b>201</b>. Processor <b>201</b> may use the workstation program to present on display <b>202</b> trade information relating to bids, offers, executed trades, and luxury item information to a user of workstation <b>101</b>. Furthermore, input device <b>203</b> may be used by the user to enter such bids and offers, modify them, and to enter into trades involving the futures and/or options contracts for luxury items. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\"> Server <b>104</b> may include processor <b>211</b>, display <b>212</b>, input device <b>213</b>, and memory <b>214</b>, which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory <b>214</b> contains a storage device for storing trade information relating to the trades. The storage device further contains a server program for controlling processor <b>211</b>.

Processor <b>211</b> may include trade processor <b>216</b> that executes and processes trades. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\"> Back office clearing center <b>112</b> may include processor <b>221</b>, display <b>222</b>, input device <b>223</b>, and memory <b>224</b>, which may be interconnected. In a preferred embodiment, memory <b>224</b> contains a storage device for storing a clearing program for controlling processor <b>221</b>. Processor <b>221</b> uses the clearing program to clear executed trades. Clearing executed trades may preferably include exchanging currency for a future commitment or a future option. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\"> A standard diamond profile, according to the invention, based on certain pre-determined characteristics, may be used to standardize the diamond such that the diamond may be bought and sold in a futures and/or options contract market. A standard diamond profile for future delivery may include the following: a brilliant one carat weight, having a VVS2 clarity, and a G color, the proportions of the depth may be between 60% and 62%, the table may be between 60% and 62%, the girdle may be medium to thick without a culet and the polish and symmetry may be graded as good or higher by the Gemological Institute of America, located in Carlsbad, Calif. (the \u201cGIA\u201d). This particular diamond, or a number of such diamonds, may be deliverable at any pre-determined date in the future, but more particularly at one month, two months, three months, four months etc. into the future. A computer based system preferably similar to, or integrated with server <b>104</b> will create the standard profile and then post futures or options contracts based on that profile. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> shows a typical grading report <b>300</b> for a diamond. Grading report <b>300</b> may typically include shape <b>310</b>, color grade <b>320</b>, clarity grade <b>330</b>, weight <b>340</b>, proportions <b>350</b> (including depth <b>352</b>, table <b>354</b>, girdle <b>356</b>, and culet <b>358</b>), and finish <b>360</b> (including polish <b>362</b> and symmetry <b>364</b>.) As described above a pre-determined diamond profile can be standardized for future delivery to obtain a base value, or, alternatively, a benchmark, for a diamond futures and/or options contract. Such grading reports are offered, for example, by the GIA and include relevant information for forming a profile of a diamond. A copy of a detailed grading report\u2014e.g., a GIA certificate\u2014may be included with the delivery of the diamond at the termination of the contract. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method <b>400</b> according to the invention. The method shows standardizing a diamond profile at step <b>410</b>. The method also shows offering a futures and/or options contract based on the standard diamond profile at step <b>420</b>. Tn an alternative embodiment of the invention, a number of different diamond profiles may be standardized. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows a method <b>500</b> of forming a security based on the spread between one particular deliverable\u2014i.e., a diamond at a first diamond profile\u2014and a second particular deliverable\u2014i.e., a diamond at a second diamond profile. The method includes standardizing a first diamond profile <b>510</b>, determining a second diamond profile <b>520</b>, and forming a futures and/or options contract based on the difference between the value of the standard diamond associated with the first diamond profile and the value of an actual diamond associated with the second diamond profile <b>530</b>. In this fashion, the difference in value\u2014i.e., the spread\u2014between the first diamond and the second diamond may be traded as well. With this spread, either the first, standardized or benchmark, diamond value or the second diamond value may be used as the bench mark for this other value or for a plurality of values. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\"> Standardization of diamond contracts allows future positions to be liquidated easily\u2014e.g., through an exchange or a clearinghouse\u2014rather than by negotiating with the other party to the contract. Thus, a futures and/or options contract preferably adds much-needed liquidity to a particularly illiquid market. This is because the exchange binds each party to perform the contract. Guaranteed performance of each party preferably eliminates the need for costly credit checks on other traders. Thus transaction costs are substantially reduced by requiring only a good faith deposit to insure good credit of the traders. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\"> Another example of a system and method according to the invention relates to futures and/or options contracts for wine. The scarcity and delicate quality of wine tends to reduce the liquidity of the wine market. According to the invention, however, it is possible to increase the liquidity of the market by standardizing a wine profile to create a benchmark and for trading futures and/or options contracts for the wine based on the standard wine profile. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\"> Wine can also be classified and selected based on its own unique set of criteria: type, geographic region, winery, vintage, and price range. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\"> A specific wine or a group of wines may be selected based upon some or all of these five criteria. The wine type can be very broad such as simply red or white. Type can also refer to the specific designation of the wine\u2014e.g., Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay or Riesling. Designation of a specific geographic region, winery, vintage and price range can also be used to select a particular wine or group or wines. The specificity with which these criteria are designated will determine the breadth of wine selection\u2014i.e., a person with very specific needs may request a 2001 Nappa Valley Chardonnay whereas another person may simply need a red wine that costs around $10. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows a graphical user interface <b>600</b> according to the invention that may be used to select a futures arid/or options contract relating to a future transaction for wine. Interactive screen section <b>610</b> shows an area in which the user may select the type of wine. Interactive screen section <b>620</b> shows an area in which the user may select a particular geographic location of the vineyard. Interactive screen section <b>630</b> shows an area in which the user may select a particular winery that produced the wine. Interactive screen section <b>640</b> shows an area in which the user may select a particular vintage, or year of production, of the wine. Finally, interactive screen section <b>650</b> shows a price, or range of prices, of the wine. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\"> Once a user has selected his preferred criteria of wine, area then section <b>660</b> preferably shows a single wine or group of wines that fit into the selected user criteria. Once a group of wines appears in area <b>660</b>, the user may preferably click on the wine to transfer to futures and/or options screens as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, and described in more detail below. Alternatively once a desired wine is highlighted, the user may click on the \u201cSee futures arid/or options contracts\u201d button <b>670</b> to obtain futures and options information. It should be noted that this particular interface may be used for any luxury item as an interface to efficiently obtain a desired contract the he wishes to participate in. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a futures screen for the trading of wine futures contracts. After selecting a particular futures contract or group of futures contracts, this screen displays relevant market information. The information on the screen may typically include the symbol of the pertinent futures contract <b>710</b>, the opening price for the futures contract <b>720</b>, the highest and lowest value the futures contract traded at within a specified period <b>730</b>, the price of the last futures contract traded <b>740</b>, the settlement price <b>750</b>\u2014i.e., the current price of the futures contract, the last change in price <b>760</b>, and the open interest <b>770</b>\u2014i.e.,the total number of futures contracts traded that have not yet been liquidated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of an options screen for the trading of wine. After selecting a particular option, this screen displays relevant market information. The information on the screen may typically include information on a Calls <b>810</b>, which are options to buy futures contracts, as well as Puts <b>820</b>, which are options to sell futures contracts. For each of these transactions, the screen will contain relevant market data for each item represented by its particular symbol <b>801</b>. The market data may include such information as the amount paid for the last option <b>802</b>, the last change in price <b>803</b>, the highest price being currently offered to buy the option <b>804</b>, the lowest price for which the option is being sold <b>805</b>, the volume of shares traded <b>806</b>, the open interest <b>807</b>\u2014i.e., the total number of options contracts traded that have not yet been liquidated, and the strike price\u2014i.e., the stated price per share for which the future may be purchased (in the case of a call) or sold (in the case of a put) by the option holder upon exercise of the option contract. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\"> In the case where there is not an existing futures or options contract based on the selected criteria, the user may create a new futures or options contract. This will allow the trading of any available diamond, wine, or luxury item. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\"> Due to the existing illiquid nature of the markets for luxury items, it may be useful for the methods and systems of the present invention to electronically collect market information to aid in the settlement of luxury item contracts. This information can be organized in the form of a luxury item index\u2014a statistical composite that measures changes in that specific financial market. Tn order to create a luxury item index, the system may electronically capture\u2014e.g., retrieve and preserve in a lasting form\u2014compile\u2014e.g., arrange or compose from materials gathered from several sources\u2014sort\u2014e.g., classify according to a suitable classification system according to class, kind, size, or other suitable criteria\u2014and update relevant data preferably in real time or other suitable pre-determined interval. The result of these systems and methods would be to provide an index for any type of luxury item, group of luxury items, or in fact, any type of less liquid, but exchanged commodity or item. This index could then be used to help settle options or futures contracts or even in certain circumstances, cash contracts as well. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\"> Examples of this method may include providing an index for diamond prices. This diamond index may be based on available price lists for diamonds\u2014i.e. the Rapaport Sheets\u2014and other similar industry price lists which may be electronically obtainable. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\"> Advantages of systems and methods according to the invention include allowing a diamond merchant or wine merchant to limit the risk on his future purchase or sale of the respective products. Thus, if diamond retailer A wanted to insure his supply of diamonds for the upcoming holiday season, he may contract to purchase X amount of diamonds in December at a specific price. Though retailer A may pay a premium for the right to buy the diamond in December at a particular price, he is protected from supply problems or other vagaries of the marketplace that may occur between the time when he entered into the contract and the settlement date in December. This is one example of risk-sharing advantages obtained by systems and methods according to the invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\"> Alternatively, systems and methods according to the invention may provide speculators an opportunity to invest in items and markets that, in the past, were not liquid enough to allow for investment by the general public. Systems and methods for creating indexes for these items or markets can help improve their overall liquidity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\"> An example of such a market that supports such an index may be housing values. An index may be created for housing values in a particular area\u2014Inputs to such a housing index may be real estate price surveys, mortgage applications, or some other suitable input that may be obtained electronically and used for input into an index processor. In such a system and method according to the invention, the index further may be divided according to regions or may be user-configurable such that the user may create his own index for use according to a user specified region, preferably assuming that the region was sufficiently large to create a usable index. Users could specify a large geographic region\u2014e.g., the Northeast Region of the U.S., or they could specify a particular city\u2014e.g., New York City, or they could specify a particular area within the city\u2014e.g., SOHO or they could specify a particular zip-code or other suitable regional limitation. The system and methods according to the invention would then generate a housing values index for that specified region. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\"> One use for this system and method according to the invention is to enable the trading of futures and options contracts based on this housing values index. The ability to trade futures and options based on this index would allow banks to reduce their exposure to risk from their mortgage portfolios. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\"> Another example of a market that supports such an index may be mortgage prepayments\u2014This information may be obtained from banking institutions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\"> Another example of a market that supports such an index may be based on privately-held companies Such an index may use the publicly-available EBIDTA (Earnings Before Interest Depreciation and Taxes) as the provider of the data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\"> One underlying theme of these systems and methods according to the invention is that an index may be created from any sufficiently liquid points of value. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\"> Another aspect of the invention involves Internet or intranet auctions. In recent years, on-line auction sites have grown as a place for individuals to buy and sell items. Due to the transient nature of the individualized transactions on these sites, it can be difficult to determine the proper valuation or auction method for a particular auction item without painstakingly reviewing the transaction history of many other similar auction items. For example, changes in the number of similar items being auctioned at a given site at a given time may drastically affect the final price or, with respect to used items, small differences in condition may drastically affect the price paid for the auction item. The auction method used, such as the choice of auction type, e.g., standard auction, reserve price auction, private auction, Dutch auction, or auction length or opening bid, may also affect the price paid for the auction item. The particular Internet auction site used might also affect the final price paid for an auction item. By tracking auctions of particular items over a longer period of time and over many different auction sites, buyers and sellers can make better decisions with regard to pricing as well as the best method for conducting the auction. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\"> In this embodiment of the invention, liquidity and distribution of auction items can be improved through systems and methods that track transactions of Internet auction sites. By tracking Internet auctions sites for pending and completed auctions the systems and methods of this invention can provide information which is useful for determining valuation or best auction method for a particular auction item. The tracking of Internet auction sites can be performed by, searching the Internet auction sites, capturing, compiling, extracting a possibly user-specified portion of the data, performing possibly user-specified calculations with this extracted data, and updating the data and the results. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\"> Furthermore, these systems and methods of the invention relate to a data processing methodology and system for a universal, uniform system for tracking auction data by searching, capturing, compiling, extracting, calculating, and updating. These systems and methods could be used for auction items such as: diamonds, wine, motor vehicles, boats, antiques, artwork, real property, and securities or any suitable auctioned items. More precisely, it relates to a computerized system containing a server similar to <b>104</b> by which all current systems are converted in a uniform manner to a unique but universal system, by creating and then centralizing, that single system as the single source of the system so that data may be searched, captured, compiled, sorted, extracted, arranged in such a manner to allow calculations to performed on the data, calculated and updated from a variety of sources and accurate, from which up-to-date values may be established preferably in real-time, though it may also be establish at any suitable pre-determined interval. This system may be preferably accessed through a plurality of workstations similar to workstation <b>101</b>. Through these workstations, a user may access the server to view the tracked auction data and may also configure the searching, capturing, compiling, sorting, extracting, calculating, and updating the data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\"> Records for Internet auctioned items are currently maintained by various unrelated parties because auctions generally occur at disparate locations on the Internet. Therefore, Internet auctioned items are not conducive to price transparency. Furthermore, there is no current universal system or means for searching and then universally centralizing all records to ensure that all information is up to date, accurate and accessible to various unrelated parties. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\"> Through systems and methods according to the invention, users will be able to view auction statistics and other relevant information calculated from auction data. Preferably, by specifying criteria for a particular item or items and specifying the type of information desired, a user will be presented with relevant statistical data which will be helpful for participating in an Internet auction. The statistical data for each auction in progress and completed auction, may preferably contain information relevant to the successful bids, the unsuccessful bids, the final price, the method of auction, as well as validation of the auction data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> shows a graphical user interface <b>900</b> according to the invention that may be used to perform a search of auction data based upon user criteria. In this case, the user has already selected PDAs as the category <b>910</b> for the search. For each category of items selected, the search interface <b>900</b> contains search options to define the scope of the search. The number and specific type of options available will depend on the category selected. For PDAs, there are seven search options. Interactive screen section <b>920</b> shows an area in which a user may select the brand. Interactive screen section <b>930</b> shows an area in which a user may select the model. Interactive screen section <b>940</b> shows an area in which a user may select the screen type. Interactive screen section <b>950</b> shows an area in which a user may select the amount of memory. Interactive screen section <b>960</b> shows an area in which a user may select the internet connectivity. Interactive screen section <b>970</b> shows an area in which a user may select the condition of the PDA being auctioned\u2014i.e., new or used. Further gradations (e.g.\u2014condition <b>1</b>-<b>10</b>) may also be used. Interactive screen section <b>980</b> shows an area in which a user may select the time frame to be searched\u2014i.e., currently pending auctions only or all auctions that occurred over a specified period. After the user specifies the criteria desired for the search, the user may select the Search button <b>990</b> to perform the search. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> shows a graphical user interface <b>1000</b> according to the invention that may be used to display the results of the auction data search. Screen section <b>1010</b> shows the category searched. Screen section <b>1020</b> shows the search criteria selected by the user. Interactive screen section <b>1030</b> shows selected statistics calculated from the search. One or more statistics, such as average price, high price, low price, auction duration, units sold, and unit available, may be selected and the user may click on \u201cView Expanded Statistics\u201d <b>1050</b> to display more detailed information, which may include charts or graphs, for each statistical item. Interactive screen section <b>1040</b> preferably shows the auctions that match the users selected criteria. The screen section may differentiate between the pending and completed auctions. The user may select one or more auctions and click \u201cView Auction Information\u201d <b>1060</b>, to view the specific information about the auction(s) selected including verification data. The user may also select one or more auctions and click \u201cRemove From Stats\u201d <b>1070</b>, to remove auction(s) from being calculated in the statistics. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\"> Accordingly, systems and methods for providing liquidity and distribution networks for luxury and other items are provided. It will be understood that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of the invention and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention, with is limited only by the claims that follow. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Field of the Invention  \\n      The present invention is in the fields of molecular biology and protein chemistry. The invention is related generally to methods of synthesizing or amplifying (copying) nucleic acids using one or more Translesion DNA polymerases. In some aspects, the methods are directed to introducing a random mutation into a nucleic acid and/or to introducing a random mutation into an encoded polypeptide. In other aspects, the methods are directed to introducing a modified nucleotide into a nucleic acid. In further aspects, the methods comprise use of at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and, optionally, at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase. The methods also comprise use of at least two Translesion DNA polymerases and optionally, at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase. The invention also relates to mutagenized and/or modified nucleic acid molecules produced by these methods, and to fragments or derivatives thereof. The invention also relates to vectors and host cells comprising such mutagenized and/or modified nucleic acid molecules, fragments, or derivatives. The invention also relates to the use of mutagenized and/or modified nucleic acid molecules to produce desired polypeptides or proteins and to use of the modified nucleic acid molecules to analyze sample nucleic acids, to detect one or more nucleic acid molecules in a sample and/or to determine the amount (exactly or approximately) of one or more nucleic acid molecules in a sample. The invention also relates to kits or compositions or compounds for use in the invention or for carrying out the invention.  \\n      2. Related Art  \\n      DNA Amplification  \\n      In order to increase the copy number of, or \u201camplify,\u201d specific sequences of DNA in a sample, investigators have relied on a number of amplification techniques. A commonly used amplification technique is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) method described by Mullis and colleagues (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,800,159). This method uses \u201cprimer\u201d sequences which are complementary to opposing regions on the DNA sequence to be amplified. These primers are added to the DNA target sample, along with a molar excess of nucleotide bases and a DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase), and the primers bind to their target via base-specific binding interactions (i.e., adenine binds to thymine, cytosine to guanine).  \\n      If the target polynucleotide contains two strands, it may be necessary to separate the strands of the nucleic acid before it can be used as the template, either as a separate step or simultaneously with the synthesis of the primer extension products. This strand separation can be accomplished by any suitable denaturing method including physical, chemical or enzymatic means. One physical method of separating the strands of the polynucleotide involves heating the polynucleotide until it is substantially denatured. Strand separation may also be induced by an enzyme from the class of enzymes known as helicases or the enzyme RecA, which has helicase activity and in the presence of rATP is known to denature DNA. The reaction conditions suitable for separating the strands of polynucleotides with helicases are described by Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology, Vol. XLIII \u201cDNA: Replication and Recombination\u201d (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1978), B. Kuhn et al., \u201cDNA Helicases\u201d, pp. 63-67, and techniques for using RecA are reviewed in C. Radding, Ann. Rev. Genetics, 16:405-37 (1982). Strand separation may also be performed by applying a voltage (U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,508).  \\n      Other techniques for amplification of target nucleic acid sequences have also been developed. For example, Walker et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166; EP 0 684 315) described a method called Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), which differs from PCR in that it operates at a single temperature and uses a polymerase/endonuclease combination of enzymes to generate single-stranded fragments of the target DNA sequence, which then serve as templates for the production of complementary DNA (cDNA) strands. An alternative amplification procedure, termed Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA) was disclosed by Davey et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,818; EP 0 329 822). Similar to SDA, NASBA employs an isothermal reaction, but is based on the use of RNA primers for amplification rather than DNA primers as in PCR or SDA. Another known amplification procedure includes Promoter Ligation Activated Transcriptase (LAT) described by Berninger et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,370). Single primer amplification provides for the amplification of a template that possesses a stem-loop or inverted repeat structure where the template is flanked by relatively short complementary sequences. U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,584 discloses a method wherein single stranded DNA can be generated by the polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotide primers, one present in a limiting concentration. U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,728 discloses an improved method for performing a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a targeted piece of DNA, wherein by controlling the annealing times and concentration of both the outer and the inner set of primers according to the method disclosed, highly specific and efficient amplification of a targeted piece of DNA can be achieved without depletion or removal of the outer primers from the reaction mixture vessel. U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,632 discloses recombination PCR (RPCR) wherein PCR is used with at least two primer species to add double-stranded homologous ends to DNA such that the homologous ends undergo in vivo recombination following transfection of host cells.  \\n      Horton et al. (1989) Gene 77:61, discloses a method for making chimeric genes using PCR to generate overlapping homologous regions. Silver and Keerikatte (1989)  J. Virol.  63:1924 describe another variation of the standard PCR approach (which requires oligonucleotide primers complementary to both ends of the segment to be amplified) to allow amplification of DNA flanked on only one side by a region of known DNA sequence. Triglia et al. (1988)  Nucl. Acids Res.  16:8186, describe an approach which requires the inversion of the sequence of interest by circularization and re-opening at a site distinct from the one of interest, and is called \u201cinverted PCR.\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,905 discloses end-complementary amplification.  \\n      Random Mutagenesis  \\n      Random mutagenesis is used to introduce random changes into polynucleotides and encoded proteins (Miller et al., (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics, CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Greener et al., (1994) Strategies in  Mol Biol  7:32-34) and is used in directed evolution strategies. Random mutagenesis and other directed evolution strategies have advantages over rational design methods by, for example, allowing one to change or optimize a biological molecule in contexts not found in nature. Random mutagenesis is also used in structure-function studies and has the advantage over reverse genetic techniques of allowing one to carry out structure-function studies without making assumptions regarding which regions of a molecule may be essential or dispensable to a particular activity. Further, random mutagenesis can potentially greatly reduce the time and effort needed to generate a large number of progeny for either directed evolution or structure-function studies over current techniques.  \\n      More recent methods of random mutagenesis rely on error-prone DNA polymerases. Using these polymerases, randomized (mutagenized) DNA is produced and cloned into expression vectors, and the resulting mutant libraries are screened for activity such as enzymatic or binding activity. The level of desired mutation frequency varies with the application. For example, to analyze protein structure-function relationships, one amino acid change per gene is desired (1-2 base changes per 1000 nucleotides). In directed evolution strategies, mutation frequencies of 1-4 amino acid changes per gene (2-7 nucleotide changes) are desired (Wan, L., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  9.5:12825-12831 (1998); Cherry, J. R., et al.,  Nature Biotechnology  17:379-384 (1999)). Some strategies involve highly mutagenized libraries containing 20 point mutations per gene (Daugherty, P. S., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  97:2029-2034 (2000)).  \\n      Up to the present, DNA polymerases were not available with mutation frequencies high enough to generate the required number of mutations per gene during a single round of copying a gene. Protocols were developed to force misincorporation by the use of nucleotide concentration imbalance during a single round of DNA synthesis (Liao, X. and Wise J. A.,  Gene  88:107-111 (1990)), but the rate of mutation and distribution of mutation type were difficult to control. To address the issues of introducing a sufficiently high number of mutations in a gene while maintaining some control over the number of mutations actually introduced, PCR random mutagenesis with pol Taq was developed (Leung, D. W., et al.,  Technique  1:11-15 (1989); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F.,  PCR Methods Applications  2:28-33 (1992); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in  PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual , C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  PCR Methods Applications  1:17-24 (1991); Zhou, Y., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  19:6052 (1991); Vartanian, J. P., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  14:2627-2631 (1996); Fromant, M., et al.,  Anal. Biochem.  224:347-353 (1995); Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Biochem.  27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  18:3739-3744 (1990); Huang, M. M., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  20:4567-4573 (1992)).  \\n      The formula f=ne/2 describes the average mutation frequency (f) for PCR amplification as a function of the polymerase error rate per nucleotide per cycle (e) and the number of cycles (n), assuming e is constant at each cycle and the polymerase makes one pass of each DNA molecule per cycle (p=pass number) (Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  PCR Methods Applications  1:17-24 (1991)). The frequency of DNA mutations can be controlled by altering the number of cycles (n) and/or the polymerase error rate per nucleotide incorporated (e). It is a given that the number of PCR cycles (n) is greater than or equal to the number passes (p) per cycle, n\u2267p. As the starting DNA amount is increased, the inequality between n and p increases. That is as the amount of starting DNA increases, the number of DNA molecules in a population that do not get copied during one PCR cycle also increases. So a third variable, starting DNA amount, can be used to influence p and thus the frequency of DNA mutations.  \\n      Pol Taq has an average error rate (e) of 1\u00d710 \u22124  (Table 1; Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Biochem.  27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  18:3739-3744(1990)) so that after n=20 cycles with a single pass per cycle (p=1) there would be on the average one base change in 1000 nucleotides incorporated. But the average error rate of pol Taq does not reflect its misincorporation bias, a strong tendency to misincorporate G whenever a template T is encountered (Table 1 and 3, Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Biochem.  27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  18:3739-3744 (1990)). A library of mutants generated with pol Taq using standard PCR reaction conditions will contain predominantly transition mutations and particularly T\u2192C (Zhou, Y., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  19:6052 (1991)). In addition, many applications require a higher mutation frequency (2-20 base changes per 1000 nucleotides).  \\n      To overcome these limitations, protocols were developed that increase the error rate of pol Taq and decrease its misincorporation bias (Leung, D. W., et al.,  Technique  1:11-15 (1989); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F.,  PCR Methods Applications  2:28-33 (1992); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in  PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual , C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995); Vartanian, J. P., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  14:2627-2631 (1996); Fromant, M., et al.,  Anal. Biochem.  224:347-353 (1995)). Error rate is increased by increasing the Mg++ concentration and by adding the mutagenic divalent metal ion Mn++. Misincorporation bias is reduced by manipulating the relative dNTP concentrations. However, because of the extreme sensitivity of pol Taq to changes in dNTP and Mn++ concentrations, the mutation number and type obtained in a mutant population are often not predictable or reproducible. Unbalancing the dNTP concentrations does not totally eliminate the misincorporation bias of pol Taq (Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in  PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual , C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995)). The modified PCR reaction conditions required frequently produce poor product yields and amplification artifacts (Id.).  \\n      At least two companies now offer random mutagenesis systems, Clontech and Stratagene. Clontech sells a system called Diversify PCR Random Mutagnesis Kit. Clontech&#39;s kit relies upon the use of Mn++ and nucleotide imbalance to control the mutation frequency and bias of pol Taq. This system suffers from the disadvantages already mentioned in trying to control the mutation frequency and mutation bias of pol Taq. An interesting positive feature of Clontech&#39;s kit is the inclusion of a rapid control reaction that allows the relative comparison of mutation rates in the control DNA fragment in two hours following PCR.  \\n      Stratagene sells a system called GeneMorph PCR Mutagenesis Kit. Stratagene has taken a different approach in their system. Rather than manipulating the error frequency of pol Taq, they manipulate the starting DNA concentration over 5 logs in PCR performed under one set of reaction conditions. This influences the number of mutations introduced in the final amplified DNA population as already discussed. They have also introduced the use of a new thermal stable DNA polymerase, Mutazyme\u2122, that has an error rate 5-10 times greater than pol Taq. This system suffers from the unpredictability of the number of mutations actually produced with a new DNA template at a selected concentration, and from the mutation pattern bias of Mutazyme\u2122.  \\n      Incorporation of Modified Nucleotides  \\n      Numerous methods and systems have been developed for the detection, quantitation, and analysis of polynucleotides in drug development, diagnostics, and research. These methods are used in disease diagnosis, for example by detecting polynucleotides of infectious organisms or detecting somatic and heritable mutations, and in basic and industrial research, for example by analyzing gene expression.  \\n      An expanding area of polynucleotide analysis is DNA array technology. This technology using arrays of nucleic acid probes, such as oligonucleotides, to detect complementary nucleic acid sequences in a sample nucleic acid of interest (the \u201ctarget\u201d nucleic acid). For example, an array of nucleic acid probes is fabricated at known locations on a substrate such as a chip. A labeled nucleic acid is then brought into contact with the chip and a scanner generates an image file indicating the locations where the labeled nucleic acids are bound to the chip. Based upon the image file and identities of the probes at specific locations, it becomes possible to extract information such as the expression pattern of a nucleic acid of interest (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,077).  \\n      Methods using arrays of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid substrate are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,270. In this method, an array of diverse nucleic acids is formed on a substrate. The fabrication of arrays of polymers, such as nucleic acids, on a solid substrate, and methods of use of the arrays in different assays, are described in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,203,989, 6,200,757, 6,180,351, 6,156,501, 6,083,726, 5,981,185, 5,744,101, 5,677,195, 5,624,711, 5,599,695, 5,445,934, 5,384,261, 5,571,639, 5,451,683, 5,424,186, 5,412,087, 5,384,261, 5,252,743 and 5,143,854; PCT WO 92/10092; PCT WO 93/09668; PCT WO 97/10365. Improved methods for minimizing the effects of random or systematic errors in array technology are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,223,127.  \\n      Accessing genetic information using high density DNA arrays is further described in Chee,  Science  274:610-614 (1996). The combination of photolithographic and fabrication techniques allows each probe sequence to occupy a very small site on the support. The site may be as small as a few microns or even a small molecule. Such probe arrays may be of the type known as Very Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis (VLSIPS\u2122). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,734 and 5,143,854 and PCT patent publication Nos. WO 90/15070 and 92/10092.  \\n      Typically, the existence of a nucleic acid of interest in array technology and other DNA detection methods is indicated by the presence or absence of an observable \u201clabel\u201d attached to a probe or attached to amplified sample DNA. A convenient method for incorporating a label or other modification into DNA would be to use in vitro amplification of a nucleic acid template using DNA polymerase. However, commercially available DNA polymerases are inefficient at incorporating modified nucleotides, particularly ones with bulky groups. Accordingly, there exists a need for more efficient incorporation of modified nucleotides, particularly labeled nucleotides, during amplification or synthesis of a nucleic acid template. Efficient incorporation of such nucleotides will allow for improved synthesis of labeled probes which may be used in the research market as well as in the field of diagnostics.  \\n      Translesion DNA Polymerases  \\n      In the past few years a new superfamily of DNA polymerases has been discovered whose members function in the replication of damaged DNA (Goodman, M.,  TIBS  25:189-195 (2000); Hubscher, U., et al.,  TIBS  25:143-147 (2000); Goodman, M. F. and Tippin, B.,  Curr. Opin. Genetics  &amp;  Dev.  10:162-168 (2000); Woodgate, R.,  Genes  &amp;  Dev.  13:2191-2195 (1999); Friedberg, E. C. and Gerlach, U. L.,  Cell  98:413-416 (1999); Johnson, R. E., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  96:12224-12226 (1999); Baynton, K. and Fuchs, R. P. P.,  TIBS  25:74-79 (2000); Friedberg, E. C., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  97:5681-5683 (2000); Zhang, Y., et al.,  Mol. Cell. Biol.  20:7099-7108 (2000); McDonald, J. P., et al.,  Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci.  356:53-60 (2001)). The superfamily is called UmuC/DinB/Rad30/Rcv1 after the four prototypic genes that define the subfamilies within this superfamily (see below). This superfamily will be referred to herein as the Translesion Superfamily of DNA polymerases, and includes  E. coli  pol IV and pol V, and eukaryotic pol \u03b6 (zeta), \u03b7 (eta), \u03b9 (iota), \u03ba (kappa), and \u03b8 (theta).  \\n      Previously identified DNA polymerase superfamilies include the A, B, C, and X Superfamilies. These superfamilies include, for example, (A)  E. coli  pol I, pol T7, pol T5, pol Taq, pol Tth, pol Tne, reverse transcriptases, and eukaryotic pol \u03b3 (gamma); (B)  E. coli  pol II, eukaryotic pol \u03b1 (alpha), eukaryotic \u03b4 (delta), eukaryotic \u03b5 (epsilon), pol T4, pol \u03a629, pol Pfu, and pol KOD (Pfx); (C)  E. coli  pol III \u03b1 subunit; and (X) eukaryotic pol \u03b2 (beta), eukaryotic \u03bb (lambda), eukaryotic \u03bc (mu), and TdT.  \\n      Pol III holoenzyme is a member of the C Superfamily of DNA polymerases. It represents the typical genome replicative DNA polymerase with high fidelity (exo+; contains proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity), high processivity (once bound to a template-primer it remains bound through many polymerization events), and minimal ability to bypass lesions in DNA.  \\n      The Translesion Superfamily members have several unusual characteristics that set them apart from other DNA polymerases. For example, these DNA polymerases are highly error prone (Table 1). A typical replicative DNA polymerase, such as  E. coli  pol III holoenzyme, has an error rate (mutations introduced/nucleotide incorporated) of about 5\u00d710 \u22126  (Matsuda, T. et al.  Nature  404: 1011-1013 (2000)). Enzymes previously thought to be error prone include two retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) and pol Taq, whose error rates are 0.5-1\u00d710 \u22124 . Notably, members of the Translesion Superfamily, pol \u03ba (kappa) and pol \u03b7 (eta) in particular, have error rates of 2-4\u00d710 \u22122  (Table 1). Thus, they make an error once in every 25 to 50 nucleotides incorporated. A third member, pol \u03b9, actually violates Watson-Crick base-pairing rules in its nucleotide incorporation preferences (Table 2).  \\n               TABLE 1                          Base

First, they are nonprocessive; that is, they dissociate from template-primer after almost every nucleotide incorporation event. Second, the mutation frequency spectra of the Translesion enzymes, particularly pol \u03ba and pol \u03b7, are much more uniform than that of pol Taq, the DNA polymerase presently used to generate random mutations (Table 3). Therefore, mutations introduced by pol \u03ba or pol \u03b7, for example, will have a much-reduced bias towards a particular type. Third, they also lack proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity.  \\n               TABLE 3                          Distribution Pattern of Mutation Frequencies of DNA Polymerases a                           Relative Mutation Frequency                                             Mutation   Pol   Pol       M-MLV   AMV       Pol                                                     T/N b     Transition   Transversion   III   IV   hPol \u03ba   RT   RT   hPol \u03b7   Taq                                                             G/T   G\u2192A       1.5   1.7   15   9   6   5.3   2       T/G   T\u2192C       1   14   24   6   7   22.8   17.7       A/C   A\u2192G       1   1   8   5   31   4.3   1       C/A   C\u2192T       8.5   4.3   10   1   0   4.8   2       G/G       G\u2192C   4   4.3   10   4   0   1   2       G/A       G\u2192T   1.5   1   10   4   1   1.8   2       T/T       T\u2192A   1.5   8.7   6.5   9   7   3.3   1       T/C       T\u2192G   1   2.7   68   9   7   2.0   0       A/A       A\u2192T   1   16   3   6   6   6.5   0       A/G       A\u2192C   1.5   6.3   1   3   4   5.3   1       C/C       C\u2192G   1   1   3   1   2   0   1       C/T       C\u2192A   1   3.7   14   0   2   1.3   0                   a For each DNA polymerase, values were derived from the mutation frequencies in Table 2 by setting the lowest frequency value above 0 at 1 and calculating a ratio to the remaining values              b T/N template nucleotide and dNTP incorporated             \\n \\n Subfamilies of Translesion DNA Polymerases \\n \\n      1. The  E. coli  UmuC (Pol V) Subfamily.  \\n      (See, e.g., Bruck, I., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  271:10767-10774 (1996); Tang, M., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  96:8919-8924 (1999); Reuven, N. B., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  274:31763-31766 (1999); Maor-Shoshani, A., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pol V has low processivity, dissociating after incorporation of 6 to 8 nucleotides under the best of conditions and is distributive in the absence of accessory proteins (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000)).  \\n      Pol V requires RecA*, \u03b2 processivity clamp, \u03b3 clamp-loading complex (5 proteins), and ssb to carry out efficient copying of DNA (Pham, P., et al.,  Nature  409:366-370 (2001)). This complex of proteins is called a mutasome or Pol V mut (UmuD\u2032 2 C/RecA*/\u03b2,\u03b3 complex/ssb). Pol V mut has a relatively high rate of base mispair formation when copying DNA with rates of 10 \u22123  to 10 \u22124  (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000)) (Table 1). In copying DNA with Pol V, it appears that ATP\u03b3-S can be substituted for \u03b2, \u03b3 complex (Pham, P., et al.,  Nature  409: 366-370 (2001). There is no data available on whether the combination of just Pol V, ssb, and ATP\u03b3-S could be used to copy DNA efficiently.  \\n      2.

Cell  4:281-286 (1999); Wagner, J. and Nohmi, T., J. Bacteriol. 182:4587-4595 (1999)). Pol IV has no 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000); Wagner, J., et al.,  Mol. Cell  4:281-286 (1999)). It has low processivity (dissociates after 6 to 8 nucleotides) under the best of conditions (in the presence of accessory factors) (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000)), and is distributive in the absence of accessory proteins (Wagner, J., et al.,  Mol. Cell  4:281-286 (1999)).  \\n      The copying efficiency of Pol IV is increased dramatically by ssb and \u03b2,\u03b3 complex (particularly \u03b2,\u03b3 complex) (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000)).  \\n      Pol IV is less error prone than pol V mut when copying DNA with mispair formation rates of 10 \u22124  to 10 \u22125  (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000)) (Table 1). Pol IV is prone to elongate bulged (misaligned) template-primer (Wagner, J., et al.,  Mol. Cell  4:281-286 (1999)), resulting in single-base deletions in DNA products (Wagner, J. and Nohmi, T.,  J. Bacteriol.  182:4587-4595 (1999)). Pol IV base substitution errors are biased towards a G substitution for another base and most often occur at the sequence 5\u2032-GX-3\u2032 where X represents the base (T, A, or C) that is mutated to G (Tang, M., et al.,  Nature  404:1014-1018 (2000); Wagner, J. and Nohmi, T.,  J. Bacteriol.  182:4587-4595 (1999)).  \\n      Pol \u03ba (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA  96:11922-11927 (1999); Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  J. Biol.

Dev.  14:1589-1594 (2000); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)) (also called pol \u03b8, Johnson, R. E.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA  97:3838-3843 (2000)) is the gene product of the human and mouse DinB1 gene (870 aa; 99 KDa) (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA  96:11922-11927 (1999); Gerlach, V.

Dev.  14:1589-1594 (2000); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)).  \\n      Pol \u03ba has no 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  276:92-98 (2001); Ohashi, E., et al.,  Gen. Dev.  14:1589-1594 (2000)). The processivity of full-length pol \u03ba is moderate (\u02dc25 nt) (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  276:92-98 (2001); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)), and the processivity of a C-terminal truncated pol \u03ba in which a putative DNA binding domain has been deleted is low (Ohashi, E., et al.,  Gen. Dev.  14:1589-1594 (2000); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)).  \\n      Addition of human PCNA (the human sliding clamp analogous to  E. coli  \u03b2,\u03b3-complex for maintaining processivity of pol \u03b4 during chain elongation) did not increase the processivity of pol \u03ba on undamaged DNA templates (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  276:92-98 (2001)). The effects of RP-A (ssb) and PCNA together have not been determined.  \\n      Like  E. coli  pol IV, human pol \u03ba can prime synthesis from a misaligned (bulged) template-primer (Gerlach, V. L., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  276:92-98 (2001); Zhang, Y., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  28:4138-4146 (2000)). The error rate of pol \u03ba on undamaged DNA templates is 5\u00d710 \u22123  or one error for every 200 nucleotides synthesized (Zhang, Y., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  28:4138-4146 (2000); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)) (Table 2). Most of these errors (64-90%) are single-base misinsertions and not deletions or insertions (Zhang, Y., et al.,  Nuc. Acids Res.  28:4138-4146 (2000); Ohashi, E., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  275:39678-39684 (2000)).  \\n      3.

It incorporates a C opposite an abasic site at the 3\u2032 end of a DNA primer in a template-dependent reaction (Nelson J. R., et al.,  Nature  382:729-731 (1996)). dCTP transferase does not add nucleotides beyond the C incorporated at an abasic site (Nelson J.

R., et al.,  Science  272:1646-1649 (1996)) and relatively low processivity (Nelson, J. R., et al.,  Science  272:1646-1649 (1996)). Pol \u03b6 efficiently synthesizes DNA from most mispaired 3\u2032 ends and the error rate for mispair extension is extraordinarily high at 10 \u22121  to 10 \u22122  (Johnson, R. E., et al.,  Nature  406:1015-1019 (2000)). The error rate of pol (on undamaged DNA for mispair formation is relatively low at 10 \u22124  to 10 \u22125  (Johnson, R.

Biol. Chem.  275:8233-8239 (2000)) and has low processivity. Most pol \u03b7 molecules will dissociate after no more than 6 nucleotides are incorporated (Washington, M. T., et al.,  J. Biol. Chem.  274:36835-36838 (1999); Bebenek, K., et al.,  J. Biol.

The average rate of mispair extension by pol \u03b7 is less than the rate of mispair formation (10 \u22123 ) (Washington, M. T., et al.,  J. Biol.

The average error frequency of pol \u03b7 for copying undamaged DNA for single base substitutions is 1 in 28 nucleotides incorporated (Matsuda, T., et al.,  Nature  404:1011-1013 (2000)) (Table 2).  \\n      5. The Human RAD30B (Pol \u03b9) Subfamily.  \\n      (See, e.g., Johnson, R. E., et al.,  Nature  406:1015-1019 (2000), Tissier, A., et al.,  The EMBO J.  19:5259-5266 (2000); Zhang, Y., et al.,  Mol.

Pol \u03b9 has no 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity (Johnson, R. E., et al.,  Nature  406:1015-1019 (2000); Zhang, Y., et al.,  Mol. Cell. Biol.  20:7099-7108 (2000)). It appears to be nonprocessive and has difficulty extending primers beyond 6 bases, even with an undamaged DNA template (Johnson, R. E., et al.,  Nature  406:1015-1019 (2000)). This is due in part to the tendency of pol \u03b9 to incorporate a G next to template T more readily than A, and its inability to efficiently extend the T-G mispair (Zhang, Y., et al.,  Mol. Cell. Biol.  20:7099-7108 (2000)).  \\n      Pol \u03b9 has extraordinarily high rates of mispair formation at template pyrimidines, T (0.3 to 10) and C (0.02 to 0.07); and lower rates at template purines, G (0.005 to 0.04) and A (0.01\u00d710 \u22124  to 3\u00d710 \u22124 ) (Johnson, R.

Dev.  14:1642-1650 (2000)) (Table 2).  \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n      The present invention provides kits, compositions and methods useful in overcoming limitations in random mutagenesis and incorporation of modified nucleotides. The methods of the present invention relate generally to methods of synthesizing or amplifying nucleic acid molecules using one or more Translesion DNA polymerases.  \\n      In one aspect, the invention relates to kits and methods and compositions for incorporating random mutations or changes (preferably randomly) in DNA molecules. In this aspect, one or more template nucleic acid molecules and at least one Translesion DNA polymerase are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule (which may be complementary to all or a portion of said one or more of said templates). Such conditions generally require at least one primer and one or more nucleotides (e.g., dNTPs), and may also require buffers, salts and/or accessory proteins. A Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates at least one mutation (which may be one or more deletions, substitutions and insertions or combinations thereof of one or more nucleotides) in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be performed to incorporate any number of such mutations which are preferably random mutations. One or more non-translesion DNA polymerases may also be used in the present methods. The resulting complementary nucleic acid molecules (mutagenized nucleic acid molecules) may be further amplified using standard amplification techniques such as PCR. More than one Translesion DNA polymerase (which may be the same or different) and more than one non-translesion DNA polymerase (which may be the same or different) may be used. Such polymerases may be mesophilic or thermophilic.  \\n      In a preferred aspect, one or more mismatch nucleotides are added to the nucleic acid molecule made by the methods of the invention to produce one or a population of randomly mutagenized nucleic acid molecules and such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be used to produce one or a population of polypeptides or proteins having any number of changes in amino acid sequences. Preferably, one or more amino acid substitutions are created in such polypeptides, although other types of changes or combination or changes in amino acid sequence can take place including one or more deletion of amino acids, and one or more insertions of amino acids. Thus, the invention provides methods and requests capable of producing one or more and preferably populations of mutagenized nucleic acid molecules (which may comprise any number of substitution, insertion and/or deletion mutations) and such nucleic acid molecules may be used to produce mutagenized polypeptides or proteins. Such proteins or populations of proteins may then be analyzed for desired functional or activity changes using well known techniques and functional or activity assays. Proteins or polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be produced by expression of the nucleic acid molecules in a host cell or by using in vitro transcription/translation systems known in the art.  \\n      The invention further provides mutagenized nucleic acids produced by the above-described methods and host cells comprising mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention. Such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Mutagenized nucleic acids are useful for structure-function studies and for optimizing encoded mRNA and polypeptides. Such molecules, especially polypeptides, can be assayed for improved enzymatic activities, receptor properties, ligand interactions, antibiotic or antiviral properties, vaccine efficacy, or antibody binding affinity. The invention also provides polypeptides encoded by the mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention.  \\n      In another aspect, the present invention relates to kits and methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. In this aspect, one or more template nucleic acid molecules, at least one Translesion DNA polymerase, and one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different) are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule (which may be complementary to all or a portion of said one or more of said templates). Such conditions generally require at least one primer and one or more nucleotides (e.g., dNTPs), and may also require buffers, salts and/or accessory proteins. The Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates the one or more (which may be the same or different) modified nucleotides in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be used. More than one Translesion DNA polymerase and more than one non-translesion DNA polymerase may be used. Such polymerases may be mesophilic or thermophilic.  \\n      The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules produced according to the above-described methods. Such modified nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded and may comprise any number of the same or different modified nucleotides. Modified nucleic acid molecules include labeled nucleic acid molecules and are useful as detection probes. Depending on the modified nucleotide(s) used during synthesis, the modified molecules may contain one or a number of modifications. Where multiple modifications are used, the molecules may comprise a number of the same or different modifications such as labels. Thus, one type or multiple different modified nucleotides may be used during synthesis of nucleic acid molecules to provide for the modified nucleic acid molecules of the invention. Such modified nucleic acid molecules will thus comprise one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different). The invention also provides uses of the modified nucleic acids for analyzing samples. \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS  \\n       FIG. 1  is a schematic of the random mutagenesis technique using a mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerase. Increased temperature during amplification may inactivate or partially inactivate Translesion DNA polymerase activity such that introduction of mutations with Translesion DNA polymerase during PCR is limited or eliminated. Use of thermophilic Translesion DNA polymerase during amplification may provide for additional mutagenesis of the nucleic acid molecules. \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n     Definitions  \\n      In the description that follows, a number of terms used in recombinant DNA technology are utilized extensively.

Such libraries may or may not be contained in one or more vectors.  \\n      Vector.  \\n      As used herein, a \u201cvector\u201d is a plasmid, cosmid, phagemid or phage DNA or other DNA molecule which is able to replicate autonomously in a host cell, and which is characterized by one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which such DNA sequences may be cut in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, and into which DNA may be inserted in order to bring about its replication and cloning. The vector may further contain a marker suitable for use in the identification of cells transformed with the vector. Markers, for example, include but are not limited to tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance.  \\n      Primer.  \\n      As used herein, \u201cprimer\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule that is extended by covalent bonding of nucleotide monomers during amplification or polymerization of a DNA molecule. A primer may be attached to the DNA molecule to be amplified, via hairpin or other means, or it may be a separate molecule.  \\n      Template.  \\n      The term \u201ctemplate\u201d as used herein refers to a double-stranded or single-stranded nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) molecule which is to be amplified (copied), synthesized, mutagenized, or modified. In the case of a double-stranded molecule, denaturation of its strands to form a first and a second strand is performed before these molecules may be amplified, copied, mutagenized, or modified. A primer, complementary to a portion of a template is hybridized under appropriate conditions and a DNA polymerase may then synthesize a nucleic acid molecule complementary to said template or a portion thereof. The newly synthesized molecule, according to the invention, may be equal to or shorter in length than the original template. Mismatch incorporation and/or insertions and/or deletions during the synthesis or extension of the newly synthesized molecule may result in one or a number of changes or mismatched base pairs. Thus, the synthesized molecule need not be exactly complementary to the template. The template may be one or more molecules, such as a polulation of molecules.  \\n      Incorporating.  \\n      The term \u201cincorporating\u201d as used herein means becoming a part of a nucleic acid molecule such as a nucleotide becoming part of a DNA primer or probe or other DNA molecule. In a preferred embodiment, one or more modified nucleotides are incorporated into a DNA molecule such as a probe or primer. In another preferred embodiment, one or more modified nucleotides are incorporated into a DNA molecule for use in DNA array technology.  \\n      Random Mutagensis.  \\n      The term \u201crandom mutagenesis\u201d refers to non-directed mismatch incorporation that may occur anywhere on a nucleic acid molecule. A mismatch may be any type of misincorporation such as a transition, a transversion, a deletion, or an insertion. Mismatches are also referred to herein as mutations. A nucleic acid produced by random mutagenesis may be referred to herein as \u201crandomized\u201d or \u201cmutagenized\u201d or grammatical equivalents thereof.  \\n      Amplification.  \\n      As used herein \u201camplification\u201d refers to any in vitro method for increasing the number of copies of a nucleotide sequence with the use of a polymerase. Amplification may be linear or may be exponential. Nucleic acid amplification results in the incorporation of nucleotides into a DNA molecule such as a primer or probe thereby forming a new molecule complementary to a template. The formed nucleic acid molecule and its template may be used as templates to synthesize additional nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, one amplification reaction may consist of many rounds of replication. DNA amplification reactions include, for example, polymerase chain reactions (PCR). One PCR reaction may consist of 5 to 100 \u201ccycles\u201d of denaturation and synthesis of a DNA molecule.  \\n      Oligonucleotide.  \\n      \u201cOligonucleotide\u201d refers to a synthetic or natural molecule comprising a covalently linked sequence of nucleotides which are joined by a phosphodiester bond between the 3\u2032 position of the deoxyribose or ribose of one nucleotide and the 5\u2032 position of the deoxyribose or ribose of the adjacent nucleotide.  \\n      Nucleotide.  \\n      As used herein \u201cnucleotide\u201d refers to a base-sugar-phosphate combination. Nucleotides are monomeric units of a nucleic acid sequence (DNA and RNA). The term nucleotide includes ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) ATP, UTP, CTG, GTP and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) such as dATP, dCTP, dITP, dUTP, dGTP, dTTP, or derivatives thereof. Such derivatives include, for example, [\u03b1S]dATP, 7-deaza-dGTP and 7-deaza-dATP, and nucleotide derivatives that confer nuclease resistance on the nucleic acid molecule containing them. The term nucleotide as used herein also refers to dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) and their derivatives. Illustrated examples of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates include, but are not limited to, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddITP, and ddTTP. According to the present invention, a \u201cnucleotide\u201d may be unlabeled or detectably labeled by well known techniques. Detectable labels include, for example, radioactive labels, metal labels such as gold, magnetic resonance labels, dye labels, fluorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, electrochemiluminescent labels (ECL; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,174,709 and 5,610,017), bioluminescent labels, enzyme labels, antigenic determinants detectable by an antibody, biotin labels, and digoxigenin labels (DIG).

DIG labels include digoxigenin-11-UTP available from Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind., and biotin labels include biotin-21-UTP and amino-7-dUTP available from Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif. The term nucleotide includes modified nucleotides.  \\n      Modified Nucleotide.  \\n      The term \u201cmodified nucleotide\u201d refers to a nucleotide other than dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Thus, the term modified nucleotide excludes dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The term modified nucleotide includes ddNTPs, and nucleotide derivatives such as ddNTP derivatives, dNTP derivatives, and NTP derivatives. Modified nucleotides also include labeled nucleotides. Preferred modified nucleotides include nucleotides that are bulky relative to dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Many examples of modified nucleotides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,757.  \\n      Hybridization.  \\n      The terms \u201chybridization\u201d and \u201chybridizing\u201d refers to base pairing of two complementary single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (RNA and/or DNA) to give a double-stranded molecule. As used herein, two nucleic acid molecules may be hybridized, although the base pairing is not completely complementary. Accordingly, mismatched bases do not prevent hybridization of two nucleic acid molecules provided that appropriate conditions, well known in the art, are used.  \\n      Unit.  \\n      The term \u201cunit\u201d as used herein refers to the activity of an enzyme. When referring, for example, to a thermostable DNA polymerase, one unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that will incorporate 10 nanomoles of dNTPs into acid-insoluble material (i.e., DNA or RNA) in 30 minutes under standard primed DNA synthesis conditions.  \\n      Probes.  \\n      The term \u201cprobes\u201d refers to single or double stranded nucleic acid molecules or oligonucleotides which are used to detect or analyze a nucleic acid of interest. In some embodiments, a probe is unlabeled. For example, in array technology, nucleic acid probes bound to the substrate (e.g., chip) are unlabeled and the nucleic acid of interest is labeled. In other embodiments, a probe is detectably labeled by one or more detectable markers or labels. For example, in Southern and northern blot analysis, the probe is labeled and the nucleic acid of interest is unlabeled. Such labels or markers may be the same or different and may include radioactive labels, magnetic resonance labels, dye labels, fluorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, electrochemiluminescent labels (ECL), bioluminescent labels, enzyme labels, antigenic determinants detectable by an antibody, biotin labels, and digoxigenin labels (DIG), although one or more fluorescent labels (which are the same or different) are preferred in accordance with the invention. Probes have specific utility in the detection of nucleic acid molecules by hybridization and thus may be used in diagnostic assays. Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) labels are those which become luminescent species when acted on electrochemically. They provide a sensitive and precise measurement of the presence and concentration of an analyte of interest. In such techniques, the sample is exposed to a voltammetric working electrode in order to trigger luminescence. The light produced by the label is measured and indicates the presence or quantity of the analyte. Such ECL techniques are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,017, WO86/02734 and WO87/06706.  \\n      Expression.  \\n      Expression is the process by which a polynucleotide produces a mRNA or a polypeptide. It involves transcription of the polynucleotide into messenger RNA (mRNA) and, in the case of polypeptide expression, translation of such mRNA into polypeptide(s).  \\n      Recombinant Host.  \\n      The term \u201crecombinant host\u201d as used herein refers to any prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganism which contains the desired cloned genes in an expression vector, cloning vector or any other nucleic acid molecule. The term \u201crecombinant host\u201d is also meant to include those host cells which have been genetically engineered to contain the desired gene on a host chromosome or in the host genome.  \\n      Host.  \\n      The term \u201chost\u201d as used herein refers to any prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganism that is the recipient of a replicable expression vector, cloning vector or any nucleic acid molecule including the inhibitory nucleic acid molecules of the invention. The nucleic acid molecule may contain, but is not limited to, a structural gene, a promoter and/or an origin of replication.  \\n      Promoter.  \\n      The term \u201cpromoter\u201d as used herein refers to a DNA sequence generally described as the 5\u2032 region of a gene, located proximal to start the codon. At the promoter region, transcription of an adjacent gene(s) is initiated.  \\n      Gene.  \\n      The term \u201cgene\u201d as used herein refers to a DNA sequence that contains information necessary for expression of a polypeptide or protein. It includes the promoter and the structural gene as well as other sequences involved in expression of the protein.  \\n      Structural Gene.  \\n      The term \u201cstructural gene\u201d as used herein refers to a DNA sequence that is transcribed into messenger RNA that is then translated into a sequence of amino acids characteristic of a specific polypeptide.  \\n      Operably Linked.  \\n      The term \u201coperably linked\u201d as used herein means that the promoter is positioned to control the initiation of expression of the polypeptide encoded by the structural gene.  \\n      Substantially Pure.  \\n      As used herein \u201csubstantially pure\u201d means that the desired purified molecule such as a protein or nucleic acid molecule (including the inhibitory nucleic acid molecule of the invention) is essentially free from contaminants which are typically associated with the desired molecule.  \\n      Contaminating components may include, but are not limited to, compounds or molecules which may interfere with the inhibitory or synthesis reactions of the invention, and/or that degrade or digest the inhibitory nucleic acid molecules of the invention (such as nucleases including exonucleases and endonucleases) or that degrade or digest the synthesized or amplified nucleic acid molecules produced by the methods of the invention.  \\n      Thermostable.  \\n      As used herein \u201cthermostable\u201d refers to a DNA polymerase which is more resistant to inactivation by heat. DNA polymerases synthesize the formation of a DNA molecule complementary to a single-stranded DNA template by extending a primer in the 5\u2032-3\u2032-direction. This activity for mesophilic DNA polymerases may be inactivated by heat treatment. For example, T5 DNA polymerase activity is totally inactivated by exposing the enzyme to a temperature of 90\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds. As used herein, a thermostable DNA polymerase activity is more resistant to heat inactivation than a mesophilic DNA polymerase. However, a thermostable DNA polymerase does not mean to refer to an enzyme which is totally resistant to heat inactivation and thus heat treatment may reduce the DNA polymerase activity to some extent. A thermostable DNA polymerase typically will also have a higher optimum temperature than mesophilic DNA polymerases.  \\n      3\u2032-to-5\u2032 Exonuclease Activity.  \\n      \u201c3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity\u201d is an enzymatic activity well known to the art. This activity is often associated with DNA polymerases and is thought to be involved in a DNA replication \u201cediting\u201d or correction mechanism.  \\n      A \u201cDNA polymerase substantially reduced in 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity\u201d is defined herein as either (1) a mutated DNA polymerase that has about or less than 10%, or preferably about or less than 1%, of the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the corresponding unmutated, wild-type enzyme, or (2) a DNA polymerase having a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease specific activity which is less than about 1 unit/mg protein, or preferably about or less than 0.1 units/mg protein. A unit of activity of 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease is defined as the amount of activity that solubilizes 10 nmoles of substrate ends in 60 min. at 37\u00b0 C., assayed as described in the \u201cBRL 1989 Catalogue &amp; Reference Guide\u201d, page 5, with HhaI fragments of lambda DNA 3\u2032-end labeled with [ 3 H]dTTP by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Protein is measured by the method of Brandford, Anal. Biochem. 72:248 (1976). As a means of comparison, natural, wild-type T5-DNA polymerase (DNAP) or T5-DNAP encoded by pTTQ19-T5-2 has a specific activity of about 10 units/mg protein while the DNA polymerase encoded by pTTQ19-T5-2(Exo-) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,179) has a specific activity of about 0.0001 units/mg protein, or 0.001% of the specific activity of the unmodified enzyme, a 10 5 -fold reduction. Polymerases used in accordance with the invention may lack or may be substantially reduced in 3\u2032 exonuclease activity.  \\n      5\u2032-to-3\u2032 Exonuclease Activity.  \\n      \u201c5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease activity\u201d is also enzymatic activity well known in the art. This activity is often associated with DNA polymerases, such as  E. coli  Poll and Taq DNA polymerase.  \\n      A \u201cpolymerase substantially reduced in 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease activity\u201d is defined herein as either (1) mutated or modified polymerase that has about or less than 10%, or preferably about or less than 1%, of the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease activity of the corresponding unmutated, wild-type enzyme, or (2) a polymerase having 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease specific activity which is less than about 1 unit/mg protein, or preferably about or less than 0.1 units/mg protein.  \\n      Both of the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 and 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease activities can be observed on sequencing gels. Active 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonuclease activity will produce different size products in a sequencing gel by removing mono-nucleotides and longer products from the 5\u2032-end of the growing primers. 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity can be measured by following the degradation of radiolabeled primers in a sequencing gel. Thus, the relative amounts of these activities (e.g., by comparing wild-type and mutant or modified polymerases) can be determined with no more than routine experimentation.  \\n      Distributive.  \\n      As used herein, \u201cdistributive\u201d polymerases generally incorporate one nucleotide before disassociating from the template nucleic acid molecule.  \\n      Non Processive.  \\n      As used herein, \u201cnon processive\u201d polymerases generally incorporate fewer than ten (10) nucleotides before disassociating from the template nucleic acid molecule.  \\n      Processive.  \\n      As used herein, \u201cprocessive\u201d polymerases generally incorporate hundreds of nucleotides before disassociating from the template nucleic acid molecule. \u201cModerately processive\u201d polymerases generally incorporate ten (10) or more nucleotides but fewer than hundreds of nucleotides before disassociating from the template nucleic acid molecule.  \\n      Other terms used in the fields of recombinant DNA technology and molecular and cell biology as used herein will be generally understood by one of ordinary skill in the applicable arts.  \\n      Overview  \\n      The present invention provides kits, compositions and methods useful in overcoming limitations in random mutagenesis and incorporation of modified nucleotides. The present invention achieves previously unattainable mutation frequencies of 2 to 20 base pairs per 1,000 nucleotides in one round of mutagenesis. The invention also facilitates the production of modified, e.g., labeled, nucleic acid molecules not heretofore possible.  \\n      Mutagenesis.  \\n      The methods of the present invention relate generally to methods of synthesizing and/or amplifying nucleic acid molecules. In one aspect, the invention relates to kits and methods for incorporating mutations, preferably randomly, in DNA molecules. In this aspect, a template nucleic acid molecule and a Translesion DNA polymerase are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule. Such conditions generally require at least one primer and dNTPs, and may also require salts and/or accessory proteins. A Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates at least one random mutation in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be performed to incorporate random mutations. The mutation rate may be altered up or down by including Translesion DNA polymerases and non-translesion DNA polymerases with various misincorporation rates in the method. The resulting complementary nucleic acid molecules or population of nucleic acid molecules (mutagenized nucleic acid molecules) may be further amplified using standard amplification techniques such as PCR.  \\n      The invention further provides mutagenized nucleic acids produced by the methods of the invention. Such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Mutagenized nucleic acids are useful for structure-function studies and for optimizing encoded mRNA and polypeptides. Such molecules, especially polypeptides, can be assayed for improved enzymatic activities, receptor properties, ligand interactions, antibiotic or antiviral properties, vaccine efficacy, or antibody binding affinity. The invention also provides polypeptides encoded by the mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention.  \\n      Modified Polynucleotides.  \\n      In another aspect, the present invention relates to kits and methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. In this aspect, a template nucleic acid molecule, a Translesion DNA polymerase, and a modified nucleotide are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule. Such conditions generally require at least one primer and dNTPs, and may also require salts and/or accessory proteins. The Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates the modified nucleotide in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be used.  \\n      In accordance with the invention, the amount of modified, e.g., labeled, product is preferably measured based on percent incorporation of the modification of interest into synthesized product as may be determined by one skilled in the art, although other means of measuring the amount or efficiency of modification will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. The invention provides for enhanced or increased percent incorporation of modified nucleotide during synthesis of a nucleic acid molecule from a template  \\n      The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules produced according to the above-described methods. Such modified nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Modified nucleic acid molecules include labeled nucleic acid molecules and are useful as detection probes. Depending on the modified nucleotide(s) used during synthesis, the modified molecules may contain one or a number of modifications. Where multiple modifications are used, the molecules may comprise a number of the same or different modifications such as labels. Thus, one type or multiple different modified nucleotides may be used during synthesis of nucleic acid molecules to provide for the modified nucleic acid molecules of the invention. Such modified nucleic acid molecules will thus comprise one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different).  \\n      DNA Polymerases  \\n      A variety of Translesion DNA polymerases may be used in the present methods.

More than one Translesion DNA polymerase may be used in the present methods. For example, two, three, four, five, six, or more Translesion DNA polymerases may be used. Preferred combinations of Translesion DNA polymerases for use in the random mutagenesis methods include Pol \u03b6 with one or more other Translesion DNA polymerases such as Pol \u03ba or Pol \u03b7. Thus, for example, Pol \u03b6 may be used in combination with either Pol \u03ba or Pol \u03b7 or it may be used with both Pol \u03ba and Pol \u03b7. Translesion DNA polymerases may also be used in combination with one or more non-translesion DNA polymerases in the present methods, as described below.  \\n      Preferred Translesion DNA polymerases for use in synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules include those able to incorporate nucleotides across from bulky lesions in damaged DNA or those which are able to violate Watson-Crick base pairing, such as Pol \u03b9 and Pol \u03b7.

In methods using more than two Translesion DNA polymerases, the ratios may be from 10:1:1 to 1:10:1 to 1:1:10, and any ratio in between.  \\n      Translesion DNA polymerases used in the present invention may be isolated from natural or recombinant sources, by techniques that are well-known in the art (see below), from a variety of cells, cells lines, and bacteria that are available commercially (for example, from American Type Culture Collection, Manassass, Va., and see below) or may be obtained by recombinant DNA techniques using publicly available sequences or degenerate sequences (see below).

Acids Res.  22:3259-3260 (1994)).  \\n      Reverse transcriptases for use in this invention include any enzyme having reverse transcriptase activity. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, retroviral reverse transcriptase, retrotransposon reverse transcriptase, hepatitis B reverse transcriptase, cauliflower mosaic virus reverse transcriptase, bacterial reverse transcriptase, Tth DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase (Saiki, R. K., et al,  Science  239:487-491 (1988); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,818 and 4,965,188), Tne DNA polymerase (WO 96/10640 and WO 97/09451), Tma DNA polymerase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,374,553) and mutants, variants or derivatives thereof (see, e.g., WO 97/09451 and WO 98/47912). Preferred enzymes for use in the invention include those that have reduced, substantially reduced or eliminated RNase H activity. By an enzyme \u201csubstantially reduced in RNase H activity\u201d is meant that the enzyme has less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 15%, 10% or 5%, and most preferably less than about 2%, of the RNase H activity of the corresponding wildtype or RNase H+ enzyme such as wildtype Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV), Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) or Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) reverse transcriptases. The RNase H activity of any enzyme may be determined by a variety of assays, such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,797, in Kotewicz, M. L., et al,  Nucl. Acids Res.  16:265 (1988) and in Gerard, G. F., et al.,  FOCUS  14(5):91 (1992), the disclosures of all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred polypeptides for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, M-MLV reverse transcriptase, RSV reverse transcriptase, AMV reverse transcriptase, RAV (rous-associated virus) reverse transcriptase, MAV (myeloblastosis-associated virus) reverse transcriptase and HIV reverse transcriptase, any of which may be RNase H minus (RNase H-) (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,797 and WO 98/47912). It will be understood by one of ordinary skill, however, that any enzyme capable of producing a DNA molecule from a ribonucleic acid molecule (i.e., having reverse transcriptase activity) may be equivalently used in the compositions, methods and kits of the invention.  \\n      The non-translesion DNA polymerase may be exonuclease minus (exo \u2212 ) (i.e., lacks proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 and/or 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity), substantially reduced in exonuclease activity or exonuclease plus (exo + ). In the random mutagenesis methods, an exo+ non-translesion DNA polymerase is preferred in combination with a Translesion DNA polymerase. For amplification of long nucleic acid molecules (e.g., nucleic acid molecules longer than about 3-5 Kb in length), at least two DNA polymerases (one substantially lacking 3\u2032 exonuclease activity and the other having 3\u2032 exonuclease activity) are typically used. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,149; U.S. Pat. No.5,512,462; Barnes, W. M.,  Gene  112:29-35 (1992); and WO 98/06736, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties. Examples of DNA polymerases substantially lacking in 3\u2032 exonuclease activity include, but are not limited to, Taq, Tne (exo \u2212 ), Tma (exo \u2212 ), Pfu (exo \u2212 ), Pwo (exo \u2212 ) and Tth DNA polymerases, and mutants, variants and derivatives thereof.  \\n      The non-translesion DNA polymerases used in the present invention may be isolated from natural or recombinant sources, by techniques that are well-known in the art (See Bej and Mahbubani, Id.; WO 92/06200; WO 96/10640), from a variety of cell lines and organisms that are available commercially (for example, from American Type Culture Collection, Manassass, Va.) or may be obtained by recombinant DNA techniques (WO 96/10640). Suitable for use as sources of thermostable enzymes or the genes thereof for expression in recombinant systems are the thermophilic bacteria  Thermus thermophilus, Thermococcus litoralis, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus woosii  and other species of the  Pyrococcus  genus,  Bacillus sterothermophilus, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Thermus flavus, Thermus ruber, Thermus brockianus, Thermotoga neapolitana, Thermotoga maritima  and other species of the  Thermotoga  genus, and  Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum , and mutants thereof. It is to be understood, however, that thermostable enzymes from other organisms may also be used in the present invention without departing from the scope or preferred embodiments thereof. As an alternative to isolation, thermostable enzymes (e.g., DNA polymerases) are available commercially from, for example, Invitrogen Corporation, New England Biolabs, Finnzymes Oy and Perkin Elmer Cetus.  \\n      Preferred non-translesion DNA polymerases in the present invention are T7 DNA Polymerase, T4 DNA Polymerase,  E. coli  DNA Polymerase I, Klenow Fragment DNA Polymerase, and Tne DNA Polymerase.  \\n      The ratio of Translesion DNA polymerase to non-translesion DNA polymerase maybe from 10:1 to 1:10, more specifically, 10:1, 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, and 1:10.  \\n      The present inventions also call for the exclusion of one or more particular non-translesion DNA polymerases. For example, one method, composition or kit may comprise one or more Translesion DNA polymerase and one or more non-translesion polymerase, wherein the non-translesion DNA polymerase is not E. coli DNA Polymerase Pol T, or Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The invention may call for the combination of at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase, selected from the group consisting of: (i)  E. coli  Pol V, wherein said non-translesion DNA polymerase is not  E. coli  Pol III core, (ii)  E. coli  Pol V, wherein said non-translesion DNA polymerase is not  E. coli  Pol III holoenzyme, and (iii)  E. coli  Pol IV, wherein said non-translesion DNA polymerase is not Klenow fragment. Other non-translesion DNA polymerases which may be excluded from the present methods, compositions and kits include any described above or known in the art. In some embodiments, the at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase will be from different hosts, cells, or cell lines, such as at least one Translesion DNA polymerase from  E. coli , and at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase from a host other than  E. coli , for example, at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase from yeast or human or mouse. In preferred embodiments,  E. coli  Pol V or  E. coli  Pol IV are used with at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase other than  E. coli  Pol III core,  E. coli  Pol III holoenzyme, or Klenow fragment.  E. coli  Pol V or  E. coli  Pol IV may also be used in combination with at least one other Translesion DNA polymerase and with  E. coli  Pol III core,  E. coli  Pol III holoenzyme, or Klenow fragment.  \\n      The present methods are preferably carried out in aqueous solutions, preferably comprising one or more buffers and cofactors. Particularly preferred buffers for use in the present methods are the acetate, sulfate, hydrochloride, phosphate or free acid forms of Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS\u00ae), although alternative buffers of the same approximate ionic strength and pKa as TRIS\u00ae may be used with equivalent results. In addition to the buffer salts, cofactor salts such as those of potassium (preferably potassium chloride or potassium acetate) and magnesium (preferably magnesium chloride or magnesium acetate) are included in the solutions.  \\n      In another aspect, the invention includes compositions comprising at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and further comprising at least one component selected from the group consisting of: one or more non-translesion DNA polymerases, one or more reverse transcriptases, one or more nucleotides, one or more buffers, one or more primers, and one or more nucleic acid molecules. The compositions include aqueous solutions as described above, and preferably include one or more buffers as described above.  \\n      To form compositions for the present invention, one or more Translesion DNA polymerases are preferably admixed in a buffered salt solution. The compositions may also comprise one or more non-translesion DNA polymerases, which may be an exo+ or an exo\u2212 polymerase. One or more nucleotides may optionally be added to make the compositions of the invention. Optionally, one or more of the nucleotides may be modified with one or more modifications, such as with a fluorescent label, which may be same or different modifications. The compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more nucleic acid templates and/or one or more primers. More preferably, the DNA polymerases are provided at working concentrations in stable buffered salt solutions. The terms \u201cstable\u201d and \u201cstability\u201d as used herein generally mean the retention by a composition, such as an enzyme composition, of at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, and most preferably at least 90%, of the original enzymatic activity (in units) after the enzyme or composition containing the enzyme has been stored for about one week at a temperature of about 4\u00b0 C., about two to six months at a temperature of about \u221220\u00b0 C., and about six months or longer at a temperature of about \u221280\u00b0 C. As used herein, the term \u201cworking concentration\u201d means the concentration of an enzyme that is at or near the optimal concentration used in a solution to perform a particular function (such as reverse transcription of nucleic acids).  \\n      The water used in forming the compositions for the present invention is preferably distilled, deionized and sterile filtered (through a 0.1-0.2 micrometer filter), and is free of contamination by DNase and RNase enzymes. Such water is available commercially, for example from Sigma Chemical Company (Saint Louis, Mo.), or may be made as needed according to methods well known to those skilled in the art.  \\n      In addition to the enzyme components, compositions for the present invention preferably comprise one or more buffers and cofactors necessary for synthesis of a nucleic acid molecule such as a cDNA molecule. Particularly preferred buffers for use in forming the present compositions are the acetate, sulfate, hydrochloride, phosphate or free acid forms of Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS\u00ae), although alternative buffers of the same approximate ionic strength and pKa as TRIS\u00ae may be used with equivalent results. In addition to the buffer salts, cofactor salts such as those of potassium (preferably potassium chloride or potassium acetate) and magnesium (preferably magnesium chloride or magnesium acetate) are included in the compositions. Addition of one or more carbohydrates and/or sugars to the compositions and/or synthesis reaction mixtures may also be advantageous, to support enhanced stability of the compositions and/or reaction mixtures upon storage. Preferred such carbohydrates or sugars for inclusion in the compositions and/or synthesis reaction mixtures of the invention include, but are not limited to, sucrose, trehalose, and the like. Furthermore, such carbohydrates and/or sugars may be added to the storage buffers for the enzymes used in the production of the enzyme compositions and kits of the invention. Such carbohydrates and/or sugars are commercially available from a number of sources, including Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Compositions for stabilizing DNA polymerases and other enzymes are disclosed in WO 98/06736.  \\n      It is often preferable to first dissolve the buffer salts, cofactor salts and carbohydrates or sugars at working concentrations in water and to adjust the pH of the solution prior to addition of the enzymes. In this way, pH-sensitive enzymes will be less subject to acid- or alkaline-mediated inactivation during formulation of the present compositions.  \\n      To formulate the buffered salts solution, a buffer salt which is preferably a salt of Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS\u00ae), and most preferably the hydrochloride salt thereof, is combined with a sufficient quantity of water to yield a solution having a TRIS\u00ae concentration of 5-150 millimolar, preferably 10-60 millimolar, and most preferably about 20-60 millimolar. To this solution, a salt of magnesium (preferably either the chloride or acetate salt thereof) may be added to provide a working concentration thereof of 1-10 millimolar, preferably 1.5-8.0 millimolar, and most preferably about 3-7.5 millimolar. A salt of potassium (most preferably potassium chloride) may also be added to the solution, at a working concentration of 10-100 millimolar and most preferably about 20-80 millimolar. A reducing agent such as dithiothreitol may be added to the solution, preferably at a final concentration of about 0.1-20 mM, more preferably a concentration of about 0.5-10 mM, and most preferably at a concentration of about 1 mM. A small amount of a salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), such as disodium EDTA, may also be added (preferably about 0.1 millimolar). After addition of all buffers and salts, this buffered salt solution is mixed well until all salts are dissolved, and the pH is adjusted using methods known in the art to a pH value of 7.0 to 9.0, preferably 7.5 to 8.5, and most preferably about 8.0.  \\n      Polymerases are preferably used in the present methods at a final concentration in a reaction mixture of about 1-10,000 units per milliliter, about 5-5000 units per milliliter, about 10-4000 units per milliliter, about 20-3000 units per milliliter, about 30-3000 units per milliliter, about 40-2000 units per milliliter and most preferably at a concentration of about 50-1000 units per milliliter. Of course, other suitable concentrations of such polymerases suitable for use in the invention will be apparent to one or ordinary skill in the art.  \\n      Sources of Nucleic Acid Template Molecules  \\n      Using methods well known in the art, nucleic acid molecules may be prepared from a variety of sources. Preferred nucleic acid molecules for use as templates in the present invention include single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid molecule. Such nucleic acid molecules may be derived from natural or non-natural sources including single-stranded or double stranded RNA such as polyadenylated RNA (polyA+RNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules, genomic DNA, plasmid DNA, or may be synthetic. Nucleic acid templates used in the methods of the invention may comprise one or more genes, partial genes or gene fragments or any number of open reading frames (orfs).  \\n      The nucleic acid template molecules that are used to prepare mutagenized or modified molecules according to the methods of the present invention may be prepared synthetically according to standard organic chemical synthesis methods that will be familiar to one of ordinary skill. The nucleic acid template molecules may be obtained from natural sources, such as a variety of cells, tissues, organs or organisms. Cells that may be used as sources of nucleic acid molecules may be prokaryotic (bacterial cells, including those of species of the genera  Escherichia, Bacillus, Serratia, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Chlamydia, Neisseria, Treponema, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium, Helicobacter, Erwinia, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium , and  Streptomyces ) or eukaryotic (including fungi (especially yeasts), plants, protozoans and other parasites, and animals including insects (particularly  Drosophila  spp. cells), nematodes (particularly  Caenorhabditis elegans  cells), and mammals (particularly human cells)).  \\n      Mammalian somatic cells that may be used as sources of nucleic acids include blood cells (reticulocytes and leukocytes), endothelial cells, epithelial cells, neuronal cells (from the central or peripheral nervous systems), muscle cells (including myocytes and myoblasts from skeletal, smooth or cardiac muscle), connective tissue cells (including fibroblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, chondroblasts, osteocytes and osteoblasts) and other stromal cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, Schwann cells). Mammalian germ cells (spermatocytes and oocytes) may also be used as sources of nucleic acids for use in the invention, as may the progenitors, precursors and stem cells that give rise to the above somatic and germ cells. Also suitable for use as nucleic acid sources are mammalian tissues or organs such as those derived from brain, kidney, liver, pancreas, blood, bone marrow, muscle, nervous, skin, genitourinary, circulatory, lymphoid, gastrointestinal and connective tissue sources, as well as those derived from a mammalian (including human) embryo or fetus.  \\n      Any of the above prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, tissues and organs may be normal, diseased, transformed, established, progenitors, precursors, fetal or embryonic. Diseased cells may, for example, include those involved in infectious diseases (caused by bacteria, fungi or yeast, viruses (including AIDS) or parasites), in genetic or biochemical pathologies (e.g., cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, muscular dystrophy or multiple sclerosis) or in cancerous processes. Transformed or established animal cell lines may include, for example, COS cells, CHO cells, VERO cells, BHK cells, HeLa cells, HepG2 cells, K562 cells, F9 cells and the like. Other cells, cell lines, tissues, organs and organisms suitable as sources of nucleic acids for use in the present invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.  \\n      Once the starting cells, tissues, organs or other samples are obtained, nucleic acid molecules (such as mRNA) may be isolated therefrom by methods that are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Maniatis, T., et al.,  Cell  15:687-701 (1978); Okayama, H., and Berg, P.,  Mol. Cell. Biol.  2:161-170 (1982); Gubler, U., and Hoffman, B. J.,  Gene  25:263-269 (1983)). cDNA may be prepared using well-known methods such as those disclosed in WO 98/47912. Nucleic acid molecules may be cloned into vectors such as plasmids or phage (e.g., M13), and vector DNA containing the insert nucleic acid molecule may be purified using standard techniques (see, e.g., J. Sambrook, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Laboratory Press (1989)). In preferred embodiments, the Gene Trapper\u2122 system (Invitrogen Corporation) is used (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,759,778 and 5,500,356).  \\n      General methods for amplification and analysis of nucleic acid molecules or fragments are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,800,159; Innis, M. A., et al., eds.,  PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications , San Diego, Calif.: Academic Press, Inc. (1990); Griffin, H. G., and Griffin, A. M., eds.,  PCR Technology: Current Innovations , Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press (1994); PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification ed. H A Erlich, Stockton Press, New York, N.Y. (1989);  PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications , eds. Innis, Gelfland, Snisky, and White, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990); Mattila et al.,  Nucleic Acids Res.  19: 4967(1991); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A.,  PCR Methods and Applications  1:17(1991)). For example, amplification methods include PCR (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA; U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166; EP 0 684 315), and Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA; U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,818; EP 0 329 822). Oligonucleotides can be synthesized on an Applied Bio Systems oligonucleotide synthesizer according to specifications provided by the manufacturer.  \\n      Typically, the methods of the invention are carried out using one nucleic acid template. For example, the template may be a previously isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding an industrial enzyme. However, the mutagenesis methods of the invention may also be carried out using more than one nucleic acid template, such as a library or population of nucleic acids. Likewise, the methods for synthesizing a modified nucleic acid molecule may use one or more nucleic acid templates, such as a previously isolated clone or a library of clones. Previously isolated nucleic acids may be amplified from sources such as those above using standard techniques and cloned into a suitable vector for use as template in the present methods. Previously isolated nucleic acids may also be subcloned into a suitable vector using standard restriction endonuclease techniques. Template is preferably single-stranded for use with a mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerase. A preferred method of creating single-stranded template is the GeneTrapper\u2122 system (Invitrogen Corporation) for nucleic acids cloned in a vector containing an F1 origin of replication. Of course, other techniques of nucleic acid synthesis for preparing single or double-stranded template for use in the present methods will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.  \\n      As discussed, the invention provides methods of incorporating one or more random mutations into a nucleic acid template and also provides methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. To carry out the methods of invention, DNA amplification or synthesis is carried out using at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and one or more template nucleic acid molecules. The amplification or synthesis may be one or several rounds. For example, the reverse transcription and mutagenesis reactions may be carried out simultaneously (i.e., in one step) or may be carried our sequentially (i.e., two steps). For methods using mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerases, a single round of amplification or synthesis is preferably used. In random mutagenesis methods, mutagenized nucleic acids thus produced may optionally be amplified further by standard PCR using any thermophilic Translesion DNA polymerase or thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerase, as described more fully below.  \\n      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a well known DNA amplification technique, is a process by which DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are used to amplify a target DNA template. In such PCR reactions, two primers, one complementary to the 3\u2032 termini (or near the 3\u2032-termini) of the first strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified, and a second primer complementary to the 3\u2032 termini (or near the 3\u2032-termini) of the second strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified, are hybridized to their respective DNA molecules. After hybridization, DNA polymerase, in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, allows the synthesis of a third DNA molecule complementary to the first strand and a fourth DNA molecule complementary to the second strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified. This synthesis results in two double stranded DNA molecules. Such double stranded DNA molecules may then be used as DNA templates for synthesis of additional DNA molecules by providing a DNA polymerase, primers, and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. As is well known, the additional synthesis is carried out by \u201ccycling\u201d the original reaction (with excess primers and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates) allowing multiple denaturing and synthesis steps. Typically, denaturing of double stranded DNA molecules to form single stranded DNA templates is accomplished by high temperatures, although it may be accomplished by applying voltage or by other means (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,508). The thermophilic DNA polymerases (both Translesion DNA polymerases and non-translesion DNA polymerases) used in the present methods are heat stable, and thus will survive such thermal cycling during DNA amplification reactions.  \\n      For amplification of long nucleic acid molecules (i.e., greater than about 3-5 Kb in length), the compositions of the invention may comprise a combination of polypeptides having DNA polymerase activity, as described in detail in commonly owned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/801,720, filed Feb. 14, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.  \\n      Amplification or synthesis for the methods of the invention may comprise one or more steps. For example, the invention provides a method for random mutagenesis comprising (a) mixing at least one nucleic acid template with one or more of the above-described Translesion DNA polymerases to form a mixture; and (b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to amplify or synthesize or produce one or more nucleic acid molecules complementary to all or a portion of said at least one template. The invention also provides a method for modifying a nucleic acid comprising (a) mixing at least one nucleic acid template with one or more of the above-described Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more modified nucleotides to form a mixture; and (b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to amplify or synthesize or produce one or more nucleic acid molecules complementary to all or a portion of said at least one template.  \\n      For methods using more than one Translesion DNA polymerase, the enzymes may be used simultaneously or sequentially. For methods using one or more thermophilic Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerases, the enzymes may be mixed with the template prior to cycling.  \\n      For methods using one or more mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerases, the enzymes may be added simultaneously or sequentially. For example, the mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes may be mixed with the template simultaneously, the first round of amplification carried out at a moderate temperature (such as less then 40\u00b0 C.), and the subsequent rounds of PCR reactions carried out by thermal cycling. Alternatively, the mesophilic enzyme is mixed with the template, the first round of amplification is carried out at a moderate temperature, after which the thermophilic enzyme is added, and subsequent rounds of amplification are then carried out.  \\n      The invention also provides nucleic acid molecules mutagenized or modified by such methods. The invention further provides host cells comprising the present mutagenized nucleic acid molecules, and polypeptides encoded by the present mutagenized nucleic acid molecules.  \\n      Modified nucleic acid molecules produced by the present methods may be purified or may be used directly to detect or analyze nucleic acids of interest by above-mentioned methods and other methods well known in the art.  \\n      The present random mutagenesis methods produce a population of mutagenized nucleic acids, which may be isolated for further characterization and use. This may be accomplished by separation of the nucleic acid by size or by any physical or biochemical means including gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, chromatography (including sizing, affinity and immunochromatography), density gradient centrifugation and immunoadsorption, optionally after endonuclease digestion, PCR amplification, or other enzymatic manipulation. Separation of nucleic acids by gel electrophoresis is particularly preferred, as it provides a rapid and highly reproducible means of sensitive separation of a multitude of nucleic acid fragments, and permits direct, simultaneous comparison of the fragments in several samples of nucleic acids.  \\n      The isolated unique nucleic acid fragments or generally any of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be inserted into standard vectors, including expression vectors, suitable for transfection or transformation of a variety of prokaryotic (bacterial) or eukaryotic (yeast, plant or animal including human and other mammalian) cells. Alternatively, nucleic acid molecules that are mutagenized using the methods of the present invention may be further characterized, for example by sequencing (i.e., determining the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid fragments), by methods described below and others that are standard in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,962,022 and 5,498,523, which are directed to methods of DNA sequencing).  \\n      After cloning, the mutangenized nucleic acids are then screened to identify individuals encoding proteins or polypeptides having new or altered activities such as enzymatic activities, stability, ligand-binding, receptor-binding, antigen-binding affinity, therapeutic efficacy, teratogenicity, etc. The selection of an assay will be dictated by the activity being screened and will be apparent to the artisan of ordinary skill. For example, ELISAs may be performed to assay for antibody-binding activity. Once a mutagenized nucleic acid is identified that encodes a new or altered gene product that exhibits the desired activity, it may be isolated for further characterization or use.  \\n      Vectors and Host Cells  \\n      The present invention also relates to vectors which comprise the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and methods for the production of a recombinant polypeptide using these vectors and host cells.  \\n      The vector used in the present invention may be, for example, a phage or a plasmid, and is preferably a plasmid. Preferred are vectors comprising cis-acting control regions to the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide of interest. Appropriate trans-acting factors may be supplied by the host, supplied by a complementing vector or supplied by the vector itself upon introduction into the host.  \\n      In certain preferred embodiments in this regard, the vectors provide for specific expression of a polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid molecules of the invention; such expression vectors may be inducible and/or cell type-specific. Particularly preferred among such vectors are those inducible by environmental factors that are easy to manipulate, such as temperature and nutrient additives.  \\n      Expression vectors useful in the present invention include chromosomal-, episomal- and virus-derived vectors, e.g., vectors derived from bacterial plasmids or bacteriophages, and vectors derived from combinations thereof, such as cosmids and phagemids.  \\n      The nucleic acid insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda P L  promoter, the  E. coli  lac, trp and tac promoters. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The gene fusion constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiation codon at the beginning, and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end, of the polynucleotide to be translated.  \\n      The expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in  E. coli  and other bacteria.  \\n      Among vectors preferred for use in the present invention include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from Qiagen; pBS vectors, Phagescript vectors, Bluescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene; pcDNA3 available from Invitrogen Corporation; and pGEX, pTrxfus, pTrc99a, pET-5, pET-9, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.  \\n      Representative examples of appropriate host cells include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells such as  E. coli, Streptomyces  spp.,  Erwinia  spp.,  Klebsiella  spp. and  Salmonella typhimurium . Preferred as a host cell is  E. coli , and particularly preferred are  E. coli  strains DH10B and Stb12, which are available commercially (Life Technologies Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.).  \\n      Additional expression vectors and host cells may be preferred for screening mutagenized nucleic acids and their encoded proteins for particular new or altered activities. Such expression vectors and host cells will be apparent to the artisan of ordinary skill.  \\n      Peptide Production  \\n      As noted above, the methods of the present invention are suitable for production of any polypeptide of any length, via insertion of the above-described nucleic acid molecules or vectors into a host cell and expression of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest by the host cell. Introduction of the nucleic acid molecules or vectors into a host cell to produce a transformed host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al.,  Basic Methods In Molecular Biology  (1986). Expression of polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may also be accomplished by in vitro transcription/translation systems.  \\n      Once transformed host cells have been obtained, the cells may be cultivated under any physiologically compatible conditions of pH and temperature, in any suitable nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and essential minerals that support host cell growth. Recombinant polypeptide-producing cultivation conditions will vary according to the type of vector used to transform the host cells. For example, certain expression vectors comprise regulatory regions which require cell growth at certain temperatures, or addition of certain chemicals or inducing agents to the cell growth medium, to initiate the gene expression resulting in the production of the recombinant polypeptide. Thus, the term \u201crecombinant polypeptide-producing conditions,\u201d as used herein, is not meant to be limited to any one set of cultivation conditions. Appropriate culture media and conditions for the above-described host cells and vectors are well-known in the art.  \\n      Following its production in the host cells, the polypeptide of interest may be isolated by several techniques. To liberate the polypeptide of interest from the host cells, the cells are lysed or ruptured. This lysis may be accomplished by contacting the cells with a hypotonic solution, by treatment with a cell wall-disrupting enzyme such as lysozyme, by sonication, by treatment with high pressure, or by a combination of the above methods. Other methods of bacterial cell disruption and lysis that are known to one of ordinary skill may also be used.  \\n      Following disruption, the polypeptide may be separated from the cellular debris by any technique suitable for separation of particles in complex mixtures. The polypeptide may then be purified by well known isolation techniques. Suitable techniques for purification include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, electrophoresis, immunoadsorption, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography (LC), high performance LC (HPLC), fast performance LC (FPLC), hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography.  \\n      Kits  \\n      The present invention also provides kits for use in the mutagenesis or modification (e.g., labeling) of a nucleic acid molecule. Mutagenesis kits and nucleic acids modification kits according to the present invention comprise a carrier means, such as a box, carton, tube or the like, having in close confinement therein one or more container means, such as vials, tubes, ampules, bottles and the like. In one aspect, a first container means contains a stable composition comprising a mixture of reagents, at working concentrations, which are at least one Translesion DNA polymerase, at least one buffer salt, and at least one deoxynucleoside triphosphate.  \\n      For mutagenesis, the kits of the invention may comprise one or more of the following components: (i) one or more Translesion DNA polymerases, (ii) one or more non-translesion DNA polymerase, (iii) one or more suitable buffers, (iv) one or more nucleotides, and (v) one or more primers.  \\n      For synthesizing modified nucleic acids, the kits of the invention may comprise one or more of the following components: (i) one or more Translesion DNA polymerases, (ii) one or more non-translesion polymerase, (iii) one or more suitable buffers, (iv) one or more nucleotides, (v) one or more modified nucleotides, and (vi) one or more primers.  \\n      The kits may further comprise additional reagents and compounds necessary for carrying out standard nucleic synthesis protocols (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202, which are directed to methods of DNA amplification by PCR; WO 007 1559, directed to methods of producing improved primers, WO 98/06736, directed to stable compositions of DNA polymerases).  \\n      The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA and immunology, which are within the capabilities of a person of ordinary skill in the art. Such techniques are explained in the literature. See, e.g., J. Sambrook, et al.,  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Second Edition, Books 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989); B.

Field of the Invention </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\"> The present invention is in the fields of molecular biology and protein chemistry. The invention is related generally to methods of synthesizing or amplifying (copying) nucleic acids using one or more Translesion DNA polymerases. In some aspects, the methods are directed to introducing a random mutation into a nucleic acid and/or to introducing a random mutation into an encoded polypeptide. In other aspects, the methods are directed to introducing a modified nucleotide into a nucleic acid. In further aspects, the methods comprise use of at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and, optionally, at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase. The methods also comprise use of at least two Translesion DNA polymerases and optionally, at least one non-translesion DNA polymerase. The invention also relates to mutagenized and/or modified nucleic acid molecules produced by these methods, and to fragments or derivatives thereof. The invention also relates to vectors and host cells comprising such mutagenized and/or modified nucleic acid molecules, fragments, or derivatives.

Related Art </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\"> DNA Amplification </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\"> In order to increase the copy number of, or \u201camplify,\u201d specific sequences of DNA in a sample, investigators have relied on a number of amplification techniques. A commonly used amplification technique is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) method described by Mullis and colleagues (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,800,159). This method uses \u201cprimer\u201d sequences which are complementary to opposing regions on the DNA sequence to be amplified. These primers are added to the DNA target sample, along with a molar excess of nucleotide bases and a DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase), and the primers bind to their target via base-specific binding interactions (i.e., adenine binds to thymine, cytosine to guanine). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\"> If the target polynucleotide contains two strands, it may be necessary to separate the strands of the nucleic acid before it can be used as the template, either as a separate step or simultaneously with the synthesis of the primer extension products. This strand separation can be accomplished by any suitable denaturing method including physical, chemical or enzymatic means. One physical method of separating the strands of the polynucleotide involves heating the polynucleotide until it is substantially denatured. Strand separation may also be induced by an enzyme from the class of enzymes known as helicases or the enzyme RecA, which has helicase activity and in the presence of rATP is known to denature DNA. The reaction conditions suitable for separating the strands of polynucleotides with helicases are described by Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology, Vol. XLIII \u201cDNA: Replication and Recombination\u201d (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1978), B. Kuhn et al., \u201cDNA Helicases\u201d, pp. 63-67, and techniques for using RecA are reviewed in C. Radding, Ann. Rev. Genetics, 16:405-37 (1982). Strand separation may also be performed by applying a voltage (U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,508). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\"> Other techniques for amplification of target nucleic acid sequences have also been developed. For example, Walker et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166; EP 0 684 315) described a method called Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), which differs from PCR in that it operates at a single temperature and uses a polymerase/endonuclease combination of enzymes to generate single-stranded fragments of the target DNA sequence, which then serve as templates for the production of complementary DNA (cDNA) strands. An alternative amplification procedure, termed Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA) was disclosed by Davey et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,818; EP 0 329 822). Similar to SDA, NASBA employs an isothermal reaction, but is based on the use of RNA primers for amplification rather than DNA primers as in PCR or SDA. Another known amplification procedure includes Promoter Ligation Activated Transcriptase (LAT) described by Berninger et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,370). Single primer amplification provides for the amplification of a template that possesses a stem-loop or inverted repeat structure where the template is flanked by relatively short complementary sequences. U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,584 discloses a method wherein single stranded DNA can be generated by the polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotide primers, one present in a limiting concentration. U.S. Pat. No. 5,340,728 discloses an improved method for performing a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a targeted piece of DNA, wherein by controlling the annealing times and concentration of both the outer and the inner set of primers according to the method disclosed, highly specific and efficient amplification of a targeted piece of DNA can be achieved without depletion or removal of the outer primers from the reaction mixture vessel. U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,632 discloses recombination PCR (RPCR) wherein PCR is used with at least two primer species to add double-stranded homologous ends to DNA such that the homologous ends undergo in vivo recombination following transfection of host cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\"> Horton et al. (1989) Gene 77:61, discloses a method for making chimeric genes using PCR to generate overlapping homologous regions. Silver and Keerikatte (1989) <i>J. Virol. </i>63:1924 describe another variation of the standard PCR approach (which requires oligonucleotide primers complementary to both ends of the segment to be amplified) to allow amplification of DNA flanked on only one side by a region of known DNA sequence. Triglia et al. (1988) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>16:8186, describe an approach which requires the inversion of the sequence of interest by circularization and re-opening at a site distinct from the one of interest, and is called \u201cinverted PCR.\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,905 discloses end-complementary amplification. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0005\" num=\"0000\"> Random Mutagenesis </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\"> Random mutagenesis is used to introduce random changes into polynucleotides and encoded proteins (Miller et al., (1992) A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics, CSHL Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; and Greener et al., (1994) Strategies in <i>Mol Biol </i>7:32-34) and is used in directed evolution strategies. Random mutagenesis and other directed evolution strategies have advantages over rational design methods by, for example, allowing one to change or optimize a biological molecule in contexts not found in nature. Random mutagenesis is also used in structure-function studies and has the advantage over reverse genetic techniques of allowing one to carry out structure-function studies without making assumptions regarding which regions of a molecule may be essential or dispensable to a particular activity. Further, random mutagenesis can potentially greatly reduce the time and effort needed to generate a large number of progeny for either directed evolution or structure-function studies over current techniques. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\"> More recent methods of random mutagenesis rely on error-prone DNA polymerases. Using these polymerases, randomized (mutagenized) DNA is produced and cloned into expression vectors, and the resulting mutant libraries are screened for activity such as enzymatic or binding activity. The level of desired mutation frequency varies with the application. For example, to analyze protein structure-function relationships, one amino acid change per gene is desired (1-2 base changes per 1000 nucleotides). In directed evolution strategies, mutation frequencies of 1-4 amino acid changes per gene (2-7 nucleotide changes) are desired (Wan, L., et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>9.5:12825-12831 (1998); Cherry, J. R., et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>17:379-384 (1999)). Some strategies involve highly mutagenized libraries containing 20 point mutations per gene (Daugherty, P. S., et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>97:2029-2034 (2000)). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\"> Up to the present, DNA polymerases were not available with mutation frequencies high enough to generate the required number of mutations per gene during a single round of copying a gene. Protocols were developed to force misincorporation by the use of nucleotide concentration imbalance during a single round of DNA synthesis (Liao, X. and Wise J. A., <i>Gene </i>88:107-111 (1990)), but the rate of mutation and distribution of mutation type were difficult to control. To address the issues of introducing a sufficiently high number of mutations in a gene while maintaining some control over the number of mutations actually introduced, PCR random mutagenesis with pol Taq was developed (Leung, D. W., et al., <i>Technique </i>1:11-15 (1989); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., <i>PCR Methods Applications </i>2:28-33 (1992); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in <i>PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual</i>, C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>PCR Methods Applications </i>1:17-24 (1991); Zhou, Y., et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>19:6052 (1991); Vartanian, J. P., et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>14:2627-2631 (1996); Fromant, M., et al., <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>224:347-353 (1995); Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Biochem. </i>27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>18:3739-3744 (1990); Huang, M. M., et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>20:4567-4573 (1992)). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\"> The formula f=ne/2 describes the average mutation frequency (f) for PCR amplification as a function of the polymerase error rate per nucleotide per cycle (e) and the number of cycles (n), assuming e is constant at each cycle and the polymerase makes one pass of each DNA molecule per cycle (p=pass number) (Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>PCR Methods Applications </i>1:17-24 (1991)). The frequency of DNA mutations can be controlled by altering the number of cycles (n) and/or the polymerase error rate per nucleotide incorporated (e). It is a given that the number of PCR cycles (n) is greater than or equal to the number passes (p) per cycle, n\u2267p. As the starting DNA amount is increased, the inequality between n and p increases. That is as the amount of starting DNA increases, the number of DNA molecules in a population that do not get copied during one PCR cycle also increases. So a third variable, starting DNA amount, can be used to influence p and thus the frequency of DNA mutations. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\"> Pol Taq has an average error rate (e) of 1\u00d710<sup>\u22124 </sup>(Table 1; Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Biochem. </i>27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>18:3739-3744(1990)) so that after n=20 cycles with a single pass per cycle (p=1) there would be on the average one base change in 1000 nucleotides incorporated. But the average error rate of pol Taq does not reflect its misincorporation bias, a strong tendency to misincorporate G whenever a template T is encountered (Table 1 and 3, Tindall, K. R. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Biochem. </i>27:6008-6013 (1988); Eckert, K. A. and Kunkel, T. A., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>18:3739-3744 (1990)). A library of mutants generated with pol Taq using standard PCR reaction conditions will contain predominantly transition mutations and particularly T\u2192C (Zhou, Y., et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>19:6052 (1991)). In addition, many applications require a higher mutation frequency (2-20 base changes per 1000 nucleotides). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\"> To overcome these limitations, protocols were developed that increase the error rate of pol Taq and decrease its misincorporation bias (Leung, D. W., et al., <i>Technique </i>1:11-15 (1989); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., <i>PCR Methods Applications </i>2:28-33 (1992); Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in <i>PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual</i>, C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995); Vartanian, J. P., et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>14:2627-2631 (1996); Fromant, M., et al., <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>224:347-353 (1995)). Error rate is increased by increasing the Mg++ concentration and by adding the mutagenic divalent metal ion Mn++. Misincorporation bias is reduced by manipulating the relative dNTP concentrations. However, because of the extreme sensitivity of pol Taq to changes in dNTP and Mn++ concentrations, the mutation number and type obtained in a mutant population are often not predictable or reproducible. Unbalancing the dNTP concentrations does not totally eliminate the misincorporation bias of pol Taq (Cadwell, R. C. and Joyce, G. F., Mutagenic PCR, in <i>PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual</i>, C. W. Dieffenbach and G. S. Dveksler (eds.), CSHL Press, pp. 583-589 (1995)). The modified PCR reaction conditions required frequently produce poor product yields and amplification artifacts (Id.). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\"> At least two companies now offer random mutagenesis systems, Clontech and Stratagene. Clontech sells a system called Diversify PCR Random Mutagnesis Kit. Clontech&#39;s kit relies upon the use of Mn++ and nucleotide imbalance to control the mutation frequency and bias of pol Taq. This system suffers from the disadvantages already mentioned in trying to control the mutation frequency and mutation bias of pol Taq. An interesting positive feature of Clontech&#39;s kit is the inclusion of a rapid control reaction that allows the relative comparison of mutation rates in the control DNA fragment in two hours following PCR. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\"> Stratagene sells a system called GeneMorph PCR Mutagenesis Kit. Stratagene has taken a different approach in their system. Rather than manipulating the error frequency of pol Taq, they manipulate the starting DNA concentration over 5 logs in PCR performed under one set of reaction conditions. This influences the number of mutations introduced in the final amplified DNA population as already discussed. They have also introduced the use of a new thermal stable DNA polymerase, Mutazyme\u2122, that has an error rate 5-10 times greater than pol Taq. This system suffers from the unpredictability of the number of mutations actually produced with a new DNA template at a selected concentration, and from the mutation pattern bias of Mutazyme\u2122. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0006\" num=\"0000\"> Incorporation of Modified Nucleotides </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\"> Numerous methods and systems have been developed for the detection, quantitation, and analysis of polynucleotides in drug development, diagnostics, and research. These methods are used in disease diagnosis, for example by detecting polynucleotides of infectious organisms or detecting somatic and heritable mutations, and in basic and industrial research, for example by analyzing gene expression. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\"> An expanding area of polynucleotide analysis is DNA array technology. This technology using arrays of nucleic acid probes, such as oligonucleotides, to detect complementary nucleic acid sequences in a sample nucleic acid of interest (the \u201ctarget\u201d nucleic acid). For example, an array of nucleic acid probes is fabricated at known locations on a substrate such as a chip. A labeled nucleic acid is then brought into contact with the chip and a scanner generates an image file indicating the locations where the labeled nucleic acids are bound to the chip. Based upon the image file and identities of the probes at specific locations, it becomes possible to extract information such as the expression pattern of a nucleic acid of interest (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,077). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\"> Methods using arrays of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid substrate are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,270. In this method, an array of diverse nucleic acids is formed on a substrate. The fabrication of arrays of polymers, such as nucleic acids, on a solid substrate, and methods of use of the arrays in different assays, are described in: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,203,989, 6,200,757, 6,180,351, 6,156,501, 6,083,726, 5,981,185, 5,744,101, 5,677,195, 5,624,711, 5,599,695, 5,445,934, 5,384,261, 5,571,639, 5,451,683, 5,424,186, 5,412,087, 5,384,261, 5,252,743 and 5,143,854; PCT WO 92/10092; PCT WO 93/09668; PCT WO 97/10365. Improved methods for minimizing the effects of random or systematic errors in array technology are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,223,127. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\"> Accessing genetic information using high density DNA arrays is further described in Chee, <i>Science </i>274:610-614 (1996). The combination of photolithographic and fabrication techniques allows each probe sequence to occupy a very small site on the support. The site may be as small as a few microns or even a small molecule. Such probe arrays may be of the type known as Very Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis (VLSIPS\u2122). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,734 and 5,143,854 and PCT patent publication Nos. WO 90/15070 and 92/10092. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\"> Typically, the existence of a nucleic acid of interest in array technology and other DNA detection methods is indicated by the presence or absence of an observable \u201clabel\u201d attached to a probe or attached to amplified sample DNA. A convenient method for incorporating a label or other modification into DNA would be to use in vitro amplification of a nucleic acid template using DNA polymerase. However, commercially available DNA polymerases are inefficient at incorporating modified nucleotides, particularly ones with bulky groups. Accordingly, there exists a need for more efficient incorporation of modified nucleotides, particularly labeled nucleotides, during amplification or synthesis of a nucleic acid template. Efficient incorporation of such nucleotides will allow for improved synthesis of labeled probes which may be used in the research market as well as in the field of diagnostics. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0007\" num=\"0000\"> Translesion DNA Polymerases </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\"> In the past few years a new superfamily of DNA polymerases has been discovered whose members function in the replication of damaged DNA (Goodman, M., <i>TIBS </i>25:189-195 (2000); Hubscher, U., et al., <i>TIBS </i>25:143-147 (2000); Goodman, M.

L., <i>Cell </i>98:413-416 (1999); Johnson, R. E., et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:12224-12226 (1999); Baynton, K. and Fuchs, R. P. P., <i>TIBS </i>25:74-79 (2000); Friedberg, E.

Sci. </i>356:53-60 (2001)). The superfamily is called UmuC/DinB/Rad30/Rcv1 after the four prototypic genes that define the subfamilies within this superfamily (see below). This superfamily will be referred to herein as the Translesion Superfamily of DNA polymerases, and includes <i>E. coli </i>pol IV and pol V, and eukaryotic pol \u03b6 (zeta), \u03b7 (eta), \u03b9 (iota), \u03ba (kappa), and \u03b8 (theta). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\"> Previously identified DNA polymerase superfamilies include the A, B, C, and X Superfamilies. These superfamilies include, for example, (A) <i>E. coli </i>pol I, pol T7, pol T5, pol Taq, pol Tth, pol Tne, reverse transcriptases, and eukaryotic pol \u03b3 (gamma); (B) <i>E. coli </i>pol II, eukaryotic pol \u03b1 (alpha), eukaryotic \u03b4 (delta), eukaryotic \u03b5 (epsilon), pol T4, pol \u03a629, pol Pfu, and pol KOD (Pfx); (C) <i>E. coli </i>pol III \u03b1 subunit; and (X) eukaryotic pol \u03b2 (beta), eukaryotic \u03bb (lambda), eukaryotic \u03bc (mu), and TdT. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\"> Pol III holoenzyme is a member of the C Superfamily of DNA polymerases. It represents the typical genome replicative DNA polymerase with high fidelity (exo+; contains proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity), high processivity (once bound to a template-primer it remains bound through many polymerization events), and minimal ability to bypass lesions in DNA. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\"> The Translesion Superfamily members have several unusual characteristics that set them apart from other DNA polymerases. For example, these DNA polymerases are highly error prone (Table 1). A typical replicative DNA polymerase, such as <i>E. coli </i>pol III holoenzyme, has an error rate (mutations introduced/nucleotide incorporated) of about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22126 </sup>(Matsuda, T. et al. <i>Nature </i>404: 1011-1013 (2000)). Enzymes previously thought to be error prone include two retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) and pol Taq, whose error rates are 0.5-1\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>. Notably, members of the Translesion Superfamily, pol \u03ba (kappa) and pol \u03b7 (eta) in particular, have error rates of 2-4\u00d710<sup>\u22122 </sup>(Table 1). Thus, they make an error once in every 25 to 50 nucleotides incorporated. A third member, pol \u03b9, actually violates Watson-Crick base-pairing rules in its nucleotide incorporation preferences (Table 2).  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00001\" num=\"1\"> <patent-tables

of DNA polymerases have several additional properties of interest. First, they are nonprocessive; that is, they dissociate from template-primer after almost every nucleotide incorporation event. Second, the mutation frequency spectra of the Translesion enzymes, particularly pol \u03ba and pol \u03b7, are much more uniform than that of pol Taq, the DNA polymerase presently used to generate random mutations (Table 3). Therefore, mutations introduced by pol \u03ba or pol \u03b7, for example, will have a much-reduced bias towards a particular type. Third, they also lack proofreading 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity.  \\n<tables id=\"TABLE-US-00003\" num=\"3\"> <patent-tables frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" pgwide=\"1\"> <tgroup

Pol V has low processivity, dissociating after incorporation of 6 to 8 nucleotides under the best of conditions and is distributive in the absence of accessory proteins (Tang, M., et al., <i>Nature </i>404:1014-1018 (2000)). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\"> Pol V requires RecA*, \u03b2 processivity clamp, \u03b3 clamp-loading complex (5 proteins), and ssb to carry out efficient copying of DNA (Pham, P., et al., <i>Nature </i>409:366-370 (2001)).

Pol IV base substitution errors are biased towards a G substitution for another base and most often occur at the sequence 5\u2032-GX-3\u2032 where X represents the base (T, A, or C) that is mutated to G (Tang, M., et al., <i>Nature </i>404:1014-1018 (2000); Wagner, J. and Nohmi, T., <i>J.

The methods of the present invention relate generally to methods of synthesizing or amplifying nucleic acid molecules using one or more Translesion DNA polymerases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\"> In one aspect, the invention relates to kits and methods and compositions for incorporating random mutations or changes (preferably randomly) in DNA molecules. In this aspect, one or more template nucleic acid molecules and at least one Translesion DNA polymerase are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule (which may be complementary to all or a portion of said one or more of said templates). Such conditions generally require at least one primer and one or more nucleotides (e.g., dNTPs), and may also require buffers, salts and/or accessory proteins. A Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates at least one mutation (which may be one or more deletions, substitutions and insertions or combinations thereof of one or more nucleotides) in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be performed to incorporate any number of such mutations which are preferably random mutations. One or more non-translesion DNA polymerases may also be used in the present methods. The resulting complementary nucleic acid molecules (mutagenized nucleic acid molecules) may be further amplified using standard amplification techniques such as PCR. More than one Translesion DNA polymerase (which may be the same or different) and more than one non-translesion DNA polymerase (which may be the same or different) may be used. Such polymerases may be mesophilic or thermophilic. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\"> In a preferred aspect, one or more mismatch nucleotides are added to the nucleic acid molecule made by the methods of the invention to produce one or a population of randomly mutagenized nucleic acid molecules and such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be used to produce one or a population of polypeptides or proteins having any number of changes in amino acid sequences. Preferably, one or more amino acid substitutions are created in such polypeptides, although other types of changes or combination or changes in amino acid sequence can take place including one or more deletion of amino acids, and one or more insertions of amino acids. Thus, the invention provides methods and requests capable of producing one or more and preferably populations of mutagenized nucleic acid molecules (which may comprise any number of substitution, insertion and/or deletion mutations) and such nucleic acid molecules may be used to produce mutagenized polypeptides or proteins. Such proteins or populations of proteins may then be analyzed for desired functional or activity changes using well known techniques and functional or activity assays. Proteins or polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be produced by expression of the nucleic acid molecules in a host cell or by using in vitro transcription/translation systems known in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\"> The invention further provides mutagenized nucleic acids produced by the above-described methods and host cells comprising mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention. Such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Mutagenized nucleic acids are useful for structure-function studies and for optimizing encoded mRNA and polypeptides. Such molecules, especially polypeptides, can be assayed for improved enzymatic activities, receptor properties, ligand interactions, antibiotic or antiviral properties, vaccine efficacy, or antibody binding affinity. The invention also provides polypeptides encoded by the mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\"> In another aspect, the present invention relates to kits and methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. In this aspect, one or more template nucleic acid molecules, at least one Translesion DNA polymerase, and one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different) are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule (which may be complementary to all or a portion of said one or more of said templates). Such conditions generally require at least one primer and one or more nucleotides (e.g., dNTPs), and may also require buffers, salts and/or accessory proteins. The Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates the one or more (which may be the same or different) modified nucleotides in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be used. More than one Translesion DNA polymerase and more than one non-translesion DNA polymerase may be used. Such polymerases may be mesophilic or thermophilic. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\"> The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules produced according to the above-described methods. Such modified nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded and may comprise any number of the same or different modified nucleotides. Modified nucleic acid molecules include labeled nucleic acid molecules and are useful as detection probes. Depending on the modified nucleotide(s) used during synthesis, the modified molecules may contain one or a number of modifications. Where multiple modifications are used, the molecules may comprise a number of the same or different modifications such as labels. Thus, one type or multiple different modified nucleotides may be used during synthesis of nucleic acid molecules to provide for the modified nucleic acid molecules of the invention. Such modified nucleic acid molecules will thus comprise one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different). The invention also provides uses of the modified nucleic acids for analyzing samples.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0009\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic of the random mutagenesis technique using a mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerase.

The term nucleotide includes modified nucleotides. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\"> Modified Nucleotide. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\"> The term \u201cmodified nucleotide\u201d refers to a nucleotide other than dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Thus, the term modified nucleotide excludes dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The term modified nucleotide includes ddNTPs, and nucleotide derivatives such as ddNTP derivatives, dNTP derivatives, and NTP derivatives. Modified nucleotides also include labeled nucleotides. Preferred modified nucleotides include nucleotides that are bulky relative to dATP, dCTP, dUTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Many examples of modified nucleotides are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,757. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\"> Hybridization. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\"> The terms \u201chybridization\u201d and \u201chybridizing\u201d refers to base pairing of two complementary single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (RNA and/or DNA) to give a double-stranded molecule. As used herein, two nucleic acid molecules may be hybridized, although the base pairing is not completely complementary. Accordingly, mismatched bases do not prevent hybridization of two nucleic acid molecules provided that appropriate conditions, well known in the art, are used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\"> Unit. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\"> The term \u201cunit\u201d as used herein refers to the activity of an enzyme. When referring, for example, to a thermostable DNA polymerase, one unit of activity is the amount of enzyme that will incorporate 10 nanomoles of dNTPs into acid-insoluble material (i.e., DNA or RNA) in 30 minutes under standard primed DNA synthesis conditions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\"> Probes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\"> The term \u201cprobes\u201d refers to single or double stranded nucleic acid molecules or oligonucleotides which are used to detect or analyze a nucleic acid of interest. In some embodiments, a probe is unlabeled. For example, in array technology, nucleic acid probes bound to the substrate (e.g., chip) are unlabeled and the nucleic acid of interest is labeled. In other embodiments, a probe is detectably labeled by one or more detectable markers or labels. For example, in Southern and northern blot analysis, the probe is labeled and the nucleic acid of interest is unlabeled. Such labels or markers may be the same or different and may include radioactive labels, magnetic resonance labels, dye labels, fluorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, electrochemiluminescent labels (ECL), bioluminescent labels, enzyme labels, antigenic determinants detectable by an antibody, biotin labels, and digoxigenin labels (DIG), although one or more fluorescent labels (which are the same or different) are preferred in accordance with the invention. Probes have specific utility in the detection of nucleic acid molecules by hybridization and thus may be used in diagnostic assays. Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) labels are those which become luminescent species when acted on electrochemically. They provide a sensitive and precise measurement of the presence and concentration of an analyte of interest. In such techniques, the sample is exposed to a voltammetric working electrode in order to trigger luminescence. The light produced by the label is measured and indicates the presence or quantity of the analyte. Such ECL techniques are described in U.S. Pat.

DNA polymerases synthesize the formation of a DNA molecule complementary to a single-stranded DNA template by extending a primer in the 5\u2032-3\u2032-direction. This activity for mesophilic DNA polymerases may be inactivated by heat treatment. For example, T5 DNA polymerase activity is totally inactivated by exposing the enzyme to a temperature of 90\u00b0 C. for 30 seconds. As used herein, a thermostable DNA polymerase activity is more resistant to heat inactivation than a mesophilic DNA polymerase. However, a thermostable DNA polymerase does not mean to refer to an enzyme which is totally resistant to heat inactivation and thus heat treatment may reduce the DNA polymerase activity to some extent. A thermostable DNA polymerase typically will also have a higher optimum temperature than mesophilic DNA polymerases. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\"> 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 Exonuclease Activity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\"> \u201c3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease activity\u201d is an enzymatic activity well known to the art.

A unit of activity of 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease is defined as the amount of activity that solubilizes 10 nmoles of substrate ends in 60 min. at 37\u00b0 C., assayed as described in the \u201cBRL 1989 Catalogue &amp; Reference Guide\u201d, page 5, with HhaI fragments of lambda DNA 3\u2032-end labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]dTTP by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Protein is measured by the method of Brandford, Anal. Biochem. 72:248 (1976). As a means of comparison, natural, wild-type T5-DNA polymerase (DNAP) or T5-DNAP encoded by pTTQ19-T5-2 has a specific activity of about 10 units/mg protein while the DNA polymerase encoded by pTTQ19-T5-2(Exo-) (U.S. Pat.

The present invention achieves previously unattainable mutation frequencies of 2 to 20 base pairs per 1,000 nucleotides in one round of mutagenesis. The invention also facilitates the production of modified, e.g., labeled, nucleic acid molecules not heretofore possible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\"> Mutagenesis. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\"> The methods of the present invention relate generally to methods of synthesizing and/or amplifying nucleic acid molecules. In one aspect, the invention relates to kits and methods for incorporating mutations, preferably randomly, in DNA molecules. In this aspect, a template nucleic acid molecule and a Translesion DNA polymerase are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule. Such conditions generally require at least one primer and dNTPs, and may also require salts and/or accessory proteins. A Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates at least one random mutation in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be performed to incorporate random mutations. The mutation rate may be altered up or down by including Translesion DNA polymerases and non-translesion DNA polymerases with various misincorporation rates in the method. The resulting complementary nucleic acid molecules or population of nucleic acid molecules (mutagenized nucleic acid molecules) may be further amplified using standard amplification techniques such as PCR. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\"> The invention further provides mutagenized nucleic acids produced by the methods of the invention. Such mutagenized nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Mutagenized nucleic acids are useful for structure-function studies and for optimizing encoded mRNA and polypeptides. Such molecules, especially polypeptides, can be assayed for improved enzymatic activities, receptor properties, ligand interactions, antibiotic or antiviral properties, vaccine efficacy, or antibody binding affinity. The invention also provides polypeptides encoded by the mutagenized nucleic acids of the invention. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\"> Modified Polynucleotides. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\"> In another aspect, the present invention relates to kits and methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. In this aspect, a template nucleic acid molecule, a Translesion DNA polymerase, and a modified nucleotide are incubated under conditions sufficient to allow synthesis of a complementary nucleic acid molecule. Such conditions generally require at least one primer and dNTPs, and may also require salts and/or accessory proteins. The Translesion DNA polymerase incorporates the modified nucleotide in the complementary nucleic acid molecule. One or more rounds of synthesis may be used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\"> In accordance with the invention, the amount of modified, e.g., labeled, product is preferably measured based on percent incorporation of the modification of interest into synthesized product as may be determined by one skilled in the art, although other means of measuring the amount or efficiency of modification will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. The invention provides for enhanced or increased percent incorporation of modified nucleotide during synthesis of a nucleic acid molecule from a template </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0136\"> The invention also provides modified nucleic acid molecules produced according to the above-described methods. Such modified nucleic acid molecules may be single or double stranded. Modified nucleic acid molecules include labeled nucleic acid molecules and are useful as detection probes. Depending on the modified nucleotide(s) used during synthesis, the modified molecules may contain one or a number of modifications. Where multiple modifications are used, the molecules may comprise a number of the same or different modifications such as labels. Thus, one type or multiple different modified nucleotides may be used during synthesis of nucleic acid molecules to provide for the modified nucleic acid molecules of the invention. Such modified nucleic acid molecules will thus comprise one or more modified nucleotides (which may be the same or different). </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0013\" num=\"0000\"> DNA Polymerases </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\"> A variety of Translesion DNA polymerases may be used in the present methods.

Nos. 5,759,778 and 5,500,356). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\"> General methods for amplification and analysis of nucleic acid molecules or fragments are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,800,159; Innis, M. A., et al., eds., <i>PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications</i>, San Diego, Calif.: Academic Press, Inc. (1990); Griffin, H.

For example, amplification methods include PCR (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA; U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,166; EP 0 684 315), and Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification (NASBA; U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,818; EP 0 329 822). Oligonucleotides can be synthesized on an Applied Bio Systems oligonucleotide synthesizer according to specifications provided by the manufacturer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\"> Typically, the methods of the invention are carried out using one nucleic acid template. For example, the template may be a previously isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding an industrial enzyme. However, the mutagenesis methods of the invention may also be carried out using more than one nucleic acid template, such as a library or population of nucleic acids. Likewise, the methods for synthesizing a modified nucleic acid molecule may use one or more nucleic acid templates, such as a previously isolated clone or a library of clones. Previously isolated nucleic acids may be amplified from sources such as those above using standard techniques and cloned into a suitable vector for use as template in the present methods. Previously isolated nucleic acids may also be subcloned into a suitable vector using standard restriction endonuclease techniques. Template is preferably single-stranded for use with a mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerase. A preferred method of creating single-stranded template is the GeneTrapper\u2122 system (Invitrogen Corporation) for nucleic acids cloned in a vector containing an F1 origin of replication. Of course, other techniques of nucleic acid synthesis for preparing single or double-stranded template for use in the present methods will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\"> As discussed, the invention provides methods of incorporating one or more random mutations into a nucleic acid template and also provides methods of synthesizing modified nucleic acid molecules. To carry out the methods of invention, DNA amplification or synthesis is carried out using at least one Translesion DNA polymerase and one or more template nucleic acid molecules. The amplification or synthesis may be one or several rounds. For example, the reverse transcription and mutagenesis reactions may be carried out simultaneously (i.e., in one step) or may be carried our sequentially (i.e., two steps). For methods using mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerases, a single round of amplification or synthesis is preferably used. In random mutagenesis methods, mutagenized nucleic acids thus produced may optionally be amplified further by standard PCR using any thermophilic Translesion DNA polymerase or thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerase, as described more fully below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\"> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a well known DNA amplification technique, is a process by which DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are used to amplify a target DNA template. In such PCR reactions, two primers, one complementary to the 3\u2032 termini (or near the 3\u2032-termini) of the first strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified, and a second primer complementary to the 3\u2032 termini (or near the 3\u2032-termini) of the second strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified, are hybridized to their respective DNA molecules. After hybridization, DNA polymerase, in the presence of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, allows the synthesis of a third DNA molecule complementary to the first strand and a fourth DNA molecule complementary to the second strand of the DNA molecule to be amplified. This synthesis results in two double stranded DNA molecules. Such double stranded DNA molecules may then be used as DNA templates for synthesis of additional DNA molecules by providing a DNA polymerase, primers, and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. As is well known, the additional synthesis is carried out by \u201ccycling\u201d the original reaction (with excess primers and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates) allowing multiple denaturing and synthesis steps. Typically, denaturing of double stranded DNA molecules to form single stranded DNA templates is accomplished by high temperatures, although it may be accomplished by applying voltage or by other means (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,508). The thermophilic DNA polymerases (both Translesion DNA polymerases and non-translesion DNA polymerases) used in the present methods are heat stable, and thus will survive such thermal cycling during DNA amplification reactions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\"> For amplification of long nucleic acid molecules (i.e., greater than about 3-5 Kb in length), the compositions of the invention may comprise a combination of polypeptides having DNA polymerase activity, as described in detail in commonly owned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/801,720, filed Feb. 14, 1997, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\"> Amplification or synthesis for the methods of the invention may comprise one or more steps. For example, the invention provides a method for random mutagenesis comprising (a) mixing at least one nucleic acid template with one or more of the above-described Translesion DNA polymerases to form a mixture; and (b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to amplify or synthesize or produce one or more nucleic acid molecules complementary to all or a portion of said at least one template. The invention also provides a method for modifying a nucleic acid comprising (a) mixing at least one nucleic acid template with one or more of the above-described Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more modified nucleotides to form a mixture; and (b) incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to amplify or synthesize or produce one or more nucleic acid molecules complementary to all or a portion of said at least one template. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\"> For methods using more than one Translesion DNA polymerase, the enzymes may be used simultaneously or sequentially. For methods using one or more thermophilic Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerases, the enzymes may be mixed with the template prior to cycling. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0189\"> For methods using one or more mesophilic Translesion DNA polymerases and one or more thermophilic non-translesion DNA polymerases, the enzymes may be added simultaneously or sequentially. For example, the mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes may be mixed with the template simultaneously, the first round of amplification carried out at a moderate temperature (such as less then 40\u00b0 C.), and the subsequent rounds of PCR reactions carried out by thermal cycling. Alternatively, the mesophilic enzyme is mixed with the template, the first round of amplification is carried out at a moderate temperature, after which the thermophilic enzyme is added, and subsequent rounds of amplification are then carried out. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0190\"> The invention also provides nucleic acid molecules mutagenized or modified by such methods. The invention further provides host cells comprising the present mutagenized nucleic acid molecules, and polypeptides encoded by the present mutagenized nucleic acid molecules. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0191\"> Modified nucleic acid molecules produced by the present methods may be purified or may be used directly to detect or analyze nucleic acids of interest by above-mentioned methods and other methods well known in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0192\"> The present random mutagenesis methods produce a population of mutagenized nucleic acids, which may be isolated for further characterization and use. This may be accomplished by separation of the nucleic acid by size or by any physical or biochemical means including gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, chromatography (including sizing, affinity and immunochromatography), density gradient centrifugation and immunoadsorption, optionally after endonuclease digestion, PCR amplification, or other enzymatic manipulation. Separation of nucleic acids by gel electrophoresis is particularly preferred, as it provides a rapid and highly reproducible means of sensitive separation of a multitude of nucleic acid fragments, and permits direct, simultaneous comparison of the fragments in several samples of nucleic acids. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0193\"> The isolated unique nucleic acid fragments or generally any of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be inserted into standard vectors, including expression vectors, suitable for transfection or transformation of a variety of prokaryotic (bacterial) or eukaryotic (yeast, plant or animal including human and other mammalian) cells. Alternatively, nucleic acid molecules that are mutagenized using the methods of the present invention may be further characterized, for example by sequencing (i.e., determining the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid fragments), by methods described below and others that are standard in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,962,022 and 5,498,523, which are directed to methods of DNA sequencing). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0195\" num=\"0194\"> After cloning, the mutangenized nucleic acids are then screened to identify individuals encoding proteins or polypeptides having new or altered activities such as enzymatic activities, stability, ligand-binding, receptor-binding, antigen-binding affinity, therapeutic efficacy, teratogenicity, etc. The selection of an assay will be dictated by the activity being screened and will be apparent to the artisan of ordinary skill. For example, ELISAs may be performed to assay for antibody-binding activity. Once a mutagenized nucleic acid is identified that encodes a new or altered gene product that exhibits the desired activity, it may be isolated for further characterization or use. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0015\" num=\"0000\"> Vectors and Host Cells </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0196\" num=\"0195\"> The present invention also relates to vectors which comprise the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and methods for the production of a recombinant polypeptide using these vectors and host cells. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0196\"> The vector used in the present invention may be, for example, a phage or a plasmid, and is preferably a plasmid.

Preferred as a host cell is <i>E. coli</i>, and particularly preferred are <i>E. coli </i>strains DH10B and Stb12, which are available commercially (Life Technologies Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0203\"> Additional expression vectors and host cells may be preferred for screening mutagenized nucleic acids and their encoded proteins for particular new or altered activities. Such expression vectors and host cells will be apparent to the artisan of ordinary skill. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0016\" num=\"0000\"> Peptide Production </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0204\"> As noted above, the methods of the present invention are suitable for production of any polypeptide of any length, via insertion of the above-described nucleic acid molecules or vectors into a host cell and expression of the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest by the host cell. Introduction of the nucleic acid molecules or vectors into a host cell to produce a transformed host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., <i>Basic Methods In Molecular Biology </i>(1986). Expression of polypeptides encoded by the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may also be accomplished by in vitro transcription/translation systems. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0205\"> Once transformed host cells have been obtained, the cells may be cultivated under any physiologically compatible conditions of pH and temperature, in any suitable nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and essential minerals that support host cell growth. Recombinant polypeptide-producing cultivation conditions will vary according to the type of vector used to transform the host cells. For example, certain expression vectors comprise regulatory regions which require cell growth at certain temperatures, or addition of certain chemicals or inducing agents to the cell growth medium, to initiate the gene expression resulting in the production of the recombinant polypeptide. Thus, the term \u201crecombinant polypeptide-producing conditions,\u201d as used herein, is not meant to be limited to any one set of cultivation conditions. Appropriate culture media and conditions for the above-described host cells and vectors are well-known in the art. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0207\" num=\"0206\"> Following its production in the host cells, the polypeptide of interest may be isolated by several techniques. To liberate the polypeptide of interest from the host cells, the cells are lysed or ruptured. This lysis may be accomplished by contacting the cells with a hypotonic solution, by treatment with a cell wall-disrupting enzyme such as lysozyme, by sonication, by treatment with high pressure, or by a combination of the above methods. Other methods of bacterial cell disruption and lysis that are known to one of ordinary skill may also be used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0207\"> Following disruption, the polypeptide may be separated from the cellular debris by any technique suitable for separation of particles in complex mixtures. The polypeptide may then be purified by well known isolation techniques. Suitable techniques for purification include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, electrophoresis, immunoadsorption, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography (LC), high performance LC (HPLC), fast performance LC (FPLC), hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. </p>\\n    <p id=\"h-0017\" num=\"0000\"> Kits </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0209\" num=\"0208\"> The present invention also provides kits for use in the mutagenesis or modification (e.g., labeling) of a nucleic acid molecule. Mutagenesis kits and nucleic acids modification kits according to the present invention comprise a carrier means, such as a box, carton, tube or the like, having in close confinement therein one or more container means, such as vials, tubes, ampules, bottles and the like. In one aspect, a first container means contains a stable composition comprising a mixture of reagents, at working concentrations, which are at least one Translesion DNA polymerase, at least one buffer salt, and at least one deoxynucleoside triphosphate. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0210\" num=\"0209\"> For mutagenesis, the kits of the invention may comprise one or more of the following components: (i) one or more Translesion DNA polymerases, (ii) one or more non-translesion DNA polymerase, (iii) one or more suitable buffers, (iv) one or more nucleotides, and (v) one or more primers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0211\" num=\"0210\"> For synthesizing modified nucleic acids, the kits of the invention may comprise one or more of the following components: (i) one or more Translesion DNA polymerases, (ii) one or more non-translesion polymerase, (iii) one or more suitable buffers, (iv) one or more nucleotides, (v) one or more modified nucleotides, and (vi) one or more primers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0212\" num=\"0211\"> The kits may further comprise additional reagents and compounds necessary for carrying out standard nucleic synthesis protocols (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202, which are directed to methods of DNA amplification by PCR; WO 007 1559, directed to methods of producing improved primers, WO 98/06736, directed to stable compositions of DNA polymerases). </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0213\" num=\"0212\"> The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA and immunology, which are within the capabilities of a person of ordinary skill in the art.
