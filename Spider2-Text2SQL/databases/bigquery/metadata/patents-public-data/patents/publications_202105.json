The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated and/or simplified in places for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations based on the following examples of possible embodiments. \\n     Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to  FIG. 1 , there is illustrated a general overview of the manner for providing improved spectral efficiency within various communication protocol interfaces  102 , using a combination of multiple level overlay modulation  104  and the application of orbital angular momentum  106  to increase the number of communications channels. \\n     The various communication protocol interfaces  102  may be comprised of a variety of system links using the electromagnetic spectrum, such as RF, cable or twisted pair, or optical making use of light wavelengths such as fiber-optic communications or free-space optics. Various types of RF communications may include a combination of RF microwave, RF satellite communication, nomadic and mobile wireless systems, as well as multiplexing between RF and free-space optics in real time. \\n     By combining a multiple layer overlay modulation technique  104  with orbital angular momentum (OAM) technique  106 , a higher throughput over various types of system  102  may be achieved. The use of multiple level overlay modulation alone without OAM increases the spectral efficiency of systems  102 , whether wired, optical, or wireless. However, together with OAM, the increase in spectral efficiency is even more significant. \\n     Multiple overlay modulation techniques  104  provide a new degree of freedom beyond the conventional 2 degrees of freedom, with time T and frequency F being independent variables in a two-dimensional notational space defining orthogonal axes in an information diagram. This comprises a more general approach rather than modeling signals as fixed in either the frequency or time domain. Previous modeling methods using fixed time or fixed frequency are considered to be more limiting cases of the general approach of using multiple level overlay modulation  104 . Within the multiple level overlay modulation technique  104 , signals may be differentiated in two-dimensional space rather than along a single axis. Thus, the information-carrying capacity and/or spectral efficiency of a system may be determined by a number of signals which occupy different time and frequency coordinates and may be differentiated in a notational two-dimensional space. \\n     Within the notational two-dimensional space, minimization of the time bandwidth product, i.e., the area occupied by a signal in that space, enables denser packing, and thus, the use of more signals, with higher resulting information-carrying capacity and/or spectral efficiency, within a fixed bandwidth. Given the frequency bandwidth delta (\u0394f), a given signal transmitted through it in minimum time \u0394t will have an envelope described by certain time-bandwidth minimizing signals. The time-bandwidth products for these signals take the form; \\n       \u0394 t\u0394f= \u00bd(2 n+ 1)\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n \\n     where n is an integer ranging from 0 to infinity, denoting the order of the signal. \\n     These signals form an orthogonal set of infinite elements, where each has a finite amount of energy. They are finite in both the time domain and the frequency domain, and can be detected from a mix of other signals and noise through correlation, for example, by match filtering. Unlike other wavelets, these orthogonal signals have similar time and frequency forms. \\n     The orbital angular momentum process  106  provides a twist to wave fronts of the electromagnetic fields carrying the data stream that may enable the transmission of multiple data streams on the same frequency, wavelength, or other signal-supporting mechanism. This will increase the bandwidth over a system by allowing a single frequency or wavelength to support multiple eigen channels, each of the individual channels having a different orthogonal and independent orbital angular momentum associated therewith. \\n     In one embodiment, referring now to  FIG. 2 , there is illustrated a further communication implementation technique using the above described techniques as twisted pairs or cables carry electrons (not photons). Rather than using each of the multiple level overlay modulation  104  and orbital angular momentum techniques  106 , only the multiple level overlay modulation  104  can be used in conjunction with a single wireline interface and, more particularly, a twisted pair communication link or a cable communication link  202 . The operation of the multiple level overlay modulation  204 , is similar to that discussed previously with respect to  FIG. 1 , but is used by itself without the use of orbital angular momentum techniques  106 , and is used with either a twisted pair communication link or cable interface communication link  202 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 3 , there is illustrated a general block diagram for processing a plurality of data streams  302  for transmission in an optical communication system. The multiple data streams  302  are provided to the multi-layer overlay modulation circuitry  304  wherein the signals are modulated using the multi-layer overlay modulation technique. The modulated signals are provided to orbital angular momentum processing circuitry  306  which applies a twist to each of the wave fronts being transmitted on the wavelengths of the optical communication channel. The twisted waves are transmitted through the optical interface  308  over an optical communications link such as an optical fiber or free space optics communication system.  FIG. 3  may also illustrate an RF mechanism wherein the interface  308  would comprise and RF interface rather than an optical interface. \\n     Referring now more particularly to  FIG. 4 , there is illustrated a functional block diagram of a system for generating the orbital angular momentum \u201ctwist\u201d within a communication system, such as that illustrated with respect to  FIG. 1 , to provide a data stream that may be combined with multiple other data streams for transmission upon a same wavelength or frequency. Multiple data streams  402  are provided to the transmission processing circuitry  400 . Each of the data streams  402  comprises, for example, an end to end connection carrying a voice call or a packet connection transmitting non-circuit switch packed data over a data connection. The multiple data streams  402  are processed by modulator/demodulator circuitry  404 . The modulator/demodulator circuitry  404  modulates the received data stream  402  onto a wavelength or frequency channel using a multiple level overlay modulation technique, as will be more fully described herein below. The communications link may comprise an optical fiber link, free-space optics link, RF microwave link, RF satellite link, wired link (without the twist), etc. \\n     The modulated data stream is provided to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) signal processing block  406 . Each of the modulated data streams from the modulator/demodulator  404  are provided a different orbital angular momentum by the orbital angular momentum electromagnetic block  406  such that each of the modulated data streams have a unique and different orbital angular momentum associated therewith. Each of the modulated signals having an associated orbital angular momentum are provided to an optical transmitter  408  that transmits each of the modulated data streams having a unique orbital angular momentum on a same wavelength. Each wavelength has a selected number of bandwidth slots B and may have its data transmission capability increase by a factor of the number of degrees of orbital angular momentum   that are provided from the OAM electromagnetic block  406 . The optical transmitter  408  transmitting signals at a single wavelength could transmit B groups of information. The optical transmitter  408  and OAM electromagnetic block  406  may transmit  \u00d7B groups of information according to the configuration described herein. \\n     In a receiving mode, the optical transmitter  408  will have a wavelength including multiple signals transmitted therein having different orbital angular momentum signals embedded therein. The optical transmitter  408  forwards these signals to the OAM signal processing block  406 , which separates each of the signals having different orbital angular momentum and provides the separated signals to the demodulator circuitry  404 . The demodulation process extracts the data streams  402  from the modulated signals and provides it at the receiving end using the multiple layer overlay demodulation technique. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 5 , there is provided a more detailed functional description of the OAM signal processing block  406 . Each of the input data streams are provided to OAM circuitry  502 . Each of the OAM circuitry  502  provides a different orbital angular momentum to the received data stream. The different orbital angular momentums are achieved by applying different currents for the generation of the signals that are being transmitted to create a particular orbital angular momentum associated therewith. The orbital angular momentum provided by each of the OAM circuitries  502  are unique to the data stream that is provided thereto. An infinite number of orbital angular momentums may be applied to different input data streams using many different currents. Each of the separately generated data streams are provided to a signal combiner  504 , which combines the signals onto a wavelength for transmission from the transmitter  506 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 6 , there is illustrated an embodiment in which the OAM processing circuitry  406  may separate a received signal into multiple data streams. The receiver  602  receives the combined OAM signals on a single wavelength and provides this information to a signal separator  604 . The signal separator  604  separates each of the signals having different orbital angular momentums from the received wavelength and provides the separated signals to OAM de-twisting circuitry  606 . The OAM de-twisting circuitry  606  removes the associated OAM twist from each of the associated signals and provides the received modulated data stream for further processing. The signal separator  604  separates each of the received signals that have had the orbital angular momentum removed therefrom into individual received signals. The individually received signals are provided to the receiver  602  for demodulation using, for example, multiple level overlay demodulation as will be more fully described herein below. \\n       FIG. 7  illustrates in a manner in which a single wavelength or frequency, having two quanti-spin polarizations may provide an infinite number of twists having various orbital angular momentums associated therewith. The 1 axis represents the various quantized orbital angular momentum states which may be applied to a particular signal at a selected frequency or wavelength. The symbol omega (\u03c9) represents the various frequencies to which the signals of differing orbital angular momentum may be applied. The top grid  702  represents the potentially available signals for a left handed signal polarization, while the bottom grid  704  is for potentially available signals having right handed polarization. \\n     By applying different orbital angular momentum states to a signal at a particular frequency or wavelength, a potentially infinite number of states may be provided at the frequency or wavelength. Thus, the state at the frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength  706  in both the left handed polarization plane  702  and the right handed polarization plane  704  can provide an infinite number of signals at different orbital angular momentum states \u0394l. Blocks  708  and  710  represent a particular signal having an orbital angular momentum \u0394l at a frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength in both the right handed polarization plane  704  and left handed polarization plane  710 , respectively. By changing to a different orbital angular momentum within the same frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength  706 , different signals may also be transmitted. Each angular momentum state corresponds to a different determined current level for transmission from the optical transmitter. By estimating the equivalent current for generating a particular orbital angular momentum within the optical domain and applying this current for transmission of the signals, the transmission of the signal may be achieved at a desired orbital angular momentum state. \\n     Thus, the illustration of  FIG. 7 , illustrates two possible angular momentums, the spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum. The spin version is manifested within the polarizations of macroscopic electromagnetism, and has only left and right hand polarizations due to up and down spin directions. However, the orbital angular momentum indicates an infinite number of states that are quantized. The paths are more than two and can theoretically be infinite through the quantized orbital angular momentum levels. \\n     It is well-known that the concept of linear momentum is usually associated with objects moving in a straight line. The object could also carry angular momentum if it has a rotational motion, such as spinning (i.e., spin angular momentum (SAM)  802 ), or orbiting around an axis  806  (i.e., OAM  804 ), as shown in  FIGS. 8A and 8B , respectively. A light beam may also have rotational motion as it propagates. In paraxial approximation, a light beam carries SAM  802  if the electrical field rotates along the beam axis  806  (i.e., circularly polarized light  805 ), and carries OAM  804  if the wave vector spirals around the beam axis  806 , leading to a helical phase front  808 , as shown in  FIGS. 8C and 8D . In its analytical expression, this helical phase front  808  is usually related to a phase term of exp(i \u03b8) in the transverse plane, where \u03b8 refers to the angular coordinate, and   is an integer indicating the number of intertwined helices (i.e., the number of 2\u03c0 phase shifts along the circle around the beam axis).   could be a positive, negative integer or zero, corresponding to clockwise, counterclockwise phase helices or a Gaussian beam with no helix, respectively. \\n     Two important concepts relating to OAM include: \\n     1) OAM and polarization: As mentioned above, an OAM beam is manifested as a beam with a helical phase front and therefore a twisting wavevector, while polarization states can only be connected to SAM  802 . A light beam carries SAM  802  of \u00b1h/2\u03c0 (h is Plank&#39;s constant) per photon if it is left or right circularly polarized, and carries no SAM  802  if it is linearly polarized. Although the SAM  802  and OAM  804  of light can be coupled to each other under certain scenarios, they can be clearly distinguished for a paraxial light beam. Therefore, with the paraxial assumption, OAM  804  and polarization can be considered as two independent properties of light. \\n     2) OAM beam and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam: In general, an OAM-carrying beam could refer to any helically phased light beam, irrespective of its radial distribution (although sometimes OAM could also be carried by a non-helically phased beam). LG beam is a special subset among all OAM-carrying beams, due to that the analytical expression of LG beams are eigen-solutions of paraxial form of the wave equation in a cylindrical coordinates. For an LG beam, both azimuthal and radial wavefront distributions are well defined, and are indicated by two index numbers,   and p, of which   has the same meaning as that of a general OAM beam, and p refers to the radial nodes in the intensity distribution. Mathematical expressions of LG beams form an orthogonal and complete basis in the spatial domain. In contrast, a general OAM beam actually comprises a group of LG beams (each with the same   index but a different p index) due to the absence of radial definition. The term of \u201cOAM beam\u201d refers to all helically phased beams, and is used to distinguish from LG beams. \\n     Using the orbital angular momentum state of the transmitted energy signals, physical information can be embedded within the radiation transmitted by the signals. The Maxwell-Heaviside equations can be represented as: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u2207 \\n                       \\n                         \u00b7 \\n                         E \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     = \\n                     \\n                       \u03c1 \\n                       \\n                         \u025b \\n                         0 \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u2207 \\n                       \\n                         \u00d7 \\n                         E \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     = \\n                     \\n                       - \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \u2202 \\n                           B \\n                         \\n                         \\n                           \u2202 \\n                           t \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u2207 \\n                       \\n                         \u00b7 \\n                         B \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     = \\n                     0 \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u2207 \\n                       \\n                         \u00d7 \\n                         B \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     = \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \u025b \\n                           0 \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                           \u03bc \\n                           0 \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             \u2202 \\n                             E \\n                           \\n                           \\n                             \u2202 \\n                             t \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                       + \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \u03bc \\n                           0 \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                           j \\n                           \\ue8a0 \\n                           \\n                             ( \\n                             \\n                               t \\n                               , \\n                               x \\n                             \\n                             ) \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n               \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   2 \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     where \u2207 is the del operator, E is the electric field intensity and B is the magnetic flux density. Using these equations, one can derive 23 symmetries/conserved quantities from Maxwell&#39;s original equations. However, there are only ten well-known conserved quantities and only a few of these are commercially used. Historically if Maxwell&#39;s equations where kept in their original quaternion forms, it would have been easier to see the symmetries/conserved quantities, but when they were modified to their present vectorial form by Heaviside, it became more difficult to see such inherent symmetries in Maxwell&#39;s equations. \\n     The conserved quantities and the electromagnetic field can be represented according to the conservation of system energy and the conservation of system linear momentum.

In the plane wave situation illustrated generally at  902 , the transmitted signal may take one of three configurations. When the electric field vectors are in the same direction, a linear signal is provided, as illustrated generally at  904 . Within a circular polarization  906 , the electric field vectors rotate with the same magnitude. Within the elliptical polarization  908 , the electric field vectors rotate but have differing magnitudes. The Poynting vector remains in a constant direction for the signal configuration to  FIG. 9A  and always perpendicular to the electric and magnetic fields. Referring now to  FIG. 9B , when a unique orbital angular momentum is applied to a signal as described here and above, the Poynting vector S  910  will spiral about the direction of propagation of the signal. This spiral may be varied in order to enable signals to be transmitted on the same frequency as described herein. \\n       FIGS. 12A-12C  illustrate the differences in signals having different helicity (i.e., orbital angular momentums). Each of the spiraling Poynting vectors associated with the signals  902 ,  904 , and  906  provide a different shaped signal. Signal  1202  has an orbital angular momentum of +1, signal  1204  has an orbital angular momentum of +3, and signal  1206  has an orbital angular momentum of \u22124. Each signal has a distinct angular momentum and associated Poynting vector enabling the signal to be distinguished from other signals within a same frequency. This allows differing type of information to be combined on the same frequency, since these signals are separately detectable and do not interfere with each other (Eigen channels). \\n       FIG. 12D  illustrates the propagation of Poynting vectors for various Eigen modes. Each of the rings  1220  represents a different Eigen mode or twist representing a different orbital angular momentum within the same frequency. Each of these rings  1220  represents a different orthogonal channel. Each of the Eigen modes has a Poynting vector  1222  associated therewith. \\n     Topological charge may be multiplexed to the frequency for either linear or circular polarization. In case of linear polarizations, topological charge would be multiplexed on vertical and horizontal polarization. In case of circular polarization, topological charge would multiplex on left hand and right hand circular polarizations. The topological charge is another name for the helicity index \u201cI\u201d or the amount of twist or OAM applied to the signal. The helicity index may be positive or negative. In RF, different topological charges can be created and muxed together and de-muxed to separate the topological charges. \\n     The topological charges   s can be created using Spiral Phase Plates (SPPs) as shown in  FIG. 9E  using a proper material with specific index of refraction and ability to machine shop or phase mask, holograms created of new materials or a new technique to create an RF version of Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) that does the twist of the RF waves (as opposed to optical beams) by adjusting voltages on the device resulting in twisting of the RF waves with a specific topological charge. Spiral Phase plates can transform a RF plane wave ( =0) to a twisted RF wave of a specific helicity (i.e.  =+1). \\n     These embodiments can create cross talk and multipath interference. However, cross talk and multipath interference can be corrected using RF Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO). In one embodiment, most of the channel impairments can be detected using a control or pilot channel and be corrected using algorithmic techniques (closed loop control system). However, other techniques can be used to eliminate these channel impairments. \\n     As described previously with respect to  FIG. 3 , each of the multiple data streams applied within the processing circuitry has a multiple layer overlay modulation scheme applied thereto. \\n     Application of OAM to Optical Communication \\n     Utilization of OAM for optical communications is based on the fact that coaxially propagating light beams with different OAM states can be efficiently separated. This is certainly true for orthogonal modes such as the LG beam. Interestingly, it is also true for general OAM beams with cylindrical symmetry by relying only on the azimuthal phase. Considering any two OAM beams with an azimuthal index of    1  and    2 , respectively: \\n         U   1 ( r,\u03b8,z )= A   1 ( r,z )exp( i     1 \u03b8)\\u2003\\u2003(12)\\n \\n     where r and z refers to the radial position and propagation distance respectively, one can quickly conclude that these two beams are orthogonal in the sense that: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u222b \\n                       0 \\n                       \\n                         2 \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \u03c0 \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         U \\n                         1 \\n                       \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       \\n                         U \\n                         2 \\n                         * \\n                       \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       d \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       \\n                           \\n                       \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       \u03b8 \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   = \\n                   \\n                     { \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           0 \\n                         \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             \\n                               if \\n                               \\ue89e \\n                               \\n                                   \\n                               \\n                               \\ue89e \\n                               \\n                                 \\ue54b \\n                                 1 \\n                               \\n                             \\n                             \u2260 \\n                             \\n                               \\ue54b \\n                               2 \\n                             \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             \\n                               A \\n                               1 \\n                             \\n                             \\ue89e \\n                             \\n                               A \\n                               2 \\n                               * \\n                             \\n                           \\n                         \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             \\n                               if \\n                               \\ue89e \\n                               \\n                                   \\n                               \\n                               \\ue89e \\n                               \\n                                 \\ue54b \\n                                 1 \\n                               \\n                             \\n                             = \\n                             \\n                               \\ue54b \\n                               2 \\n                             \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n               \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   13 \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     There are two different ways to take advantage of the distinction between OAM beams with different   states in communications. In the first approach, N different OAM states can be encoded as N different data symbols representing \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, . . . , \u201cN\u22121\u201d, respectively. A sequence of OAM states sent by the transmitter therefore represents data information. At the receiver, the data can be decoded by checking the received OAM state. This approach seems to be more favorable to the quantum communications community, since OAM could provide for the encoding of multiple bits (log 2(N)) per photon due to the infinitely countable possibilities of the OAM states, and so could potentially achieve a higher photon efficiency. The encoding/decoding of OAM states could also have some potential applications for on-chip interconnection to increase computing speed or data capacity. \\n     The second approach is to use each OAM beam as a different data carrier in an SDM (Spatial Division Multiplexing) system. For an SDM system, one could use either a multi-core fiber/free space laser beam array so that the data channels in each core/laser beam are spatially separated, or use a group of orthogonal mode sets to carry different data channels in a multi-mode fiber (MMF) or in free space. Greater than 1 petabit/s data transmission in a multi-core fiber and up to 6 linearly polarized (LP) modes each with two polarizations in a single core multi-mode fiber has been reported. Similar to the SDM using orthogonal modes, OAM beams with different states can be spatially multiplexed and demultiplexed, thereby providing independent data carriers in addition to wavelength and polarization. Ideally, the orthogonality of OAM beams can be maintained in transmission, which allows all the data channels to be separated and recovered at the receiver. A typical embodiments of OAM multiplexing is conceptually depicted in  FIG. 11 . An obvious benefit of OAM multiplexing is the improvement in system spectral efficiency, since the same bandwidth can be reused for additional data channels. \\n     OAM Beam Generation and Detection \\n     Many approaches for creating OAM beams have been proposed and demonstrated. One could obtain a single or multiple OAM beams directly from the output of a laser cavity, or by converting a fundamental Gaussian beam into an OAM beam outside a cavity. The converter could be a spiral phase plate, diffractive phase holograms, metalmaterials, cylindrical lens pairs, q-plates or fiber structures. There are also different ways to detect an OAM beam, such as using a converter that creates a conjugate helical phase, or using a plasmonic detector. \\n     Mode Conversion Approaches \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 12 , among all external-cavity methods, perhaps the most straightforward one is to pass a Gaussian beam through a coaxially placed spiral phase plate (SPP)  1202 . An SPP  1202  is an optical element with a helical surface, as shown in  FIG. 12A . To produce an OAM beam with a state of  , the thickness profile of the plate should be machined as  \u03bb\u03b8/2\u03c0(n\u22121), where n is the refractive index of the medium. A limitation of using an SPP  1202  is that each OAM state requires a different specific plate. As an alternative, reconfigurable diffractive optical elements, e.g., a pixelated spatial light modulator (SLM)  1204 , or a digital micro-mirror device can be programmed to function as any refractive element of choice at a given wavelength. As mentioned above, a helical phase profile exp(i \u03b8) converts a linearly polarized Gaussian laser beam into an OAM mode, whose wave front resembles an  -fold corkscrew  1206 , as shown at  1204 . Importantly, the generated OAM beam can be easily changed by simply updating the hologram loaded on the SLM  1204 . To spatially separate the phase-modulated beam from the zeroth-order non-phase-modulated reflection from the SLM, a linear phase ramp is added to helical phase code (i.e., a \u201cfork\u201d-like phase pattern  1208  to produce a spatially distinct first-order diffracted OAM beam, carrying the desired charge. It should also be noted that the aforementioned methods produce OAM beams with only an azimuthal index control. To generate a pure LG_( ,p) mode, one must jointly control both the phase and the intensity of the wavefront. This could be achieved using a phase-only SLM with a more complex phase hologram. \\n     OAM Beams Multiplexing and Demultiplexing \\n     One of the benefits of OAM is that multiple coaxially propagating OAM beams with different   states provide additional data carriers as they can be separated based only on the twisting wavefront. Hence, one of the critical techniques is the efficient multiplexing/demultiplexing of OAM beams of different   states, where each carries an independent data channel and all beams can be transmitted and received using a single aperture pair. Several multiplexing and demultiplexing techniques have been demonstrated, including the use of an inverse helical phase hologram to down-convert the OAM into a Gaussian beam, a mode sorter, free-space interferometers, a photonic integrated circuit, and q-plates. Some of these techniques are briefly described below. \\n     Beam Splitter and Inverse Phase Hologram \\n     A straightforward way of multiplexing is simply to use cascaded 3-dB beam splitters (BS)  1302 . Each BS  1302  can coaxially multiplex two beams  1303  that are properly aligned, and cascaded N BSs can multiplex N+1 independent OAM beams at most, as shown in  FIG. 13A . Similarly, at the receiver end, the multiplexed beam  1305  is divided into four copies  1304  by BS  1302 . To demultiplex the data channel on one of the beams (e.g., with l=1_i), a phase hologram  1306  with a spiral charge of  \u2212l _i is applied to all the multiplexed beams  1304 . As a result, the helical phase on the target beam is removed, and this beam evolves into a fundamental Gaussian beam, as shown in  FIG. 13B . The down-converted beam can be isolated from the other beams, which still have helical phase fronts by using a spatial mode filter  1308  (e.g., a single mode fiber only couples the power of the fundamental Gaussian mode due to the mode matching theory). Accordingly, each of the multiplexed beams  1304  can be demultiplexed by changing the spiral phase hologram  1306 . Although this method is very power-inefficient since the BSs  1302  and the spatial mode filter  1306  cause a lot of power loss, it was used in the initial lab demonstrations of OAM multiplexing/demultiplexing, due to the simplicity of understanding and the reconfigurability provided by programmable SLMs. \\n     Optical Geometrical Transformation-Based Mode Sorter \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 14 , another method of multiplexing and demultiplexing, which could be more power-efficient than the previous one (using beam splitters), is the use of an OAM mode sorter. This mode sorter usually comprises three optical elements, including a transformer  1402 , a corrector  1404 , and a lens  1406 , as shown in  FIG. 14 . The transformer  1402  performs a geometrical transformation of the input beam from log-polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, such that the position (x,y) in the input plane is mapped to a new position (u,v) in the output plane, where \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               u \\n               = \\n               \\n                 \\n                   - \\n                   a \\n                 \\n                 \\ue89e \\n                 \\n                     \\n                 \\n                 \\ue89e \\n                 \\n                   ln \\n                   \\ue8a0 \\n                   \\n                     ( \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             x \\n                             2 \\n                           \\n                           + \\n                           \\n                             y \\n                             2 \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                       b \\n                     \\n                     ) \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n             , \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     and v=a arctan(y/x). Here, a and b are scaling constants. The corrector  1404  compensates for phase errors and ensures that the transformed beam is collimated. Considering an input OAM beam with a ring-shaped beam profile, it can be unfolded and mapped into a rectangular-shaped plane wave with a tilted phase front. Similarly, multiple OAM beams having different 1 states will be transformed into a series of plane waves each with a different phase tilt. A lens  1406  focuses these tilted plane waves into spatially separated spots in the focal plane such that all the OAM beams are simultaneously demultiplexed. As the transformation is reciprocal, if the mode sorter is used in reverse it can become a multiplexer for OAM. A Gaussian beam array placed in the focal plane of the lens  1406  is converted into superimposed plane waves with different tilts. These beams then pass through the corrector and the transformer sequentially to produce properly multiplexed OAM beams. \\n     Free Space Communications \\n     The first proof-of-concept experiment using OAM for free space communications transmitted eight different OAM states each representing a data symbol one at a time. The azimuthal index of the transmitted OAM beam is measured at the receiver using a phase hologram modulated with a binary grating. To effectively use this approach, fast switching is required between different OAM states to achieve a high data rate. Alternatively, classic communications using OAM states as data carriers can be multiplexed at the transmitter, co-propagated through a free space link, and demultiplexed at a receiver. The total data rate of a free space communication link has reached 100 Tbit/s or even beyond by using OAM multiplexing. The propagation of OAM beams through a real environment (e.g., across a city) is also under investigation. \\n     Basic Link Demonstrations \\n     Referring now to  FIGS. 15A-15C , initial demonstrates of using OAM multiplexing for optical communications include free space links using a Gaussian beam and an OAM beam encoded with OOK data. Four monochromatic Gaussian beams each carrying an independent 50.8 Gbit/s (4\u00d712.7 Gbit/s) 16-QAM signal were prepared from an IQ modulator and free-space collimators. The beams were converted to OAM beams with  =\u22128, +10, +12 and \u221214, respectively, using 4 SLMs each loaded with a helical phase hologram, as shown in  FIG. 15A . After being coaxially multiplexed using cascaded 3 dB-beam splitters, the beams were propagated through \u02dc1 m distance in free-space under lab conditions. The OAM beams were detected one at a time, using an inverse helical phase hologram and a fiber collimator together with a SMF. The 16-QAM data on each channel was successfully recovered, and a spectral efficiency of 12.8 bit/s/Hz in this data link was achieved, as shown in  FIGS. 15B and 15C . \\n     A following experiment doubled the spectral efficiency by adding the polarization multiplexing into the OAM-multiplexed free-space data link. Four different OAM beams ( =+4, +8, \u22128, +16) on each of two orthogonal polarizations (eight channels in total) were used to achieve a Terabit/s transmission link. The eight OAM beams were multiplexed and demultiplexed using the same approach as mentioned above. The measured crosstalk among channels carried by the eight OAM beams is shown in Table 1, with the largest crosstalk being \u02dc\u221218.5 dB. Each of the beams was encoded with a 42.8 Gbaud 16-QAM signal, allowing a total capacity of \u02dc1.4 (42.8\u00d74\u00d74\u00d72) Tbit/s. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                   \\n                 TABLE 1 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 OAM + 4 \\n                 OAM + 8 \\n                 OAM \u2212 8 \\n                 OAM + 16 \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Measured Crosstalk \\n                 X-Pol. \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                 X-Pol. \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                 X-Pol. \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                 X-Pol. \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 OAM + 4 (dB) \\n                 X-Pol. \\n                   \\n                 \u221223.2 \\n                 \u221226.7 \\n                 \u221230.8 \\n                 \u221230.5 \\n                 \u221227.7 \\n                 \u221224.6 \\n                 \u221230.1 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                 \u221225.7 \\n               \\n               \\n                 OAM + 8 (dB) \\n                 X-Pol \\n                 \u221226.6 \\n                 \u221223.5 \\n                   \\n                 \u221221.6 \\n                 \u221218.9 \\n                 \u221225.4 \\n                 \u221223.9 \\n                 \u221228.8 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 \u221225.0 \\n               \\n               \\n                 OAM \u2212 8 (dB) \\n                 X-Pol \\n                 \u221227.5 \\n                 \u221233.9 \\n                 \u221227.6 \\n                 \u221230.8 \\n                   \\n                 \u221220.5 \\n                 \u221226.5 \\n                 \u221221.6 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 \u221226.8 \\n               \\n               \\n                 OAM + 16 (dB) \\n                 X-Pol \\n                 \u221224.5 \\n                 \u221231.2 \\n                 \u221223.7 \\n                 \u221223.3 \\n                 \u221225.8 \\n                 \u221226.1 \\n                   \\n                 \u221230.2 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 Y-Pol. \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 \u221224.0 \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Total from other \\n                 \u221221.8 \\n                 \u221221.0 \\n                 \u221221.2 \\n                 \u221221.4 \\n                 \u221218.5 \\n                 \u221221.2 \\n                 \u221222.2 \\n                 \u221220.7 \\n               \\n               \\n                 OAMs * (dB) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     The capacity of the free-space data link was further increased to 100 Tbit/s by combining OAM multiplexing with PDM (phase division multiplexing) and WDM (wave division multiplexing). In this experiment, 24 OAM beams ( =\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119, each with two polarizations) were prepared using 2 SLMs, the procedures for which are shown in  FIG. 16  at  1602 - 1606 . Specifically, one SLM generated a superposition of OAM beams with  =+4, +10, and +16, while the other SLM generated another set of three OAM beams with  =+7, +13, and +19 ( FIG. 16A ). These two outputs were multiplexed together using a beam splitter, thereby multiplexing six OAM beams:  =+4, +7, +10, +13, +16, and +19 ( FIG. 16A ). Secondly, the six multiplexed OAM beams were split into two copies. One copy was reflected five times by three mirrors and two beam splitters, to create another six OAM beams with inverse charges ( FIG. 16B ). There was a differential delay between the two light paths to de-correlate the data. These two copies were then combined again to achieve  12  multiplexed OAM beams with  =\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119 ( FIG. 16B ). These 12 OAM beams were split again via a beam splitter. One of these was polarization-rotated by 90 degrees, delayed by \u02dc33 symbols, and then recombined with the other copy using a polarization beam splitter (PBS), finally multiplexing 24 OAM beams (with  =\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119 on two polarizations). Each of the beam carried a WDM signal comprising 100 GHz-spaced 42 wavelengths (1,536.34-1,568.5 nm), each of which was modulated with 100 Gbit/s QPSK data. The observed optical spectrum of the WDM signal carried on one of the demultiplexed OAM beams ( =+10). \\n     Atmospheric Turbulence Effects on OAM Beams \\n     One of the critical challenges for a practical free-space optical communication system using OAM multiplexing is atmospheric turbulence. It is known that inhomogeneities in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere lead to random variations in the refractive index along the transmission path, and can easily distort the phase front of a light beam. This could be particularly important for OAM communications, since the separation of multiplexed OAM beams relies on the helical phase-front. As predicted by simulations in the literature, these refractive index inhomogeneities may cause inter-modal crosstalk among data channels with different OAM states. \\n     The effect of atmospheric turbulence is also experimentally evaluated. For the convenience of estimating the turbulence strength, one approach is to emulate the turbulence in the lab using an SLM or a rotating phase plate.  FIG. 17A  illustrates an emulator built using a thin phase screen plate  1702  that is mounted on a rotation stage  1704  and placed in the middle of the optical path. The pseudo-random phase distribution machined on the plate  1702  obeys Kolmogorov spectrum statistics, which are usually characterized by a specific effective Fried coherence length r 0 . The strength of the simulated turbulence  1706  can be varied either by changing to a plate  1702  with a different r 0 , or by adjusting the size of the beam that is incident on the plate. The resultant turbulence effect is mainly evaluated by measuring the power of the distorted beam distributed to each OAM mode using an OAM mode sorter. It was found that, as the turbulence strength increases, the power of the transmitted OAM mode would leak to neighboring modes and tend to be equally distributed among modes for stronger turbulence. As an example,  FIG. 17B  shows the measured average power (normalized) l=3 beam under different emulated turbulence conditions. It can be seen that the majority of the power is still in the transmitted OAM mode  1708  under weak turbulence, but it spreads to neighboring modes as the turbulence strength increases. \\n     Turbulence Effects Mitigation Techniques \\n     One approach to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on OAM beams is to use an adaptive optical (AO) system. The general idea of an AO system is to measure the phase front of the distorted beam first, based on which an error correction pattern can be produced and can be applied onto the beam transmitter to undo the distortion. As for OAM beams with helical phase fronts, it is challenging to directly measure the phase front using typical wavefront sensors due to the phase singularity. A modified AO system can overcome this problem by sending a Gaussian beam as a probe beam to sense the distortion, as shown in  FIG. 18A . Due to the fact that turbulence is almost independent of the light polarization, the probe beam is orthogonally polarized as compared to all other beams for the sake of convenient separation at beam separator  1802 . The correction phase pattern can be derived based on the probe beam distortion that is directly measured by a wavefront sensor  1704 . It is noted that this phase correction pattern can be used to simultaneously compensate multiple coaxially propagating OAM beams.  FIG. 18  at  1810 - 1820  illustrate the intensity profiles of OAM beams with l=1, 5 and 9, respectively, for a random turbulence realization with and without mitigation. From the far-field images, one can see that the distorted OAM beams (upper), up to l=9, were partially corrected, and the measured power distribution also indicates that the channel crosstalk can be reduced. \\n     Another approach for combating turbulence effects is to partially move the complexity of optical setup into the electrical domain, and use digital signal processing (DSP) to mitigate the channel crosstalk. A typical DSP method is the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) equalization, which is able to blindly estimate the channel crosstalk and cancel the interference. The implementation of a 4\u00d74 adaptive MIMO equalizer in a four-channel OAM multiplexed free space optical link using heterodyne detection may be used. Four OAM beams (l=+2, +4, +6 and +8), each carrying 20 Gbit/s QPSK data, were collinearly multiplexed and propagated through a weak turbulence emulated by the rotating phase plate under laboratory condition to introduce distortions. After demultiplexing, four channels were coherently detected and recorded simultaneously. The standard constant modulus algorithm is employed in addition to the standard procedures of coherent detection to equalize the channel interference. Results indicate that MIMO equalization could be helpful to mitigate the crosstalk caused by either turbulence or imperfect mode generation/detection, and improve both error vector magnitude (EVM) and the bit-error-rate (BER) of the signal in an OAM-multiplexed communication link. MIMO DSP may not be universally useful as outage could happen in some scenarios involving free space data links. For example, the majority power of the transmitted OAM beams may be transferred to other OAM states under a strong turbulence without being detected, in which case MIMO would not help to improve the system performance. \\n     OAM Free Space Link Design Considerations \\n     To date, most of the experimental demonstrations of optical communication links using OAM beams took place in the lab conditions. There is a possibility that OAM beams may also be used in a free space optical communication link with longer distances. To design such a data link using OAM multiplexing, several important issues such as beam divergence, aperture size and misalignment of two transmitter and receiver, need to be resolved. To study how those parameters affect the performance of an OAM multiplexed system, a simulation model was described by Xie et al, the schematic setup of which is shown in  FIG. 19 . Each of the different collimated Gaussian beams  1902  at the same wavelength is followed by a spiral phase plate  1904  with a unique order to convert the Gaussian beam into a data-carrying OAM beam. Different orders of OAM beams are then multiplexed at multiplexor  1906  to form a concentric-ring-shape and coaxially propagate from transmitter  1908  through free space to the receiver aperture located at a certain propagation distance. Propagation of multiplexed OAM beams is numerically propagated using the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integral. To investigate the signal power and crosstalk effect on neighboring OAM channels, power distribution among different OAM modes is analyzed through a modal decomposition approach, which corresponds to the case where the received OAM beams are demultiplexed without power loss and the power of a desired OAM channel is completely collected by its receiver  1910 . \\n     Beam Divergence \\n     For a communication link, it is generally preferable to collect as much signal power as possible at the receiver to ensure a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on the diffraction theory, it is known that a collimated OAM beam diverges while propagating in free space. Given the same spot size of three cm at the transmitter, an OAM beam with a higher azimuthal index diverges even faster, as shown in  FIG. 20A . On the other hand, the receiving optical element usually has a limited aperture size and may not be able to collect all of the beam power. The calculated link power loss as a function of receiver aperture size is shown in  FIG. 35B , with different transmission distances and various transmitted beam sizes. Unsurprisingly, the power loss of a 1-km link is higher than that of a 100-m link under the same transmitted beam size due to larger beam divergence. It is interesting to note that a system with a transmitted beam size of 3 cm suffers less power loss than that of 1 cm and 10 cm over a 100-m link. The 1-cm transmitted beam diverges faster than the 3 cm beam due to its larger diffraction. However, when the transmitted beam size is 10 cm, the geometrical characteristics of the beam dominate over the diffraction, thus leading larger spot size at the receiver than the 3 cm transmitted beam. A trade-off between the diffraction, geometrical characteristics and the number of OAMs of the beam therefore needs to be carefully considered in order to achieve a proper-size received beam when designing a link. \\n     Misalignment Tolerance \\n     Referring now to  FIGS. 21A-21C , besides the power loss due to limited-size aperture and beam divergence, another issue that needs further discussion is the potential misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver. In an ideal OAM multiplexed communication link, transmitter and receiver would be perfectly aligned, (i.e., the center of the receiver would overlap with the center of the transmitted beam  2102 , and the receiver plane  2104  would be perpendicular to the line connecting their centers, as shown in  FIG. 21A ). However, due to difficulties in aligning because of substrate distances, and jitter and vibration of the transmitter/receiver platform, the transmitter and receiver may have relative lateral shift (i.e., lateral displacement) ( FIG. 21B ) or angular shift (i.e., receiver angular error) ( FIG. 21C ). Both types of misalignment may lead to degradation of system performance. \\n     Focusing on a link distance of 100 m,  FIGS. 22A and 22B  show the power distribution among different OAM modes due to lateral displacement and receiver angular error when only  =+3 is transmitted with a transmitted beam size of 3 cm. In order to investigate the effect of misalignment, the receiver aperture size is chosen to be 10 cm, which could cover the whole OAM beam at the receiver. As the lateral displacement or receiver angular error increases, power leakage to other modes (i.e., channel crosstalk) increases while the power on  =+3 state decreases. This is because larger lateral displacement or receiver angular causes larger phase profile mismatch between the received OAM beams and receiver. The power leakage to  =+1 and  =+5 is greater than that of  =+2 and  =+3 due to their larger mode spacing with respect to  =+3. Therefore, a system with larger mode spacing (which also uses higher order OAM states suffers less crosstalk. However, such a system may also have a larger power loss due to the fast divergence of higher order OAM beams, as discussed above. Clearly, this trade-off between channel crosstalk and power loss shall be considered when choosing the mode spacing in a specific OAM multiplexed link. \\n     An additional configuration in which the optical angular momentum processing and multi-layer overlay modulation technique described herein above may prove useful within the optical network framework is use with free-space optics communications. Free-space optics systems provide a number of advantages over traditional RF based systems from improved isolation between the systems, the size and the cost of the receivers/transmitters, need for an FCC license, and by combining space, lighting, and communication into the same system. Referring now to  FIG. 23 , there is illustrated an example of the operation of a free-space communication system. The free-space communication system utilizes a free-space optics transmitter  2302  that transmits a light beam  2304  to a free-space optics receiver  2306 . The major difference between a fiber-optic network and a free-space optic network is that the information beam is transmitted through free space rather than over a fiber-optic cable. This causes a number of link difficulties, which will be more fully discussed herein below. However, because the free space system does not have the optic fiber to act as a waveguide, it is more susceptible to the problems outlined above. Free-space optics is a line of sight technology that uses the invisible beams of light to provide optical bandwidth connections that can send and receive up to 2.5 Gbps of data, voice, and video communications between a transmitter  2302  and a receiver  2306 . Free-space optics uses the same concepts as fiber-optics, except without the use of a fiber-optic cable. Free-space optics systems provide the light beam  2304  within the infrared (IR) spectrum, which is at the low end of the light spectrum. Specifically, the optical signal is in the range of 300 Gigahertz to 1 Terahertz in terms of wavelength. \\n     Presently existing free-space optics systems can provide data rates of up to 10 Gigabits per second at a distance of up to 2.5 kilometers. In outer space, the communications range of free space optical communications is currently on the order of several thousand kilometers, but has the potential to bridge interplanetary distances of millions of kilometers, using optical telescopes as beam expanders. In January of 2013, NASA used lasers to beam an image of the Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter roughly 240,000 miles away. To compensate for atmospheric interference, an error correction code algorithm, similar to that used within compact discs, was implemented. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 24 , there is illustrated a block diagram of a free-space optics system using orbital angular momentum and multilevel overlay modulation according to the present disclosure. The OAM twisted signals, in addition to being transmitted over fiber, may also be transmitted using free optics. In this case, the transmission signals are generated within transmission circuitry  2402  at each of the FSO transceivers  2404 . Free-space optics technology is based on the connectivity between the FSO based optical wireless units, each consisting of an optical transceiver  2404  with a transmitter  2402  and a receiver  2406  to provide full duplex open pair and bidirectional closed pairing capability. Each optical wireless transceiver unit  2404  additionally includes an optical source  2408  plus a lens or telescope  2410  for transmitting light through the atmosphere to another lens  2410  receiving the information. At this point, the receiving lens or telescope  2410  connects to a high sensitivity receiver  2406  via optical fiber  2412 . The transmitting transceiver  2404   a  and the receiving transceiver  2404   b  have to have line of sight to each other and be aligned both laterally and angularly. Obstacles, such as, trees, buildings, animals, and atmospheric conditions, all can hinder the line of sight needed for this communications medium. Since line of sight is so critical, some systems make use of beam divergence or a diffused beam approach, which involves a large field of view that tolerates substantial line of sight interference without significant impact on overall signal quality. The system may also be equipped with auto tracking mechanism  2414  that maintains a tightly focused beam on the receiving transceiver  1904   b , even when the transceivers are mounted on tall buildings or other structures that sway. \\n     The modulated light source used with optical source  2408  is typically a laser or light emitting diode (LED) providing the transmitted optical signal that determines all the transmitter capabilities of the system. Only the detector sensitivity within the receiver  2406  plays an equally important role in total system performance. For telecommunications purposes, only lasers that are capable of being modulated at 20 Megabits per second to 2.5 Gigabits per second can meet current marketplace demands. Additionally, how the device is modulated and how much modulated power is produced are both important to the selection of the device. Lasers in the 780-850 nm and 1520-1600 nm spectral bands meet frequency requirements. \\n     Commercially available FSO systems operate in the near IR wavelength range between 750 and 1600 nm, with one or two systems being developed to operate at the IR wavelength of 10,000 nm. The physics and transmissions properties of optical energy as it travels through the atmosphere are similar throughout the visible and near IR wavelength range, but several factors that influence which wavelengths are chosen for a particular system. \\n     The atmosphere is considered to be highly transparent in the visible and near IR wavelength. However, certain wavelengths or wavelength bands can experience severe absorption. In the near IR wavelength, absorption occurs primarily in response to water particles (i.e., moisture) which are an inherent part of the atmosphere, even under clear weather conditions. There are several transmission windows that are nearly transparent (i.e., have an attenuation of less than 0.2 dB per kilometer) within the 700-10,000 nm wavelength range. These wavelengths are located around specific center wavelengths, with the majority of free-space optics systems designed to operate in the windows of 780-850 nm and 1520-1600 nm. \\n     Wavelengths in the 780-850 nm range are suitable for free-space optics operation and higher power laser sources may operate in this range. At 780 nm, inexpensive CD lasers may be used, but the average lifespan of these lasers can be an issue. These issues may be addressed by running the lasers at a fraction of their maximum rated output power which will greatly increase their lifespan. At around 850 nm, the optical source  2408  may comprise an inexpensive, high performance transmitter and detector components that are readily available and commonly used in network transmission equipment. Highly sensitive silicon (SI) avalanche photodiodes (APD) detector technology and advanced vertical cavity emitting laser may be utilized within the optical source  2408 . \\n     VCSEL technology may be used for operation in the 780 to 850 nm range. Possible disadvantage of this technology include beam detection through the use of a night vision scope, although it is still not possible to demodulate a perceived light beam using this technique. \\n     Wavelengths in the 1520-1600 nm range are well-suited for free-space transmission, and high quality transmitter and detector components are readily available for use within the optical source block  2408 . The combination of low attenuation and high component availability within this wavelength range makes the development of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) free-space optics systems feasible. However, components are generally more expensive and detectors are typically less sensitive and have a smaller receive surface area when compared with silicon avalanche photodiode detectors that operator at the 850 nm wavelength. These wavelengths are compatible with erbium-doped fiber amplifier technology, which is important for high power (greater than 500 milliwatt) and high data rate (greater than 2.5 Gigabytes per second) systems. Fifty to 65 times as much power can be transmitted at the 1520-1600 nm wavelength than can be transmitted at the 780-850 nm wavelength for the same eye safety classification. Disadvantages of these wavelengths include the inability to detect a beam with a night vision scope. The night vision scope is one technique that may be used for aligning the beam through the alignment circuitry  2414 . Class 1 lasers are safe under reasonably foreseeable operating conditions including the use of optical instruments for intrabeam viewing. Class 1 systems can be installed at any location without restriction. \\n     Another potential optical source  2408  comprised Class 1M lasers. Class 1M laser systems operate in the wavelength range from 302.5 to 4000 nm, which is safe under reasonably foreseeable conditions, but may be hazardous if the user employs optical instruments within some portion of the beam path. As a result, Class 1M systems should only be installed in locations where the unsafe use of optical aids can be prevented. Examples of various characteristics of both Class 1 and Class 1M lasers that may be used for the optical source  2408  are illustrated in Table 2 below. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 2 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 Laser \\n                 Power \\n                 Aperture Size \\n                 Distance \\n                 Power Density \\n               \\n               \\n                 Classification \\n                 (mW) \\n                 (mm) \\n                 (m) \\n                 (mW/cm 2 ) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 850-nm Wavelength \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Class 1 \\n                 0.78 \\n                 7 \\n                 14 \\n                 2.03 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 50 \\n                 2000 \\n                 0.04 \\n               \\n               \\n                 Class 1M \\n                 0.78 \\n                 7 \\n                 100 \\n                 2.03 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 500 \\n                 7 \\n                 14 \\n                 1299.88 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 50 \\n                 2000 \\n                 25.48 \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 1550-nm Wavelength \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Class 1 \\n                 10 \\n                 7 \\n                 14 \\n                 26.00 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 25 \\n                 2000 \\n                 2.04 \\n               \\n               \\n                 Class 1M \\n                 10 \\n                 3.5 \\n                 100 \\n                 103.99 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 500 \\n                 7 \\n                 14 \\n                 1299.88 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 25 \\n                 2000 \\n                 101.91 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     The 10,000 nm wavelength is relatively new to the commercial free space optic arena and is being developed because of better fog transmission capabilities. There is presently considerable debate regarding these characteristics because they are heavily dependent upon fog type and duration. Few components are available at the 10,000 nm wavelength, as it is normally not used within telecommunications equipment. Additionally, 10,000 nm energy does not penetrate glass, so it is ill-suited to behind window deployment. \\n     Within these wavelength windows, FSO systems should have the following characteristics. The system should have the ability to operate at higher power levels, which is important for longer distance FSO system transmissions. The system should have the ability to provide high speed modulation, which is important for high speed FSO systems. The system should provide a small footprint and low power consumption, which is important for overall system design and maintenance. The system should have the ability to operate over a wide temperature range without major performance degradations such that the systems may prove useful for outdoor systems. Additionally, the mean time between failures should exceed 10 years. Presently existing FSO systems generally use VCSELS for operation in the shorter IR wavelength range, and Fabry-P\u00e9rot or distributed feedback lasers for operation in the longer IR wavelength range. Several other laser types are suitable for high performance FSO systems. \\n     A free-space optics system using orbital angular momentum processing and multi-layer overlay modulation would provide a number of advantages. The system would be very convenient. Free-space optics provides a wireless solution to a last-mile connection, or a connection between two buildings. There is no necessity to dig or bury fiber cable. Free-space optics also requires no RF license. The system is upgradable and its open interfaces support equipment from a variety of vendors. The system can be deployed behind windows, eliminating the need for costly rooftop sites. Further, it is easier to deploy in buildings as the system can be located as the area requires, saving significant costs of running cables to rooftops. It is also immune to radiofrequency interference or saturation. The system is also fairly speedy. The system provides 10 Gigabits per second of data throughput. This provides ample bandwidth to transfer files between two sites. With the growth in the size of files, free-space optics provides the necessary bandwidth to transfer these files efficiently. \\n     Free-space optics also provides a secure wireless solution. The laser beam cannot be detected with a spectral analyzer or RF meter. The beam is invisible, which makes it difficult to find. The laser beam that is used to transmit and receive the data is very narrow. This means that it is almost impossible to intercept the data being transmitted. One would have to be within the line of sight between the receiver and the transmitter in order to be able to accomplish this feat. If this occurs, this would alert the receiving site that a connection has been lost or the amount of signal received severely diminished. Thus, minimal security upgrades would be required for a free-space optics system. \\n     However, there are several weaknesses with free-space optics systems. The distance of a free-space optics system is very limited. Currently operating distances are approximately within 2 kilometers. Although this is a powerful system with great throughput, the limitation of distance is a big deterrent for full-scale implementation. Further, the more OAMs applied, the greater divergence over distance. Additionally, all systems require line of sight be maintained at all times during transmission. Any obstacle, be it environmental or animals can hinder the transmission. Free-space optic technology must be designed to combat changes in the atmosphere which can affect free-space optic system performance capacity. Finally, any shift in the mounting apparatus can cause the beam to be misaligned. Shifts can be caused by wind, earthquakes, ground shifting and even traffic. \\n     Referring now to  FIGS. 25A through 25D , in order to achieve higher data capacity within optical links, an additional degree of freedom from multiplexing multiple data channels must be exploited. Moreover, the ability to use two different orthogonal multiplexing techniques together has the potential to dramatically enhance system performance and increased bandwidth. \\n     One multiplexing technique which may exploit the possibilities is mode division multiplexing (MDM) using orbital angular momentum (OAM). OAM mode refers to laser beams within a free-space optical system or fiber-optic system that have a phase term of e il\u03c6  in their wave fronts, in which \u03c6 is the azimuth angle and   determines the OAM value (topological charge). In general, OAM modes have a \u201cdonut-like\u201d ring shaped intensity distribution. Multiple spatial collocated laser beams, which carry different OAM values, are orthogonal to each other and can be used to transmit multiple independent data channels on the same wavelength. Consequently, the system capacity and spectral efficiency in terms of bits/S/Hz can be dramatically increased. Free-space communications links using OAM may support 100 Tbits/capacity. Various techniques for implementing this as illustrated in  FIGS. 25A through 25D  include a combination of multiple beams  2502  having multiple different OAM values  2504  on each wavelength. Thus, beam  2502  includes OAM values, OAM 1  and OAM 4 . Beam  2506  includes OAM value 2 and OAM value 5. Finally, beam  2508  includes OAM 3  value and OAM 6  value. Referring now to  FIG. 25B , there is illustrated a single beam wavelength  2510  using a first group of OAM values  2512  having both a positive OAM value  2512  and a negative OAM value  2514 . Similarly, OAM 2  value may have a positive value  2516  and a negative value  2518  on the same wavelength  2510 . While mode division multiplexing of OAM modes is described above, other orthogonal functions may be used with mode division multiplexing such as Laguerre Gaussian functions, Hermite Gaussian functions, Jacobi functions, Gegenbauer functions, Legendre functions and Chebyshev functions. \\n       FIG. 25C  illustrates the use of a wavelength  2520  having polarization multiplexing of OAM value. The wavelength  2520  can have multiple OAM values  2522  multiplexed thereon. The number of available channels can be further increased by applying left or right handed polarization to the OAM values. Finally,  FIG. 25D  illustrates two groups of concentric rings  2560 ,  2562  for a wavelength having multiple OAM values. \\n     Another multiplexing technique is wavelength distribution multiplexing (WDM), WDM has been widely used to improve the optical communication capacity within both fiber-optic systems and free-space communication system. Combining OAM and WDM has not previously been done. However, OAM mode multiplexing and WDM are mutually orthogonal such that they can be combined to achieve a dramatic increase in system capacity. Referring now to  FIG. 26 , there is illustrated a scenario where each WDM channel  2602  contains many orthogonal OAM beam  2604 . Thus, using a combination of orbital angular momentum with wave division multiplexing, a significant enhancement in communication link to capacity may be achieved. \\n     Current optical communication architectures have considerable routing challenges. A routing protocol for use with free-space optic system must take into account the line of sight requirements for optical communications within a free-space optics system. However, an optics network may be modeled as a directed hierarchical random sector geometric graph in which sensors route their data via multi-hop paths to a base station through a cluster head. This technique is a new efficient routing algorithm for local neighborhood discovery and a base station uplink and downlink discovery algorithm. The routing protocol requires order O log(n) storage at each node versus order O(n) used within current techniques and architectures. This new technique has the advantage of being much faster than current systems. \\n     Current routing protocols are based on link state, distance vectors, path vectors, or source routing, and they differ from the new routing technique in significant manners. First, current techniques assume that a fraction of the links are bidirectional. This is not true within a free-space optic network in which links are unidirectional. Second, many current protocols are designed for ad hoc networks in which the routing protocol is designed to support multi-hop communications between any pair of nodes. The goal of the sensor network is to route sensor readings to the base station. Therefore, the dominant traffic patterns are different from those in an ad hoc network. In a sensor network, node to base stations, base station to nodes, and local neighborhood communication are mostly used. \\n     Many paths of wireless and free space network are unidirectional. Recent studies on wireless and free space optical systems show that as many as 5 percent to 10 percent of links and wireless ad hoc networks are unidirectional due to various factors. Routing protocols such as DSDV and AODV use a reverse path technique, implicitly ignoring such unidirectional links and are therefore not relevant in this scenario. Other protocols such as DSR, ZRP, or ZRL have been designed or modified to accommodate unidirectionality by detecting unidirectional links and then providing bidirectional abstraction for such links. Unidirectionality only allows information transmission in a single direction which does not enable a response to be provided to an information transmission system. Referring now to  FIG. 27 , one solution for dealing with unidirectionality is tunneling, in which bidirectionality is emulated for a unidirectional link by using bidirectional links on a reverse back channel to establish the tunnel. Tunneling also prevents implosion of acknowledgement packets and looping by simply pressing link layer acknowledgements for tunneled packets received on a unidirectional link. Tunneling, however, works well in mostly bidirectional networks with few unidirectional links. \\n     Within a network using only unidirectional links such as a free-space optical network, systems such as that illustrated in  FIGS. 27 and 28  would be more applicable. Nodes within a unidirectional network utilize a directional transmit  2702  transmitting from the node  2700  in a single, defined direction. Additionally, each node  2700  includes an omnidirectional receiver  2704  which can receive a signal coming to the node in any direction. Also, as discussed here and above, the node  2700  would also include a O log(n) storage  2706 . Thus, each node  2700  provide only unidirectional communications links. Thus, a series of nodes  2700  as illustrated in  FIG. 28  may unidirectionally communicate with any other node  2700  and forward communication from one location to another through a sequence of interconnected nodes. \\n     Multiplexing of the topological charge to the RF as well as free space optics in real time provides redundancy and better capacity. When channel impairments from atmospheric disturbances or scintillation impact the information signals, it is possible to toggle between free space optics to RF and back in real time. This approach still uses twisted waves on both the free space optics as well as the RF signal. Most of the channel impairments can be detected using a control or pilot channel and be corrected using algorithmic techniques (closed loop control system) or by toggling between the RF and free space optics. \\n     Topological charge may be multiplexed to the wave length for either linear or circular polarization. In the case of linear polarizations, topological charge would be multiplexed on vertical and horizontal polarization. In case of circular polarization, topological charge would be multiplexed on left hand and right hand circular polarizations. \\n     The topological charges can be created using Spiral Phase Plates (SPPs) such as that illustrated in  FIG. 11E , phase mask holograms or a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) by adjusting the voltages on SLM which creates properly varying index of refraction resulting in twisting of the beam with a specific topological charge. Different topological charges can be created and muxed together and de-muxed to separate charges. \\n     As Spiral Phase plates can transform a plane wave ( =0) to a twisted wave of a specific helicity (i.e.  =+1), Quarter Wave Plates (QWP) can transform a linear polarization (s=0) to circular polarization (i.e. s=+1). \\n     Cross talk and multipath interference can be reduced using Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO). \\n     Most of the channel impairments can be detected using a control or pilot channel and be corrected using algorithmic techniques (closed loop control system). \\n     In a further embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 29 , both RF signals and free space optics may be implemented within a dual RF and free space optics mechanism  2902 . The dual RF and free space optics mechanism  2902  include a free space optics projection portion  2904  that transmits a light wave having an orbital angular momentum applied thereto with multilevel overlay modulation and a RF portion  2906  including circuitry necessary for transmitting information with orbital angular momentum and multilayer overlay on an RF signal  2910 . The dual RF and free space optics mechanism  2902  may be multiplexed in real time between the free space optics signal  2908  and the RF signal  2910  depending upon operating conditions. In some situations, the free space optics signal  2908  would be most appropriate for transmitting the data. In other situations, the free space optics signal  2908  would not be available and the RF signal  2910  would be most appropriate for transmitting data. The dual RF and free space optics mechanism  2902  may multiplex in real time between these two signals based upon the available operating conditions. \\n     Multiplexing of the topological charge to the RF as well as free space optics in real time provides redundancy and better capacity. When channel impairments from atmospheric disturbances or scintillation impact the information signals, it is possible to toggle between free space optics to RF and back in real time. This approach still uses twisted waves on both the free space optics as well as the RF signal. Most of the channel impairments can be detected using a control or pilot channel and be corrected using algorithmic techniques (closed loop control system) or by toggling between the RF and free space optics. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 30 , there is illustrated a further manner for generating a light beam  3002  including orthogonal functions such as OAM, Hermite Gaussian, Laguerre Gaussian, etc., therein to encode information in the beam. The laser beam generator  3004  generates a beam  3006  including plane waves that is provided to a MicroElectroMechanical system (MEMs) device  3008 . Examples of MEMs devices  3008  include digital light processing (DLP) projectors or digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs) that enable the generation of light beams having various characteristics. A MEMs device  3008  can generate Hermite Gaussian (HG) modes, Laguerre Gaussian (LG) modes and vortex OAM modes that are programmed responsive to inputs to the MEMs device  3008 . The MEMs device  3008  has mode selection logic  3010  that enable selection of the Laguerre Gaussian, Hermite Gaussian and vortex OAM modes (or other orthogonal function modes) for processing of the incoming light beam  3006 . The MEMs device  3008  further enables switching between the different modes at a very high rate of a few thousand times per second which is not achievable using spatial light modulator (SLMs). Switching between the modes is controlled via mode switching logic  3012 . This fast switching enables these forms of OAM, HG or LG mode generation for communications as well as quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum computers for quantum information processing. The orthogonal characteristics of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) with OAM and Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams combined with high-speed switching of MEMs make the device useful in achieving higher data capacity. This is possible using holograms that are programmed into the memory of a DLP that program micro-mirrors to selected positions and can twist a light beam with programmed information using the mirrors. \\n     This enables the on-demand realization of binary gratings (holograms) that can be switched between at very high speed using an external digital signal. Using, for example, DLP technologies, a switch between different modes (different binary gratings) may be achieved at a very high rate of speed of a few thousand times per second which is not achievable using spatial light modulators (SLMs). This allows for the dynamic control of helicities provided to a beam of light for a new modulation and/or multiple access technique to encode information. \\n     DLP&#39;s allow for high resolution and accuracy from micrometers to millimeters thus enabling a variety of frequencies from infrared to ultraviolet to be utilized. The use of DLP&#39;s for MDM (mode division multiplexing) minimizes color, distance, movement and environmental sensitivity and is thus ideal for building integrated optics. The majority of SLM&#39;s are limited by a frame refresh rate of about 60 Hz which makes the high speed, wide range of operational spectral bandwidth of digital micro-mirror devices (DMD&#39;s) useful in a variety of applications. DMD designs inherently minimize temperature sensitivity for reliable 3-D wave construction. \\n     The vast majority of commercially available SLM devices are limited to frame rate of about 60 Hz which considerably limits the speed of operation of any system based on this technology. A DMD is an amplitude only spatial light modulator. The high speed, wide range of operational spectral bandwidth and high power threshold of a DMDs makes the device a useful tool for variety of applications. Variations of DMD&#39;s are commercially available for a fraction of the cost of a phase only SLM. Intensity shaping of spatial modes can be achieved by switching the micro mirrors on and off rapidly. However, the modes created during this process may not be temporally stable and have the desired intensity profile only when averaged by a slow detector. \\n     Phase and amplitude information may be encoded by modulating the position and width of a binary amplitude grating implemented within a hologram such as those illustrated in  FIGS. 31A-31H . By implementing such holograms to control a DMD, HG modes, LG modes, OAM vortex modes or any angular (ANG) mode may be created by properly programming the DMD with a hologram. Additionally, the switching between the generated modes may be performed at a very high speed. \\n     This approach may be realized by considering a one-dimensional binary amplitude grating. The transmission function for this grating can be written as: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \u03c4 \\n               \\ue8a0 \\n               \\n                 ( \\n                 x \\n                 ) \\n               \\n             \\n             = \\n             \\n               \\n                 \u2211 \\n                 \\n                   n \\n                   = \\n                   \\n                     - \\n                     \u221e \\n                   \\n                 \\n                 \u221e \\n               \\n               \\ue89e \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\ue89e \\n               \\n                 \u220f \\n                 \\n                   [ \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       x \\n                       - \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           ( \\n                           \\n                             n \\n                             + \\n                             k \\n                           \\n                           ) \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                           x \\n                           0 \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     \\n                       wx \\n                       0 \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   ] \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     where \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \u220f \\n               \\n                 ( \\n                 v \\n                 ) \\n               \\n             \\n             = \\n             \\n               \\n                 Rect \\n                 \\ue8a0 \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   v \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n               = \\n               \\n                 { \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       1 \\n                     \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           if \\n                           \\ue89e \\n                           \\n                               \\n                           \\n                           \\ue89e \\n                           \\n                             \\uf603 \\n                             v \\n                             \\uf604 \\n                           \\n                         \\n                         \u2264 \\n                         1 \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       0 \\n                     \\n                     \\n                       else \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n                 } \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     This function can be pictured as a pulse train with a period of x 0 . The parameters of \u201ck\u201d and \u201cw\u201d are unitless quantities that set the position and the width of each pulse and are equal to constant values for a uniform grating. It is possible to locally change the value of these parameters to achieve phase and amplitude modulations of the optical field. The transmittance function \u03c4(x) is a periodic function and can be expanded as a Fourier series. \\n     In a case where k(x) and w(x) are functions of x and the binary grating is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave.

Therefore, the phase and the amplitude of the diffracted light can be controlled by setting the parameters k(x) and w(x). In communication theory, these methods are sometimes referred to as pulse position modulation (PPM) and pulse width modulation (PWM). The equation above is a good approximation for slowly varying k(x) and w(x) functions. \\n     The above analysis treats a one-dimensional case.

The gratings holograms designed for vortex modes would have a fairly uniform width across the aperture whereas for the case of LG modes, the gratings gradually disappear when the amplitude gets negligibly small. \\n     A digital micro-mirror device (DMD) is an amplitude only spatial light modulator. The device consist of an array of micro mirrors that can be controlled in a binary fashion by setting the deflection angle of an individual mirror to either +12\u00b0 or \u221212\u00b0. Referring now to  FIG. 32A , there is illustrated a general block diagram of a DMD  3202 . The DMD  3202  includes a plurality of micro-mirrors  3208  arranged in an X by Y array. The array may comprise a 1024\u00d7768 array of aluminum micro-mirrors such as that implemented in the DLP  5500  DMD Array. However, it will be appreciated that other array sizes and DMD devices may be used. Each micro-mirror  3208  includes a combination of opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical elements. Each micro-mirror  3208  comprises a pixel of the DMD  3202 . The micro-mirror  3208  is an electromechanical element having two stable micro-mirror states of +12\u00b0 and \u221212\u00b0. The micro-mirrors have a 10.8 micrometer pitch and are designed for light having a wavelength of 420 nm-700 nm. The state of the micro-mirror  3208  is determined by the geometry and electrostatics of the pixel during operation. The two positions of the micro-mirror  3208  determine the direction that the light beam striking the mirror is deflected. In particular, the DMD  3202  is a spatial light modulator. By convention, the positive (+) state is tilted toward the illumination and is referred to as the \u201con\u201d state. Similarly, the negative (\u2212) state is tilted away from the illumination and is referred to as the \u201coff\u201d state. \\n       FIG. 32B  illustrates the manner in which a micro-mirror  3208  will interact with a light source  3230  such as a laser. The light source  3230  shines a beam along angle of \u221224\u00b0 that strikes the micro-mirror  3208 . When the mirror is in the \u201coff\u201d state  3232  at an angle of \u221212\u00b0, the off state energy  3234  is reflected at an angle of 48\u00b0. When the mirror  3208  is positioned at the flat state  3236  of 0\u00b0, the flat state energy  3238  is reflected in an angle of 24\u00b0. Finally, when the mirror is at +12\u00b0 in the \u201con\u201d state  3240 , the on state energy  3242  is reflected at 0\u00b0 through the projection lens  3244  of a DMD. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 33 , there is illustrated a view of the mechanical structure of a micro-mirror  3208 . The micro-mirror  3208  includes the mirror  3302  attached to a torsional hinge  3304  along a diagonal axis  3306  of the mirror. The underside of the micro-mirror  3302  makes electrical contact with the remainder of the circuitry via spring tips  3308 . A pair of electrodes  3310  is used for holding the micro-mirror  3302  in one of the two operational positions (+12\u00b0 and \u221212\u00b0). \\n     Referring now also to  FIG. 34 , there is illustrated a block diagram of the functional components of the micro-mirror  3208 . Below each micro-mirror  3208  is a memory cell  3402  consisting of dual CMOS memory elements  3404 . The states of the two memory elements  3404  are not independent, but are always complementary. If one CMOS memory element  3404  is at a logical \u201c1\u201d level, the other CMOS element is at a logical \u201c0\u201d and vice versa. The state of the memory cell  3402  of the micro-mirror  3208  plays a part in the mechanical position of the mirror  3208 . However, loading information within the memory cell  3402  does not automatically change the mechanical state of the micro-mirror  3208 . \\n     Although the state of the dual CMOS memory elements  3404  plays a part in determining the state of the micro-mirror  3208 , the state of the memory elements  3304  is not the sole determining factor. Once the micro-mirror  3208  has landed, changing the state of the memory cells  3402  will not cause the micro-mirror  3208  to flip to the other state. Thus, the memory state and the micro-mirror state are not directly linked together. In order for the state of the CMOS memory elements  3404  to be transferred to the mechanical position of the micro-mirror  3208 , the micro-mirror  3108  must receive a \u201cMirror Clocking Pulse\u201d signal. The mirror clocking pulse signal momentarily releases the micro-mirror  3108  and causes the mirror to reposition based on the state of the CMOS memory elements  3304 . Thus, information relating to mirror positions may be preloaded into the memory element  3404 , and the mechanical position of the mirror  3302  for each mirror within a MEMs device  3202  simultaneously change responsive to the mirror clocking pulse signal. One manner in which the information within the memory cells  3402  may be programmed is through the use of holograms, such as those described herein that are used to defined the position of each of the micro-mirrors  3208  with and a MEMs device  3202 . \\n     When a DMD  3202  is \u201cpowered up\u201d or \u201cpowered down,\u201d there are prescribed operations that are necessary to ensure the proper orientation of the micro-mirrors  3208 . These operations position the micro-mirrors  3208  during power up and release them during power down. The process for changing the position of a micro-mirror  3208  is more particularly illustrated in the flowchart of  FIG. 35 . Initially, at step  3502 , the memory states within the memory cells  3402  are set. Once the memory states have been set within the memory cells  3402 , the mirror clock pulse signal may be applied at step  3504 . The micro-mirror  3108  will have an established specification of the time before and after a mirror clocking pulse that data may be loaded into the memory cell  3402 . Application of the mirror clocking pulse signal will then set the mirrors to their new state established by the memory at step  3506 . The process is completed at step  3508 , and the mirror  3302  position is fixed and new data may be loaded into the memory cell  3402 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 36 , there is illustrated an intensity and phase interferometer for measuring the intensity and phase of the generated beam. One can generate spatial modes by loading computer-generated Matlab holograms  3602  such as those described herein above and illustrated in  FIGS. 31A-31H  onto a DMD memory. The holograms  3602  for generating modes can be created by modulating a grating function with 20 micro-mirrors per each period. The holograms  3602  are provided to a DMD  3604 . An imaging system  3606  along with an aperture  3608  separates the first order diffracted light into separate modes. The imaging system includes a laser  3610  that provides a light through a pair of lenses  3612 ,  3614 . The lens  3612  expands the light beam to lens  3614  which collimates the beam. A beam splitter  3616  splits the beam toward a lens  3618  and mirror  3621 . Lens  3618  focuses the beam through lens  3620  which collimates the beam through a filter  3622 . The filtered beam is reflected by mirror  3624  through a second beam splitter  3626 . The beam splitter  3626  splits the beam toward a lens  3628  and a charge coupled device camera  3630 . The charge coupled device (CCD) camera  3630  measures the intensity profile of the generated beam. The plane wave beam provided to lens  3628  is focused on to the aperture  3608  to interfere with the twisted beam from the DMD. Also focused on the aperture  3608  is the twisted beam from the DMD  3604 . The beam from the DMD  3604  is provided through a lens  3632  that also focuses on the aperture  3608 . The phase of the mode being generated is determined from the number of spirals in the pattern and is caused by interfering the twisted beam with a plane wave beam. Also, whether the phase is positive or negative may be determined by whether the spirals are clockwise (positive) or counter-clockwise (negative). A Mach-Zehnder interferometer may be used to verify the phase pattern of the created beams. The collimated plane wave provided from lens  3628  is interfered with the modes generated by the beam from the DMD  3604  through lens  3632 . This generates the interferograms (spiral patterns) at the aperture  3608 . The modes generated from the DMD may then be multiplexed together using memory-based static forks on the DLP. \\n     Therefore, there is a possibility of using binary holograms to coherently control both phase and amplitude of a light beam. A low number of pixels per each period of the binary grating results in quantization errors in encoding phase and intensity. The total number of grating periods with in the incident beam on the DMD  3604  sets an upper limit on the spatial bandwidth of the generated modes. Consequently a large number of micro-mirrors is preferable for generating high-quality modes. This can be achieved by using newer generations of DMDs. Another set of modes that are needed for OAM-based quantum key distribution is the set of angular (ANG) modes. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 37 , there is illustrated the manner in which switching between different OAM modes may be achieved in real time. The laser  3702  generates a collimated beam through lenses  3704  and  3706  to a DMD  3708 . The DMD  3708  provides a beam that is focused by lens  3710  onto aperture  3712 . The output from the aperture  3712  is provided to a lens  3714  that collimates the beam onto a mirror  3716 . The collimated beam is provided to an OAM sorter  3718  that separates the signal into various OAM modes  3720  as detected by a computer  3722 . \\n     Using DMDs for generating OAM modes provides the ability to switch between different modes at very high speeds. This involves a much smaller number of optical elements as compared to the conventional techniques were OAM modes are generated using a series of separated forked holograms and are multiplexed using beam splitters. Therefore, one can achieve dynamic switching among vortex OAM modes with different quantum numbers. The computer-generated holograms for these modes must be loaded onto the memory of the DMD  3708 , and the switching is achieved by using a clock signal. One can use a mode sorter to map the input modes to a series of separated spots. The intensity may then be measured corresponding to each mode using a high-bandwidth PIN detector at positions corresponding to each mode. The DMD devices are available for a fraction of the cost of phase only spatial light modulators. \\n     The DMD efficiency observed in a specific application depends on application-specific design variables such as illumination wavelength, illumination angle, projection aperture size, overfill of the DMD micro-mirror array and so on. Overall optical efficiency of each DMD can generally be estimated as a product of window transmission, a diffraction efficiency, micro-mirror surface reflectivity and array fill factor. The first three factors depend on the wavelength of the illumination source. \\n     DLP technology uses two types of materials for DMD mirrors. The mirror material for all DMD&#39;s except Type-A is Corning Eagle XG, whereas type A DMDs use Corning 7056. Both mirror types have an anti-reflectivity (AR), thin-film coating on both the top and the bottom of the window glass material. AR coatings reduce reflections and increase transmission efficiency. The DMD mirrors are designed for three transmission regions. These ranges include the ultraviolet light region from 300 nm to 400 nm, the visible light region from 400 nm to 700 nm and the near infrared light region (NIR) from 700 nm to 2500 nm. The coating used depends on the application. UV windows have special AR coatings designed to be more transmissive for ultraviolet wavelengths, visible coatings for visible DMDs and NIR coatings for NIR DMDs. \\n     The measured data provided in the following sections reflects a typical single pass transmittance through both top and bottom AR coated mirror surfaces with random polarization. The angle of incidence (AOI) of 0\u00b0 is measured perpendicular to the window surface unless mentioned otherwise. With an increase in the number of window passes, the efficiency would decline. \\n       FIG. 38  represents the window transmission curves for Corning 7056. The window transmission response curve in this figure applies to Taipei MDM&#39;s in their specified illumination wavelength regions.  FIG. 38  shows the UV window transmittance measured perpendicular to the window surface and visible window transmittance at a lie of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0.  FIGS. 39-43  are zoomed in views of the typical visible and UV AR coated window transmittance in their maximum transmission regions. The visible Corning Eagle XG window transmission data shown in  FIG. 42  applies to the DLP  5500 , DLP  1700 , DLP  3000  and DLP  3000  DMD&#39;s. The typical transmittance observed in these DMD&#39;s is broadband visible region is approximately 97%. The NIR Corning Eagle XG window transmission data of  FIG. 43  applies to the DLP  3000  NIR DMD. The typical transmittance observed in the NIR DMD&#39;s in the broadband NIR region is approximately 96% for most of the region with a dip toward 90% as it nears 2500 nm. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 44 , there is illustrated a configuration of generation circuitry for the generation of an OAM twisted beam using a hologram within a micro-electrical mechanical device. A laser  4402  generates a beam having a wavelength of approximately 543 nm. This beam is focused through a telescope  4404  and lens  4406  onto a mirror/system of mirrors  4408 . The beam is reflected from the mirrors  4408  into a DMD  4410 . The DMD  4410  has programmed in to its memory a one or more forked holograms  4412  that generate a desired OAM twisted beam  4413  having any desired information encoded into the OAM modes of the beam that is detected by a CCD  4414 . The holograms  4412  are loaded into the memory of the DMD  4410  and displayed as a static image. In the case of 1024\u00d7768 DMD array, the images must comprise 1024 by 768 images. The control software of the DMD  4410  converts the holograms into .bmp files. The holograms may be displayed singly or as multiple holograms displayed together in order to multiplex particular OAM modes onto a single beam. The manner of generating the hologram  4412  within the DMD  4410  may be implemented in a number of fashions that provide qualitative differences between the generated OAM beam  4413 . Phase and amplitude information may be encoded into a beam by modulating the position and width of a binary amplitude grating used as a hologram. By realizing such holograms on a DMD the creation of HG modes, LG modes, OAM vortex mode or any angular mode may be realized. Furthermore, by performing switching of the generated modes at a very high speed, information may be encoded within the helicity&#39;s that are dynamically changing to provide a new type of helicity modulation. Spatial modes may be generated by loading computer-generated holograms onto a DMD. These holograms can be created by modulating a grating function with 20 micro mirrors per each period. \\n     Rather than just generating an OAM beam  4413  having only a single OAM value included therein, multiple OAM values may be multiplexed into the OAM beam in a variety of manners as described herein below. The use of multiple OAM values allows for the incorporation of different information into the light beam. Programmable structured light provided by the DLP allows for the projection of custom and adaptable patterns. These patterns may be programmed into the memory of the DLP and used for imparting different information through the light beam. Furthermore, if these patterns are clocked dynamically a modulation scheme may be created where the information is encoded in the helicities of the structured beams. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 45 , rather than just having the laser beam  4502  shine on a single hologram multiple holograms  4504  may be generated by the DMD  4410 .  FIG. 45  illustrates an implementation wherein a 4\u00d73 array of holograms  4504  are generated by the DMD  4410 . The holograms  4504  are square and each edge of a hologram lines up with an edge of an adjacent hologram to create the 4\u00d73 array. The OAM values provided by each of the holograms  4504  are multiplexed together by shining the beam  4502  onto the array of holograms  4504 . Several configurations of the holograms  4504  may be used in order to provide differing qualities of the OAM beam  4413  and associated modes generated by passing a light beam through the array of holograms  4504 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 46  there is illustrated an alternative way of multiplexing various OAM modes together. An X by Y array of holograms  4602  has each of the hologram  4602  placed upon a black (dark) background  4604  in order to segregate the various modes from each other. In another configuration illustrated in  FIG. 47 , the holograms  4702  are placed in a hexagonal configuration with the background in the off (black) state in order to better segregate the modes. \\n       FIG. 48  illustrates yet another technique for multiplexing multiple OAM modes together wherein the holograms  4802  are cycled through in a loop sequence by the DMD  4410 . In this example modes T 0 -T 11  are cycled through and the process repeats by returning back to mode T 0 . This process repeats in a continuous loop in order to provide an OAM twisted beam with each of the modes multiplex therein. \\n     In addition to providing integer OAM modes using holograms within the DMD, fractional OAM modes may also be presented by the DMD using fractional binary forks as illustrated in  FIG. 49 .  FIG. 49  illustrates fractional binary forks for generating fractional OAM modes of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.25, 1.50 and 1.75 with a light beam. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 50-63 , there are illustrated the results achieved from various configurations of holograms program within the memory of a DMD.  FIG. 50  illustrates the configuration at  5002  having no hologram separation on a white background producing the OAM mode image  5004 .  FIG. 51  uses a configuration  5102  consisting of circular holograms  5004  having separation on a white background. The OAM mode image  5006  that is provided therefrom is also illustrated. Bright mode separation yields less light and better mode separation. \\n       FIG. 52  illustrates a configuration  5202  having square holograms with no separation on a black background. The configuration  5202  generates the OAM mode image  5204 .  FIG. 53  illustrates the configuration of circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) that are separated on a black background. This yields the OAM mode image  5304 . Dark mode separation yields more light in the OAM image  5304  and has slightly better mode separation. \\n       FIG. 54  illustrates a configuration  5402  having a bright background and circular hologram (radius \u02dc256 pixels) separation yielding an OAM mode image  5404 .  FIG. 55  illustrates a configuration  5502  using circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) having separation on a black background to yield the OAM mode image  5504 . The dark mode separation yields more light and has a slightly worse mode separation within the OAM mode images. \\n       FIG. 56  illustrates a configuration  5602  including circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a bright background yielding an OAM mode image  5604 .  FIG. 57  illustrates at  5702  small circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a bright background that yields and OAM mode image  5704 . The larger holograms with brighter backgrounds yield better OAM mode separation images. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 58 , there is illustrated a configuration  5802  of circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a dark background with each of the holograms having a radius of approximately 256 pixels. This configuration  5802  yields the OAM mode image  5804 .  FIG. 59  illustrates the use of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) having a radius of approximately 190 pixels arranged in a hexagonal distribution on a black background that yields the OAM mode image  5904 . Larger holograms (radius of approximately 256 pixels) having a dark background yields worse OAM mode separation within the OAM mode images. \\n       FIG. 60  illustrates a configuration  6002  of small holograms (radius of approximately 190 pixels) in a hexagonal separated distribution on a dark background that yields the OAM mode image  6004 .  FIG. 61  illustrates a configuration  6102  of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution that are close together on a dark background that yields the OAM mode image  6104 . The larger dark boundaries ( FIG. 60 ) yield worse OAM mode image separation than a smaller dark boundary. \\n       FIG. 62  illustrates a configuration  6202  of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a separated hexagonal configuration on a bright background yielding OAM mode image  6204 .  FIG. 63  illustrates a configuration  6302  of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) more closely spaced in a hexagonal configuration on a bright background yielding OAM mode image  6304 . The larger bright boundaries ( FIG. 62 ) yield a better OAM mode separation. \\n     Additional illustrations of holograms, namely reduced binary holograms are illustrated in  FIGS. 64-67 .  FIG. 64  illustrates reduced binary holograms having a radius equal to 100 micro mirrors and a period of 50 for various OAM modes. Similarly, OAM modes are illustrated for reduced binary for holograms having a radius of 50 micro mirrors and a period of 50 ( FIG. 65 ); a radius of 100 micro mirrors and a period of 100 ( FIG. 66 ) and a radius of 50 micro mirrors and a period of 50 ( FIG. 67 ). \\n     The illustrated data with respect to the holograms of  FIGS. 50-67  demonstrates that full forked gratings yield a great deal of scattered light. Finer forked gratings yield better define modes within OAM images. By removing unnecessary light from the hologram (white regions) there is a reduction in scatter. Holograms that are larger and have fewer features (more dark zones) having a hologram diameter of 200 micro mirrors provide overlapping modes and strong intensity. Similar configurations using 100 micro mirrors also demonstrate overlapping modes and strong intensity. Smaller holograms having smaller radii between 100-200 micro mirrors and periods between 50 and 100 generated by a DLP produce better defined modes and have stronger intensity than larger holograms with larger radii in periods. Smaller holograms having more features (dark zones with hologram diameters of 200 micro mirrors provide well-defined modes with strong intensity. However, hundred micro mirror diameter holograms while providing well-defined modes provide weaker intensity. Thus, good, compact hologram sizes are between 100-200 micro mirrors with zone periods of between 50 and 100. Larger holograms have been shown to provide a richer OAM topology. \\n     Additional methods of providing multimode OAM generation by implementing multiple holograms within a MEMs device are illustrated in  FIG. 68 . These configurations of holograms illustrate the hologram configurations and associated OAM mode images for mode combinations from l=1 to l=1,2,3,4,5,6,7. \\n     In addition to the binary forked holograms discussed hereinabove, the Matlab capability of the DMD also enables the generation of binary spiral holograms of differing mode levels.  FIG. 69  illustrates binary spiral holograms for l=1 and l=20. \\n     It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that this system and method for applying orthogonal limitations to light beams using microelectromechanical systems provides improved mode data transmission capability.

<heading id=\"h-0004\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers are used herein to designate like elements throughout, the various views and embodiments of system and method for communication using orbital angular momentum with modulation are illustrated and described, and other possible embodiments are described. The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated and/or simplified in places for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations based on the following examples of possible embodiments.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a general overview of the manner for providing improved spectral efficiency within various communication protocol interfaces <b>102</b>, using a combination of multiple level overlay modulation <b>104</b> and the application of orbital angular momentum <b>106</b> to increase the number of communications channels.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">The various communication protocol interfaces <b>102</b> may be comprised of a variety of system links using the electromagnetic spectrum, such as RF, cable or twisted pair, or optical making use of light wavelengths such as fiber-optic communications or free-space optics. Various types of RF communications may include a combination of RF microwave, RF satellite communication, nomadic and mobile wireless systems, as well as multiplexing between RF and free-space optics in real time.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">By combining a multiple layer overlay modulation technique <b>104</b> with orbital angular momentum (OAM) technique <b>106</b>, a higher throughput over various types of system <b>102</b> may be achieved. The use of multiple level overlay modulation alone without OAM increases the spectral efficiency of systems <b>102</b>, whether wired, optical, or wireless. However, together with OAM, the increase in spectral efficiency is even more significant.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">Multiple overlay modulation techniques <b>104</b> provide a new degree of freedom beyond the conventional 2 degrees of freedom, with time T and frequency F being independent variables in a two-dimensional notational space defining orthogonal axes in an information diagram. This comprises a more general approach rather than modeling signals as fixed in either the frequency or time domain. Previous modeling methods using fixed time or fixed frequency are considered to be more limiting cases of the general approach of using multiple level overlay modulation <b>104</b>. Within the multiple level overlay modulation technique <b>104</b>, signals may be differentiated in two-dimensional space rather than along a single axis. Thus, the information-carrying capacity and/or spectral efficiency of a system may be determined by a number of signals which occupy different time and frequency coordinates and may be differentiated in a notational two-dimensional space.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">Within the notational two-dimensional space, minimization of the time bandwidth product, i.e., the area occupied by a signal in that space, enables denser packing, and thus, the use of more signals, with higher resulting information-carrying capacity and/or spectral efficiency, within a fixed bandwidth. Given the frequency bandwidth delta (\u0394f), a given signal transmitted through it in minimum time \u0394t will have an envelope described by certain time-bandwidth minimizing signals. The time-bandwidth products for these signals take the form;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0000\"> <br/>\u0394<i>t\u0394f=</i>\u00bd(2<i>n+</i>1)\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0000\">where n is an integer ranging from 0 to infinity, denoting the order of the signal.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0094\">These signals form an orthogonal set of infinite elements, where each has a finite amount of energy. They are finite in both the time domain and the frequency domain, and can be detected from a mix of other signals and noise through correlation, for example, by match filtering. Unlike other wavelets, these orthogonal signals have similar time and frequency forms.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0095\">The orbital angular momentum process <b>106</b> provides a twist to wave fronts of the electromagnetic fields carrying the data stream that may enable the transmission of multiple data streams on the same frequency, wavelength, or other signal-supporting mechanism. This will increase the bandwidth over a system by allowing a single frequency or wavelength to support multiple eigen channels, each of the individual channels having a different orthogonal and independent orbital angular momentum associated therewith.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0096\">In one embodiment, referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated a further communication implementation technique using the above described techniques as twisted pairs or cables carry electrons (not photons). Rather than using each of the multiple level overlay modulation <b>104</b> and orbital angular momentum techniques <b>106</b>, only the multiple level overlay modulation <b>104</b> can be used in conjunction with a single wireline interface and, more particularly, a twisted pair communication link or a cable communication link <b>202</b>. The operation of the multiple level overlay modulation <b>204</b>, is similar to that discussed previously with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, but is used by itself without the use of orbital angular momentum techniques <b>106</b>, and is used with either a twisted pair communication link or cable interface communication link <b>202</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0097\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated a general block diagram for processing a plurality of data streams <b>302</b> for transmission in an optical communication system. The multiple data streams <b>302</b> are provided to the multi-layer overlay modulation circuitry <b>304</b> wherein the signals are modulated using the multi-layer overlay modulation technique. The modulated signals are provided to orbital angular momentum processing circuitry <b>306</b> which applies a twist to each of the wave fronts being transmitted on the wavelengths of the optical communication channel. The twisted waves are transmitted through the optical interface <b>308</b> over an optical communications link such as an optical fiber or free space optics communication system. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> may also illustrate an RF mechanism wherein the interface <b>308</b> would comprise and RF interface rather than an optical interface.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0098\">Referring now more particularly to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated a functional block diagram of a system for generating the orbital angular momentum \u201ctwist\u201d within a communication system, such as that illustrated with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, to provide a data stream that may be combined with multiple other data streams for transmission upon a same wavelength or frequency. Multiple data streams <b>402</b> are provided to the transmission processing circuitry <b>400</b>. Each of the data streams <b>402</b> comprises, for example, an end to end connection carrying a voice call or a packet connection transmitting non-circuit switch packed data over a data connection. The multiple data streams <b>402</b> are processed by modulator/demodulator circuitry <b>404</b>. The modulator/demodulator circuitry <b>404</b> modulates the received data stream <b>402</b> onto a wavelength or frequency channel using a multiple level overlay modulation technique, as will be more fully described herein below. The communications link may comprise an optical fiber link, free-space optics link, RF microwave link, RF satellite link, wired link (without the twist), etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0099\">The modulated data stream is provided to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) signal processing block <b>406</b>. Each of the modulated data streams from the modulator/demodulator <b>404</b> are provided a different orbital angular momentum by the orbital angular momentum electromagnetic block <b>406</b> such that each of the modulated data streams have a unique and different orbital angular momentum associated therewith. Each of the modulated signals having an associated orbital angular momentum are provided to an optical transmitter <b>408</b> that transmits each of the modulated data streams having a unique orbital angular momentum on a same wavelength. Each wavelength has a selected number of bandwidth slots B and may have its data transmission capability increase by a factor of the number of degrees of orbital angular momentum <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> that are provided from the OAM electromagnetic block <b>406</b>. The optical transmitter <b>408</b> transmitting signals at a single wavelength could transmit B groups of information. The optical transmitter <b>408</b> and OAM electromagnetic block <b>406</b> may transmit <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>\u00d7B groups of information according to the configuration described herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0100\">In a receiving mode, the optical transmitter <b>408</b> will have a wavelength including multiple signals transmitted therein having different orbital angular momentum signals embedded therein. The optical transmitter <b>408</b> forwards these signals to the OAM signal processing block <b>406</b>, which separates each of the signals having different orbital angular momentum and provides the separated signals to the demodulator circuitry <b>404</b>. The demodulation process extracts the data streams <b>402</b> from the modulated signals and provides it at the receiving end using the multiple layer overlay demodulation technique.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0101\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, there is provided a more detailed functional description of the OAM signal processing block <b>406</b>. Each of the input data streams are provided to OAM circuitry <b>502</b>. Each of the OAM circuitry <b>502</b> provides a different orbital angular momentum to the received data stream. The different orbital angular momentums are achieved by applying different currents for the generation of the signals that are being transmitted to create a particular orbital angular momentum associated therewith. The orbital angular momentum provided by each of the OAM circuitries <b>502</b> are unique to the data stream that is provided thereto. An infinite number of orbital angular momentums may be applied to different input data streams using many different currents. Each of the separately generated data streams are provided to a signal combiner <b>504</b>, which combines the signals onto a wavelength for transmission from the transmitter <b>506</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0102\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated an embodiment in which the OAM processing circuitry <b>406</b> may separate a received signal into multiple data streams. The receiver <b>602</b> receives the combined OAM signals on a single wavelength and provides this information to a signal separator <b>604</b>. The signal separator <b>604</b> separates each of the signals having different orbital angular momentums from the received wavelength and provides the separated signals to OAM de-twisting circuitry <b>606</b>. The OAM de-twisting circuitry <b>606</b> removes the associated OAM twist from each of the associated signals and provides the received modulated data stream for further processing. The signal separator <b>604</b> separates each of the received signals that have had the orbital angular momentum removed therefrom into individual received signals. The individually received signals are provided to the receiver <b>602</b> for demodulation using, for example, multiple level overlay demodulation as will be more fully described herein below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0103\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates in a manner in which a single wavelength or frequency, having two quanti-spin polarizations may provide an infinite number of twists having various orbital angular momentums associated therewith. The 1 axis represents the various quantized orbital angular momentum states which may be applied to a particular signal at a selected frequency or wavelength. The symbol omega (\u03c9) represents the various frequencies to which the signals of differing orbital angular momentum may be applied. The top grid <b>702</b> represents the potentially available signals for a left handed signal polarization, while the bottom grid <b>704</b> is for potentially available signals having right handed polarization.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0104\">By applying different orbital angular momentum states to a signal at a particular frequency or wavelength, a potentially infinite number of states may be provided at the frequency or wavelength. Thus, the state at the frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength <b>706</b> in both the left handed polarization plane <b>702</b> and the right handed polarization plane <b>704</b> can provide an infinite number of signals at different orbital angular momentum states \u0394l. Blocks <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> represent a particular signal having an orbital angular momentum \u0394l at a frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength in both the right handed polarization plane <b>704</b> and left handed polarization plane <b>710</b>, respectively. By changing to a different orbital angular momentum within the same frequency \u0394\u03c9 or wavelength <b>706</b>, different signals may also be transmitted. Each angular momentum state corresponds to a different determined current level for transmission from the optical transmitter. By estimating the equivalent current for generating a particular orbital angular momentum within the optical domain and applying this current for transmission of the signals, the transmission of the signal may be achieved at a desired orbital angular momentum state.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0105\">Thus, the illustration of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>, illustrates two possible angular momentums, the spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum. The spin version is manifested within the polarizations of macroscopic electromagnetism, and has only left and right hand polarizations due to up and down spin directions. However, the orbital angular momentum indicates an infinite number of states that are quantized. The paths are more than two and can theoretically be infinite through the quantized orbital angular momentum levels.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0106\">It is well-known that the concept of linear momentum is usually associated with objects moving in a straight line. The object could also carry angular momentum if it has a rotational motion, such as spinning (i.e., spin angular momentum (SAM) <b>802</b>), or orbiting around an axis <b>806</b> (i.e., OAM <b>804</b>), as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, respectively. A light beam may also have rotational motion as it propagates. In paraxial approximation, a light beam carries SAM <b>802</b> if the electrical field rotates along the beam axis <b>806</b> (i.e., circularly polarized light <b>805</b>), and carries OAM <b>804</b> if the wave vector spirals around the beam axis <b>806</b>, leading to a helical phase front <b>808</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 8C and 8D</figref>. In its analytical expression, this helical phase front <b>808</b> is usually related to a phase term of exp(i<img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>\u03b8) in the transverse plane, where \u03b8 refers to the angular coordinate, and <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> is an integer indicating the number of intertwined helices (i.e., the number of 2\u03c0 phase shifts along the circle around the beam axis). <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> could be a positive, negative integer or zero, corresponding to clockwise, counterclockwise phase helices or a Gaussian beam with no helix, respectively.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0107\">Two important concepts relating to OAM include:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0108\">1) OAM and polarization: As mentioned above, an OAM beam is manifested as a beam with a helical phase front and therefore a twisting wavevector, while polarization states can only be connected to SAM <b>802</b>. A light beam carries SAM <b>802</b> of \u00b1h/2\u03c0 (h is Plank&#39;s constant) per photon if it is left or right circularly polarized, and carries no SAM <b>802</b> if it is linearly polarized. Although the SAM <b>802</b> and OAM <b>804</b> of light can be coupled to each other under certain scenarios, they can be clearly distinguished for a paraxial light beam. Therefore, with the paraxial assumption, OAM <b>804</b> and polarization can be considered as two independent properties of light.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0109\">2) OAM beam and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam: In general, an OAM-carrying beam could refer to any helically phased light beam, irrespective of its radial distribution (although sometimes OAM could also be carried by a non-helically phased beam). LG beam is a special subset among all OAM-carrying beams, due to that the analytical expression of LG beams are eigen-solutions of paraxial form of the wave equation in a cylindrical coordinates. For an LG beam, both azimuthal and radial wavefront distributions are well defined, and are indicated by two index numbers, <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> and p, of which <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> has the same meaning as that of a general OAM beam, and p refers to the radial nodes in the intensity distribution. Mathematical expressions of LG beams form an orthogonal and complete basis in the spatial domain. In contrast, a general OAM beam actually comprises a group of LG beams (each with the same <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00008\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> index but a different p index) due to the absence of radial definition. The term of \u201cOAM beam\u201d refers to all helically phased beams, and is used to distinguish from LG beams.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0110\">Using the orbital angular momentum state of the transmitted energy signals, physical information can be embedded within the radiation transmitted by the signals. The Maxwell-Heaviside equations can be represented as:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <maths id=\"MATH-US-00001\" num=\"00001\">\\n        <math overflow=\"scroll\">\\n

Using these equations, one can derive 23 symmetries/conserved quantities from Maxwell&#39;s original equations. However, there are only ten well-known conserved quantities and only a few of these are commercially used. Historically if Maxwell&#39;s equations where kept in their original quaternion forms, it would have been easier to see the symmetries/conserved quantities, but when they were modified to their present vectorial form by Heaviside, it became more difficult to see such inherent symmetries in Maxwell&#39;s equations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0111\">The conserved quantities and the electromagnetic field can be represented according to the conservation of system energy and the conservation of system linear momentum.

In the plane wave situation illustrated generally at <b>902</b>, the transmitted signal may take one of three configurations. When the electric field vectors are in the same direction, a linear signal is provided, as illustrated generally at <b>904</b>. Within a circular polarization <b>906</b>, the electric field vectors rotate with the same magnitude. Within the elliptical polarization <b>908</b>, the electric field vectors rotate but have differing magnitudes. The Poynting vector remains in a constant direction for the signal configuration to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9A</figref> and always perpendicular to the electric and magnetic fields. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9B</figref>, when a unique orbital angular momentum is applied to a signal as described here and above, the Poynting vector S <b>910</b> will spiral about the direction of propagation of the signal. This spiral may be varied in order to enable signals to be transmitted on the same frequency as described herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0119\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> illustrate the differences in signals having different helicity (i.e., orbital angular momentums). Each of the spiraling Poynting vectors associated with the signals <b>902</b>, <b>904</b>, and <b>906</b> provide a different shaped signal. Signal <b>1202</b> has an orbital angular momentum of +1, signal <b>1204</b> has an orbital angular momentum of +3, and signal <b>1206</b> has an orbital angular momentum of \u22124. Each signal has a distinct angular momentum and associated Poynting vector enabling the signal to be distinguished from other signals within a same frequency. This allows differing type of information to be combined on the same frequency, since these signals are separately detectable and do not interfere with each other (Eigen channels).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0120\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12D</figref> illustrates the propagation of Poynting vectors for various Eigen modes. Each of the rings <b>1220</b> represents a different Eigen mode or twist representing a different orbital angular momentum within the same frequency. Each of these rings <b>1220</b> represents a different orthogonal channel. Each of the Eigen modes has a Poynting vector <b>1222</b> associated therewith.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0121\">Topological charge may be multiplexed to the frequency for either linear or circular polarization. In case of linear polarizations, topological charge would be multiplexed on vertical and horizontal polarization. In case of circular polarization, topological charge would multiplex on left hand and right hand circular polarizations. The topological charge is another name for the helicity index \u201cI\u201d or the amount of twist or OAM applied to the signal. The helicity index may be positive or negative. In RF, different topological charges can be created and muxed together and de-muxed to separate the topological charges.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0122\">The topological charges <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00009\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> s can be created using Spiral Phase Plates (SPPs) as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9E</figref> using a proper material with specific index of refraction and ability to machine shop or phase mask, holograms created of new materials or a new technique to create an RF version of Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) that does the twist of the RF waves (as opposed to optical beams) by adjusting voltages on the device resulting in twisting of the RF waves with a specific topological charge.

However, cross talk and multipath interference can be corrected using RF Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO).

However, other techniques can be used to eliminate these channel impairments.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0124\">As described previously with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the multiple data streams applied within the processing circuitry has a multiple layer overlay modulation scheme applied thereto.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">Application of OAM to Optical Communication</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0125\">Utilization of OAM for optical communications is based on the fact that coaxially propagating light beams with different OAM states can be efficiently separated.

num=\"0126\">There are two different ways to take advantage of the distinction between OAM beams with different <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00015\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\"

In the first approach, N different OAM states can be encoded as N different data symbols representing \u201c0\u201d, \u201c1\u201d, . . . , \u201cN\u22121\u201d, respectively. A sequence of OAM states sent by the transmitter therefore represents data information. At the receiver, the data can be decoded by checking the received OAM state. This approach seems to be more favorable to the quantum communications community, since OAM could provide for the encoding of multiple bits (log 2(N)) per photon due to the infinitely countable possibilities of the OAM states, and so could potentially achieve a higher photon efficiency. The encoding/decoding of OAM states could also have some potential applications for on-chip interconnection to increase computing speed or data capacity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0127\">The second approach is to use each OAM beam as a different data carrier in an SDM (Spatial Division Multiplexing) system. For an SDM system, one could use either a multi-core fiber/free space laser beam array so that the data channels in each core/laser beam are spatially separated, or use a group of orthogonal mode sets to carry different data channels in a multi-mode fiber (MMF) or in free space. Greater than 1 petabit/s data transmission in a multi-core fiber and up to 6 linearly polarized (LP) modes each with two polarizations in a single core multi-mode fiber has been reported. Similar to the SDM using orthogonal modes, OAM beams with different states can be spatially multiplexed and demultiplexed, thereby providing independent data carriers in addition to wavelength and polarization. Ideally, the orthogonality of OAM beams can be maintained in transmission, which allows all the data channels to be separated and recovered at the receiver. A typical embodiments of OAM multiplexing is conceptually depicted in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>. An obvious benefit of OAM multiplexing is the improvement in system spectral efficiency, since the same bandwidth can be reused for additional data channels.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0006\">OAM Beam Generation and Detection</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0128\">Many approaches for creating OAM beams have been proposed and demonstrated. One could obtain a single or multiple OAM beams directly from the output of a laser cavity, or by converting a fundamental Gaussian beam into an OAM beam outside a cavity. The converter could be a spiral phase plate, diffractive phase holograms, metalmaterials, cylindrical lens pairs, q-plates or fiber structures. There are also different ways to detect an OAM beam, such as using a converter that creates a conjugate helical phase, or using a plasmonic detector.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0007\">Mode Conversion Approaches</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0129\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>, among all external-cavity methods, perhaps the most straightforward one is to pass a Gaussian beam through a coaxially placed spiral phase plate (SPP) <b>1202</b>. An SPP <b>1202</b> is an optical element with a helical surface, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>. To produce an OAM beam with a state of <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00016\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>, the thickness profile of the plate should be machined as <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00017\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>\u03bb\u03b8/2\u03c0(n\u22121), where n is the refractive index of the medium. A limitation of using an SPP <b>1202</b> is that each OAM state requires a different specific plate. As an alternative, reconfigurable diffractive optical elements, e.g., a pixelated spatial light modulator (SLM) <b>1204</b>, or a digital micro-mirror device can be programmed to function as any refractive element of choice at a given wavelength. As mentioned above, a helical phase profile exp(i<img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00018\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>\u03b8) converts a linearly polarized Gaussian laser beam into an OAM mode, whose wave front resembles an <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00019\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>-fold corkscrew <b>1206</b>, as shown at <b>1204</b>. Importantly, the generated OAM beam can be easily changed by simply updating the hologram loaded on the SLM <b>1204</b>. To spatially separate the phase-modulated beam from the zeroth-order non-phase-modulated reflection from the SLM, a linear phase ramp is added to helical phase code (i.e., a \u201cfork\u201d-like phase pattern <b>1208</b> to produce a spatially distinct first-order diffracted OAM beam, carrying the desired charge. It should also be noted that the aforementioned methods produce OAM beams with only an azimuthal index control. To generate a pure LG_(<img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00020\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>,p) mode, one must jointly control both the phase and the intensity of the wavefront. This could be achieved using a phase-only SLM with a more complex phase hologram.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0008\">OAM Beams Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0130\">One of the benefits of OAM is that multiple coaxially propagating OAM beams with different <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00021\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> states provide additional data carriers as they can be separated based only on the twisting wavefront. Hence, one of the critical techniques is the efficient multiplexing/demultiplexing of OAM beams of different <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00022\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> states, where each carries an independent data channel and all beams can be transmitted and received using a single aperture pair. Several multiplexing and demultiplexing techniques have been demonstrated, including the use of an inverse helical phase hologram to down-convert the OAM into a Gaussian beam, a mode sorter, free-space interferometers, a photonic integrated circuit, and q-plates. Some of these techniques are briefly described below.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0009\">Beam Splitter and Inverse Phase Hologram</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0131\">A straightforward way of multiplexing is simply to use cascaded 3-dB beam splitters (BS) <b>1302</b>. Each BS <b>1302</b> can coaxially multiplex two beams <b>1303</b> that are properly aligned, and cascaded N BSs can multiplex N+1 independent OAM beams at most, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>. Similarly, at the receiver end, the multiplexed beam <b>1305</b> is divided into four copies <b>1304</b> by BS <b>1302</b>. To demultiplex the data channel on one of the beams (e.g., with l=1_i), a phase hologram <b>1306</b> with a spiral charge of <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00023\" he=\"3.22mm\" wi=\"1.10mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00002.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>\u2212l<img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00024\" he=\"3.22mm\" wi=\"1.10mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00003.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>_i is applied to all the multiplexed beams <b>1304</b>. As a result, the helical phase on the target beam is removed, and this beam evolves into a fundamental Gaussian beam, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>. The down-converted beam can be isolated from the other beams, which still have helical phase fronts by using a spatial mode filter <b>1308</b> (e.g., a single mode fiber only couples the power of the fundamental Gaussian mode due to the mode matching theory). Accordingly, each of the multiplexed beams <b>1304</b> can be demultiplexed by changing the spiral phase hologram <b>1306</b>. Although this method is very power-inefficient since the BSs <b>1302</b> and the spatial mode filter <b>1306</b> cause a lot of power loss, it was used in the initial lab demonstrations of OAM multiplexing/demultiplexing, due to the simplicity of understanding and the reconfigurability provided by programmable SLMs.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0010\">Optical Geometrical Transformation-Based Mode Sorter</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0132\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, another method of multiplexing and demultiplexing, which could be more power-efficient than the previous one (using beam splitters), is the use of an OAM mode sorter.

Here, a and b are scaling constants. The corrector <b>1404</b> compensates for phase errors and ensures that the transformed beam is collimated. Considering an input OAM beam with a ring-shaped beam profile, it can be unfolded and mapped into a rectangular-shaped plane wave with a tilted phase front. Similarly, multiple OAM beams having different 1 states will be transformed into a series of plane waves each with a different phase tilt. A lens <b>1406</b> focuses these tilted plane waves into spatially separated spots in the focal plane such that all the OAM beams are simultaneously demultiplexed. As the transformation is reciprocal, if the mode sorter is used in reverse it can become a multiplexer for OAM. A Gaussian beam array placed in the focal plane of the lens <b>1406</b> is converted into superimposed plane waves with different tilts. These beams then pass through the corrector and the transformer sequentially to produce properly multiplexed OAM beams.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0011\">Free Space Communications</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0157\" num=\"0133\">The first proof-of-concept experiment using OAM for free space communications transmitted eight different OAM states each representing a data symbol one at a time. The azimuthal index of the transmitted OAM beam is measured at the receiver using a phase hologram modulated with a binary grating. To effectively use this approach, fast switching is required between different OAM states to achieve a high data rate. Alternatively, classic communications using OAM states as data carriers can be multiplexed at the transmitter, co-propagated through a free space link, and demultiplexed at a receiver. The total data rate of a free space communication link has reached 100 Tbit/s or even beyond by using OAM multiplexing.

increased to 100 Tbit/s by combining OAM multiplexing with PDM (phase division multiplexing) and WDM (wave division multiplexing). In this experiment, 24 OAM beams (<img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00027\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119, each with two polarizations) were prepared using 2 SLMs, the procedures for which are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref> at <b>1602</b>-<b>1606</b>. Specifically, one SLM generated a superposition of OAM beams with <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00028\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+4, +10, and +16, while the other SLM generated another set of three OAM beams with <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00029\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+7, +13, and +19 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref>). These two outputs were multiplexed together using a beam splitter, thereby multiplexing six OAM beams: <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00030\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+4, +7, +10, +13, +16, and +19 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref>). Secondly, the six multiplexed OAM beams were split into two copies. One copy was reflected five times by three mirrors and two beam splitters, to create another six OAM beams with inverse charges (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16B</figref>). There was a differential delay between the two light paths to de-correlate the data. These two copies were then combined again to achieve <b>12</b> multiplexed OAM beams with <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00031\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16B</figref>). These 12 OAM beams were split again via a beam splitter. One of these was polarization-rotated by 90 degrees, delayed by \u02dc33 symbols, and then recombined with the other copy using a polarization beam splitter (PBS), finally multiplexing 24 OAM beams (with <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00032\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=\u00b14, \u00b17, \u00b110, \u00b113, \u00b116, and \u00b119 on two polarizations).

It is known that inhomogeneities in the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere lead to random variations in the refractive index along the transmission path, and can easily distort the phase front of a light beam. This could be particularly important for OAM communications, since the separation of multiplexed OAM beams relies on the helical phase-front. As predicted by simulations in the literature, these refractive index inhomogeneities may cause inter-modal crosstalk among data channels with different OAM states.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0138\">The effect of atmospheric turbulence is also experimentally evaluated. For the convenience of estimating the turbulence strength, one approach is to emulate the turbulence in the lab using an SLM or a rotating phase plate. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17A</figref> illustrates an emulator built using a thin phase screen plate <b>1702</b> that is mounted on a rotation stage <b>1704</b> and placed in the middle of the optical path. The pseudo-random phase distribution machined on the plate <b>1702</b> obeys Kolmogorov spectrum statistics, which are usually characterized by a specific effective Fried coherence length r<b>0</b>. The strength of the simulated turbulence <b>1706</b> can be varied either by changing to a plate <b>1702</b> with a different r<b>0</b>, or by adjusting the size of the beam that is incident on the plate. The resultant turbulence effect is mainly evaluated by measuring the power of the distorted beam distributed to each OAM mode using an OAM mode sorter. It was found that, as the turbulence strength increases, the power of the transmitted OAM mode would leak to neighboring modes and tend to be equally distributed among modes for stronger turbulence. As an example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the measured average power (normalized) l=3 beam under different emulated turbulence conditions. It can be seen that the majority of the power is still in the transmitted OAM mode <b>1708</b> under weak turbulence, but it spreads to neighboring modes as the turbulence strength increases.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0014\">Turbulence Effects Mitigation Techniques</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0139\">One approach to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence on OAM beams is to use an adaptive optical (AO) system. The general idea of an AO system is to measure the phase front of the distorted beam first, based on which an error correction pattern can be produced and can be applied onto the beam transmitter to undo the distortion. As for OAM beams with helical phase fronts, it is challenging to directly measure the phase front using typical wavefront sensors due to the phase singularity. A modified AO system can overcome this problem by sending a Gaussian beam as a probe beam to sense the distortion, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref>. Due to the fact that turbulence is almost independent of the light polarization, the probe beam is orthogonally polarized as compared to all other beams for the sake of convenient separation at beam separator <b>1802</b>. The correction phase pattern can be derived based on the probe beam distortion that is directly measured by a wavefront sensor <b>1704</b>. It is noted that this phase correction pattern can be used to simultaneously compensate multiple coaxially propagating OAM beams. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref> at <b>1810</b>-<b>1820</b> illustrate the intensity profiles of OAM beams with l=1, 5 and 9, respectively, for a random turbulence realization with and without mitigation. From the far-field images, one can see that the distorted OAM beams (upper), up to l=9, were partially corrected, and the measured power distribution also indicates that the channel crosstalk can be reduced.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0140\">Another approach for combating turbulence effects is to partially move the complexity of optical setup into the electrical domain, and use digital signal processing (DSP) to mitigate the channel crosstalk. A typical DSP method is the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) equalization, which is able to blindly estimate the channel crosstalk and cancel the interference. The implementation of a 4\u00d74 adaptive MIMO equalizer in a four-channel OAM multiplexed free space optical link using heterodyne detection may be used. Four OAM beams (l=+2, +4, +6 and +8), each carrying 20 Gbit/s QPSK data, were collinearly multiplexed and propagated through a weak turbulence emulated by the rotating phase plate under laboratory condition to introduce distortions. After demultiplexing, four channels were coherently detected and recorded simultaneously. The standard constant modulus algorithm is employed in addition to the standard procedures of coherent detection to equalize the channel interference. Results indicate that MIMO equalization could be helpful to mitigate the crosstalk caused by either turbulence or imperfect mode generation/detection, and improve both error vector magnitude (EVM) and the bit-error-rate (BER) of the signal in an OAM-multiplexed communication link. MIMO DSP may not be universally useful as outage could happen in some scenarios involving free space data links. For example, the majority power of the transmitted OAM beams may be transferred to other OAM states under a strong turbulence without being detected, in which case MIMO would not help to improve the system performance.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0015\">OAM Free Space Link Design Considerations</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0141\">To date, most of the experimental demonstrations of optical communication links using OAM beams took place in the lab conditions. There is a possibility that OAM beams may also be used in a free space optical communication link with longer distances. To design such a data link using OAM multiplexing, several important issues such as beam divergence, aperture size and misalignment of two transmitter and receiver, need to be resolved. To study how those parameters affect the performance of an OAM multiplexed system, a simulation model was described by Xie et al, the schematic setup of which is shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>. Each of the different collimated Gaussian beams <b>1902</b> at the same wavelength is followed by a spiral phase plate <b>1904</b> with a unique order to convert the Gaussian beam into a data-carrying OAM beam. Different orders of OAM beams are then multiplexed at multiplexor <b>1906</b> to form a concentric-ring-shape and coaxially propagate from transmitter <b>1908</b> through free space to the receiver aperture located at a certain propagation distance. Propagation of multiplexed OAM beams is numerically propagated using the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integral. To investigate the signal power and crosstalk effect on neighboring OAM channels, power distribution among different OAM modes is analyzed through a modal decomposition approach, which corresponds to the case where the received OAM beams are demultiplexed without power loss and the power of a desired OAM channel is completely collected by its receiver <b>1910</b>.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0016\">Beam Divergence</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0142\">For a communication link, it is generally preferable to collect as much signal power as possible at the receiver to ensure a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Based on the diffraction theory, it is known that a collimated OAM beam diverges while propagating in free space. Given the same spot size of three cm at the transmitter, an OAM beam with a higher azimuthal index diverges even faster, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20A</figref>. On the other hand, the receiving optical element usually has a limited aperture size and may not be able to collect all of the beam power. The calculated link power loss as a function of receiver aperture size is shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 35B</figref>, with different transmission distances and various transmitted beam sizes. Unsurprisingly, the power loss of a 1-km link is higher than that of a 100-m link under the same transmitted beam size due to larger beam divergence. It is interesting to note that a system with a transmitted beam size of 3 cm suffers less power loss than that of 1 cm and 10 cm over a 100-m link. The 1-cm transmitted beam diverges faster than the 3 cm beam due to its larger diffraction. However, when the transmitted beam size is 10 cm, the geometrical characteristics of the beam dominate over the diffraction, thus leading larger spot size at the receiver than the 3 cm transmitted beam. A trade-off between the diffraction, geometrical characteristics and the number of OAMs of the beam therefore needs to be carefully considered in order to achieve a proper-size received beam when designing a link.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0017\">Misalignment Tolerance</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0143\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21A-21C</figref>, besides the power loss due to limited-size aperture and beam divergence, another issue that needs further discussion is the potential misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver. In an ideal OAM multiplexed communication link, transmitter and receiver would be perfectly aligned, (i.e., the center of the receiver would overlap with the center of the transmitted beam <b>2102</b>, and the receiver plane <b>2104</b> would be perpendicular to the line connecting their centers, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21A</figref>). However, due to difficulties in aligning because of substrate distances, and jitter and vibration of the transmitter/receiver platform, the transmitter and receiver may have relative lateral shift (i.e., lateral displacement) (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21B</figref>) or angular shift (i.e., receiver angular error) (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21C</figref>). Both types of misalignment may lead to degradation of system performance.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0144\">Focusing on a link distance of 100 m, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref> show the power distribution among different OAM modes due to lateral displacement and receiver angular error when only <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00034\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+3 is transmitted with a transmitted beam size of 3 cm. In order to investigate the effect of misalignment, the receiver aperture size is chosen to be 10 cm, which could cover the whole OAM beam at the receiver. As the lateral displacement or receiver angular error increases, power leakage to other modes (i.e., channel crosstalk) increases while the power on <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00035\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+3 state decreases. This is because larger lateral displacement or receiver angular causes larger phase profile mismatch between the received OAM beams and receiver. The power leakage to <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00036\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+1 and <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00037\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+5 is greater than that of <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00038\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+2 and <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00039\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+3 due to their larger mode spacing with respect to <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00040\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/>=+3. Therefore, a system with larger mode spacing (which also uses higher order OAM states suffers less crosstalk. However, such a system may also have a larger power loss due to the fast divergence of higher order OAM beams, as discussed above. Clearly, this trade-off between channel crosstalk and power loss shall be considered when choosing the mode spacing in a specific OAM multiplexed link.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0145\">An additional configuration in which the optical angular momentum processing and multi-layer overlay modulation technique described herein above may prove useful within the optical network framework is use with free-space optics communications. Free-space optics systems provide a number of advantages over traditional RF based systems from improved isolation between the systems, the size and the cost of the receivers/transmitters, need for an FCC license, and by combining space, lighting, and communication into the same system. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 23</figref>, there is illustrated an example of the operation of a free-space communication system. The free-space communication system utilizes a free-space optics transmitter <b>2302</b> that transmits a light beam <b>2304</b> to a free-space optics receiver <b>2306</b>. The major difference between a fiber-optic network and a free-space optic network is that the information beam is transmitted through free space rather than over a fiber-optic cable. This causes a number of link difficulties, which will be more fully discussed herein below. However, because the free space system does not have the optic fiber to act as a waveguide, it is more susceptible to the problems outlined above. Free-space optics is a line of sight technology that uses the invisible beams of light to provide optical bandwidth connections that can send and receive up to 2.5 Gbps of data, voice, and video communications between a transmitter <b>2302</b> and a receiver <b>2306</b>. Free-space optics uses the same concepts as fiber-optics, except without the use of a fiber-optic cable. Free-space optics systems provide the light beam <b>2304</b> within the infrared (IR) spectrum, which is at the low end of the light spectrum. Specifically, the optical signal is in the range of 300 Gigahertz to 1 Terahertz in terms of wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0146\">Presently existing free-space optics systems can provide data rates of up to 10 Gigabits per second at a distance of up to 2.5 kilometers. In outer space, the communications range of free space optical communications is currently on the order of several thousand kilometers, but has the potential to bridge interplanetary distances of millions of kilometers, using optical telescopes as beam expanders. In January of 2013, NASA used lasers to beam an image of the Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter roughly 240,000 miles away. To compensate for atmospheric interference, an error correction code algorithm, similar to that used within compact discs, was implemented.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0147\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of a free-space optics system using orbital angular momentum and multilevel overlay modulation according to the present disclosure. The OAM twisted signals, in addition to being transmitted over fiber, may also be transmitted using free optics. In this case, the transmission signals are generated within transmission circuitry <b>2402</b> at each of the FSO transceivers <b>2404</b>. Free-space optics technology is based on the connectivity between the FSO based optical wireless units, each consisting of an optical transceiver <b>2404</b> with a transmitter <b>2402</b> and a receiver <b>2406</b> to provide full duplex open pair and bidirectional closed pairing capability. Each optical wireless transceiver unit <b>2404</b> additionally includes an optical source <b>2408</b> plus a lens or telescope <b>2410</b> for transmitting light through the atmosphere to another lens <b>2410</b> receiving the information. At this point, the receiving lens or telescope <b>2410</b> connects to a high sensitivity receiver <b>2406</b> via optical fiber <b>2412</b>. The transmitting transceiver <b>2404</b> <i>a </i>and the receiving transceiver <b>2404</b> <i>b </i>have to have line of sight to each other and be aligned both laterally and angularly. Obstacles, such as, trees, buildings, animals, and atmospheric conditions, all can hinder the line of sight needed for this communications medium. Since line of sight is so critical, some systems make use of beam divergence or a diffused beam approach, which involves a large field of view that tolerates substantial line of sight interference without significant impact on overall signal quality. The system may also be equipped with auto tracking mechanism <b>2414</b> that maintains a tightly focused beam on the receiving transceiver <b>1904</b> <i>b</i>, even when the transceivers are mounted on tall buildings or other structures that sway.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0148\">The modulated light source used with optical source <b>2408</b> is typically a laser or light emitting diode (LED) providing the transmitted optical signal that determines all the transmitter capabilities of the system. Only the detector sensitivity within the receiver <b>2406</b> plays an equally important role in total system performance. For telecommunications purposes, only lasers that are capable of being modulated at 20 Megabits per second to 2.5 Gigabits per second can meet current marketplace demands. Additionally, how the device is modulated and how much modulated power is produced are both important to the selection of the device. Lasers in the 780-850 nm and 1520-1600 nm spectral bands meet frequency requirements.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0149\">Commercially available FSO systems operate in the near IR wavelength range between 750 and 1600 nm, with one or two systems being developed to operate at the IR wavelength of 10,000 nm. The physics and transmissions properties of optical energy as it travels through the atmosphere are similar throughout the visible and near IR wavelength range, but several factors that influence which wavelengths are chosen for a particular system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0150\">The atmosphere is considered to be highly transparent in the visible and near IR wavelength. However, certain wavelengths or wavelength bands can experience severe absorption. In the near IR wavelength, absorption occurs primarily in response to water particles (i.e., moisture) which are an inherent part of the atmosphere, even under clear weather conditions. There are several transmission windows that are nearly transparent (i.e., have an attenuation of less than 0.2 dB per kilometer) within the 700-10,000 nm wavelength range. These wavelengths are located around specific center wavelengths, with the majority of free-space optics systems designed to operate in the windows of 780-850 nm and 1520-1600 nm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0151\">Wavelengths in the 780-850 nm range are suitable for free-space optics operation and higher power laser sources may operate in this range. At 780 nm, inexpensive CD lasers may be used, but the average lifespan of these lasers can be an issue. These issues may be addressed by running the lasers at a fraction of their maximum rated output power which will greatly increase their lifespan. At around 850 nm, the optical source <b>2408</b> may comprise an inexpensive, high performance transmitter and detector components that are readily available and commonly used in network transmission equipment. Highly sensitive silicon (SI) avalanche photodiodes (APD) detector technology and advanced vertical cavity emitting laser may be utilized within the optical source <b>2408</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0152\">VCSEL technology may be used for operation in the 780 to 850 nm range. Possible disadvantage of this technology include beam detection through the use of a night vision scope, although it is still not possible to demodulate a perceived light beam using this technique.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0153\">Wavelengths in the 1520-1600 nm range are well-suited for free-space transmission, and high quality transmitter and detector components are readily available for use within the optical source block <b>2408</b>. The combination of low attenuation and high component availability within this wavelength range makes the development of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) free-space optics systems feasible. However, components are generally more expensive and detectors are typically less sensitive and have a smaller receive surface area when compared with silicon avalanche photodiode detectors that operator at the 850 nm wavelength. These wavelengths are compatible with erbium-doped fiber amplifier technology, which is important for high power (greater than 500 milliwatt) and high data rate (greater than 2.5 Gigabytes per second) systems. Fifty to 65 times as much power can be transmitted at the 1520-1600 nm wavelength than can be transmitted at the 780-850 nm wavelength for the same eye safety classification. Disadvantages of these wavelengths include the inability to detect a beam with a night vision scope. The night vision scope is one technique that may be used for aligning the beam through the alignment circuitry <b>2414</b>. Class 1 lasers are safe under reasonably foreseeable operating conditions including the use of optical instruments for intrabeam viewing. Class 1 systems can be installed at any location without restriction.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0154\">Another potential optical source <b>2408</b> comprised Class 1M lasers. Class 1M laser systems operate in the wavelength range from 302.5 to 4000 nm, which is safe under reasonably foreseeable conditions, but may be hazardous if the user employs optical instruments within some portion of the beam path. As a result, Class 1M systems should only be installed in locations where the unsafe use of optical aids can be prevented. Examples of various characteristics of both Class 1 and Class 1M lasers that may be used for the optical source <b>2408</b> are illustrated in Table 2 below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\"

commercial free space optic arena and is being developed because of better fog transmission capabilities. There is presently considerable debate regarding these characteristics because they are heavily dependent upon fog type and duration. Few components are available at the 10,000 nm wavelength, as it is normally not used within telecommunications equipment. Additionally, 10,000 nm energy does not penetrate glass, so it is ill-suited to behind window deployment.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0156\">Within these wavelength windows, FSO systems should have the following characteristics. The system should have the ability to operate at higher power levels, which is important for longer distance FSO system transmissions. The system should have the ability to provide high speed modulation, which is important for high speed FSO systems. The system should provide a small footprint and low power consumption, which is important for overall system design and maintenance. The system should have the ability to operate over a wide temperature range without major performance degradations such that the systems may prove useful for outdoor systems. Additionally, the mean time between failures should exceed 10 years. Presently existing FSO systems generally use VCSELS for operation in the shorter IR wavelength range, and Fabry-P\u00e9rot or distributed feedback lasers for operation in the longer IR wavelength range. Several other laser types are suitable for high performance FSO systems.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0157\">A free-space optics system using orbital angular momentum processing and multi-layer overlay modulation would provide a number of advantages. The system would be very convenient. Free-space optics provides a wireless solution to a last-mile connection, or a connection between two buildings. There is no necessity to dig or bury fiber cable. Free-space optics also requires no RF license. The system is upgradable and its open interfaces support equipment from a variety of vendors. The system can be deployed behind windows, eliminating the need for costly rooftop sites. Further, it is easier to deploy in buildings as the system can be located as the area requires, saving significant costs of running cables to rooftops. It is also immune to radiofrequency interference or saturation. The system is also fairly speedy. The system provides 10 Gigabits per second of data throughput. This provides ample bandwidth to transfer files between two sites. With the growth in the size of files, free-space optics provides the necessary bandwidth to transfer these files efficiently.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0158\">Free-space optics also provides a secure wireless solution. The laser beam cannot be detected with a spectral analyzer or RF meter. The beam is invisible, which makes it difficult to find. The laser beam that is used to transmit and receive the data is very narrow. This means that it is almost impossible to intercept the data being transmitted. One would have to be within the line of sight between the receiver and the transmitter in order to be able to accomplish this feat. If this occurs, this would alert the receiving site that a connection has been lost or the amount of signal received severely diminished. Thus, minimal security upgrades would be required for a free-space optics system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0159\">However, there are several weaknesses with free-space optics systems. The distance of a free-space optics system is very limited. Currently operating distances are approximately within 2 kilometers. Although this is a powerful system with great throughput, the limitation of distance is a big deterrent for full-scale implementation. Further, the more OAMs applied, the greater divergence over distance. Additionally, all systems require line of sight be maintained at all times during transmission. Any obstacle, be it environmental or animals can hinder the transmission. Free-space optic technology must be designed to combat changes in the atmosphere which can affect free-space optic system performance capacity. Finally, any shift in the mounting apparatus can cause the beam to be misaligned. Shifts can be caused by wind, earthquakes, ground shifting and even traffic.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0160\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25A through 25D</figref>, in order to achieve higher data capacity within optical links, an additional degree of freedom from multiplexing multiple data channels must be exploited. Moreover, the ability to use two different orthogonal multiplexing techniques together has the potential to dramatically enhance system performance and increased bandwidth.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0161\">One multiplexing technique which may exploit the possibilities is mode division multiplexing (MDM) using orbital angular momentum (OAM). OAM mode refers to laser beams within a free-space optical system or fiber-optic system that have a phase term of e<sup>il\u03c6 </sup>in their wave fronts, in which \u03c6 is the azimuth angle and <img id=\"CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00041\" he=\"2.79mm\" wi=\"1.44mm\" file=\"US20190025760A1-20190124-P00001.TIF\" alt=\"custom-character\" img-content=\"character\" img-format=\"tif\" orientation=\"portrait\" inline=\"no\"/> determines the OAM value (topological charge). In general, OAM modes have a \u201cdonut-like\u201d ring shaped intensity distribution. Multiple spatial collocated laser beams, which carry different OAM values, are orthogonal to each other and can be used to transmit multiple independent data channels on the same wavelength. Consequently, the system capacity and spectral efficiency in terms of bits/S/Hz can be dramatically increased. Free-space communications links using OAM may support 100 Tbits/capacity. Various techniques for implementing this as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 25A through 25D</figref> include a combination of multiple beams <b>2502</b> having multiple different OAM values <b>2504</b> on each wavelength. Thus, beam <b>2502</b> includes OAM values, OAM<b>1</b> and OAM<b>4</b>. Beam <b>2506</b> includes OAM value 2 and OAM value 5. Finally, beam <b>2508</b> includes OAM<b>3</b> value and OAM<b>6</b> value. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25B</figref>, there is illustrated a single beam wavelength <b>2510</b> using a first group of OAM values <b>2512</b> having both a positive OAM value <b>2512</b> and a negative OAM value <b>2514</b>. Similarly, OAM<b>2</b> value may have a positive value <b>2516</b> and a negative value <b>2518</b> on the same wavelength <b>2510</b>. While mode division multiplexing of OAM modes is described above, other orthogonal functions may be used with mode division multiplexing such as Laguerre Gaussian functions, Hermite Gaussian functions, Jacobi functions, Gegenbauer functions, Legendre functions and Chebyshev functions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0162\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25C</figref> illustrates the use of a wavelength <b>2520</b> having polarization multiplexing of OAM value. The wavelength <b>2520</b> can have multiple OAM values <b>2522</b> multiplexed thereon. The number of available channels can be further increased by applying left or right handed polarization to the OAM values. Finally, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25D</figref> illustrates two groups of concentric rings <b>2560</b>, <b>2562</b> for a wavelength having multiple OAM values.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0163\">Another multiplexing technique is wavelength distribution multiplexing (WDM), WDM has been widely used to improve the optical communication capacity within both fiber-optic systems and free-space communication system. Combining OAM and WDM has not previously been done. However, OAM mode multiplexing and WDM are mutually orthogonal such that they can be combined to achieve a dramatic increase in system capacity. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26</figref>, there is illustrated a scenario where each WDM channel <b>2602</b> contains many orthogonal OAM beam <b>2604</b>. Thus, using a combination of orbital angular momentum with wave division multiplexing, a significant enhancement in communication link to capacity may be achieved.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0164\">Current optical communication architectures have considerable routing challenges. A routing protocol for use with free-space optic system must take into account the line of sight requirements for optical communications within a free-space optics system. However, an optics network may be modeled as a directed hierarchical random sector geometric graph in which sensors route their data via multi-hop paths to a base station through a cluster head. This technique is a new efficient routing algorithm for local neighborhood discovery and a base station uplink and downlink discovery algorithm. The routing protocol requires order O log(n) storage at each node versus order O(n) used within current techniques and architectures. This new technique has the advantage of being much faster than current systems.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0165\">Current routing protocols are based on link state, distance vectors, path vectors, or source routing, and they differ from the new routing technique in significant manners. First, current techniques assume that a fraction of the links are bidirectional. This is not true within a free-space optic network in which links are unidirectional. Second, many current protocols are designed for ad hoc networks in which the routing protocol is designed to support multi-hop communications between any pair of nodes. The goal of the sensor network is to route sensor readings to the base station. Therefore, the dominant traffic patterns are different from those in an ad hoc network. In a sensor network, node to base stations, base station to nodes, and local neighborhood communication are mostly used.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0166\">Many paths of wireless and free space network are unidirectional. Recent studies on wireless and free space optical systems show that as many as 5 percent to 10 percent of links and wireless ad hoc networks are unidirectional due to various factors. Routing protocols such as DSDV and AODV use a reverse path technique, implicitly ignoring such unidirectional links and are therefore not relevant in this scenario. Other protocols such as DSR, ZRP, or ZRL have been designed or modified to accommodate unidirectionality by detecting unidirectional links and then providing bidirectional abstraction for such links. Unidirectionality only allows information transmission in a single direction which does not enable a response to be provided to an information transmission system. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27</figref>, one solution for dealing with unidirectionality is tunneling, in which bidirectionality is emulated for a unidirectional link by using bidirectional links on a reverse back channel to establish the tunnel. Tunneling also prevents implosion of acknowledgement packets and looping by simply pressing link layer acknowledgements for tunneled packets received on a unidirectional link. Tunneling, however, works well in mostly bidirectional networks with few unidirectional links.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0167\">Within a network using only unidirectional links such as a free-space optical network, systems such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> would be more applicable. Nodes within a unidirectional network utilize a directional transmit <b>2702</b> transmitting from the node <b>2700</b> in a single, defined direction. Additionally, each node <b>2700</b> includes an omnidirectional receiver <b>2704</b> which can receive a signal coming to the node in any direction. Also, as discussed here and above, the node <b>2700</b> would also include a O log(n) storage <b>2706</b>. Thus, each node <b>2700</b> provide only unidirectional communications links. Thus, a series of nodes <b>2700</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 28</figref> may unidirectionally communicate with any other node <b>2700</b> and forward communication from one location to another through a sequence of interconnected nodes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0168\">Multiplexing of the topological charge to the RF as well as free space optics in real time provides redundancy and better capacity. When channel impairments from atmospheric disturbances or scintillation impact the information signals, it is possible to toggle between free space optics to RF and back in real time. This approach still uses twisted waves on both the free space optics as well as the RF signal.

The dual RF and free space optics mechanism <b>2902</b> include a free space optics projection portion <b>2904</b> that transmits a light wave having an orbital angular momentum applied thereto with multilevel overlay modulation and a RF portion <b>2906</b> including circuitry necessary for transmitting information with orbital angular momentum and multilayer overlay on an RF signal <b>2910</b>. The dual RF and free space optics mechanism <b>2902</b> may be multiplexed in real time between the free space optics signal <b>2908</b> and the RF signal <b>2910</b> depending upon operating conditions. In some situations, the free space optics signal <b>2908</b> would be most appropriate for transmitting the data.

The laser beam generator <b>3004</b> generates a beam <b>3006</b> including plane waves that is provided to a MicroElectroMechanical system (MEMs) device <b>3008</b>. Examples of MEMs devices <b>3008</b> include digital light processing (DLP) projectors or digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs) that enable the generation of light beams having various characteristics. A MEMs device <b>3008</b> can generate Hermite Gaussian (HG) modes, Laguerre Gaussian (LG) modes and vortex OAM modes that are programmed responsive to inputs to the MEMs device <b>3008</b>. The MEMs device <b>3008</b> has mode selection logic <b>3010</b> that enable selection of the Laguerre Gaussian, Hermite Gaussian and vortex OAM modes (or other orthogonal function modes) for processing of the incoming light beam <b>3006</b>. The MEMs device <b>3008</b> further enables switching between the different modes at a very high rate of a few thousand times per second which is not achievable using spatial light modulator (SLMs). Switching between the modes is controlled via mode switching logic <b>3012</b>. This fast switching enables these forms of OAM, HG or LG mode generation for communications as well as quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum computers for quantum information processing. The orthogonal characteristics of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) with OAM and Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams combined with high-speed switching of MEMs make the device useful in achieving higher data capacity. This is possible using holograms that are programmed into the memory of a DLP that program micro-mirrors to selected positions and can twist a light beam with programmed information using the mirrors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0177\">This enables the on-demand realization of binary gratings (holograms) that can be switched between at very high speed using an external digital signal. Using, for example, DLP technologies, a switch between different modes (different binary gratings) may be achieved at a very high rate of speed of a few thousand times per second which is not achievable using spatial light modulators (SLMs). This allows for the dynamic control of helicities provided to a beam of light for a new modulation and/or multiple access technique to encode information.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0178\">DLP&#39;s allow for high resolution and accuracy from micrometers to millimeters thus enabling a variety of frequencies from infrared to ultraviolet to be utilized. The use of DLP&#39;s for MDM (mode division multiplexing) minimizes color, distance, movement and environmental sensitivity and is thus ideal for building integrated optics. The majority of SLM&#39;s are limited by a frame refresh rate of about 60 Hz which makes the high speed, wide range of operational spectral bandwidth of digital micro-mirror devices (DMD&#39;s) useful in a variety of applications. DMD designs inherently minimize temperature sensitivity for reliable 3-D wave construction.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0179\">The vast majority of commercially available SLM devices are limited to frame rate of about 60 Hz which considerably limits the speed of operation of any system based on this technology. A DMD is an amplitude only spatial light modulator. The high speed, wide range of operational spectral bandwidth and high power threshold of a DMDs makes the device a useful tool for variety of applications. Variations of DMD&#39;s are commercially available for a fraction of the cost of a phase only SLM. Intensity shaping of spatial modes can be achieved by switching the micro mirrors on and off rapidly. However, the modes created during this process may not be temporally stable and have the desired intensity profile only when averaged by a slow detector.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0180\">Phase and amplitude information may be encoded by modulating the position and width of a binary amplitude grating implemented within a hologram such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 31A-31H</figref>. By implementing such holograms to control a DMD, HG modes, LG modes, OAM vortex modes or any angular (ANG) mode may be created by properly programming the DMD with a hologram. Additionally, the switching between the generated modes may be performed at a very high speed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0207\" num=\"0181\">This approach may be realized by considering a one-dimensional binary amplitude grating. The transmission function for this grating can be written as:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <maths id=\"MATH-US-00013\" num=\"00013\">\\n        <math overflow=\"scroll\">\\n          <mrow>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <mi>\u03c4</mi>\\n              <mo>\\ue8a0</mo>\\n              <mrow>\\n                <mo>(</mo>\\n                <mi>x</mi>\\n                <mo>)</mo>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </mrow>\\n            <mo>=</mo>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <munderover>\\n                <mo>\u2211</mo>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mi>n</mi>\\n                  <mo>=</mo>\\n                  <mrow>\\n                    <mo>-</mo>\\n                    <mi>\u221e</mi>\\n                  </mrow>\\n                </mrow>\\n                <mi>\u221e</mi>\\n              </munderover>\\n              <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n              <mstyle>\\n                <mspace width=\"0.3em\" height=\"0.3ex\"> </mspace>\\n              </mstyle>\\n              <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n              <mrow>\\n                <mo>\u220f</mo>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mo>[</mo>\\n                  <mfrac>\\n                    <mrow>\\n                      <mi>x</mi>\\n                      <mo>-</mo>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mo>(</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mi>n</mi>\\n                            <mo>+</mo>\\n                            <mi>k</mi>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                          <mo>)</mo>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                        <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                        <msub>\\n                          <mi>x</mi>\\n                          <mn>0</mn>\\n                        </msub>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                    </mrow>\\n                    <msub>\\n                      <mi>wx</mi>\\n                      <mn>0</mn>\\n                    </msub>\\n                  </mfrac>\\n                  <mo>]</mo>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </mrow>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </math>\\n      </maths>\\n    </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0209\" num=\"0000\">where</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0210\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <maths id=\"MATH-US-00014\" num=\"00014\">\\n        <math overflow=\"scroll\">\\n          <mrow>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <mo>\u220f</mo>\\n              <mrow>\\n                <mo>(</mo>\\n                <mi>v</mi>\\n                <mo>)</mo>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </mrow>\\n            <mo>=</mo>\\n            <mrow>\\n              <mrow>\\n                <mi>Rect</mi>\\n                <mo>\\ue8a0</mo>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mo>(</mo>\\n                  <mi>v</mi>\\n                  <mo>)</mo>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mrow>\\n              <mo>=</mo>\\n              <mrow>\\n                <mo>{</mo>\\n                <mtable>\\n                  <mtr>\\n                    <mtd>\\n                      <mn>1</mn>\\n                    </mtd>\\n                    <mtd>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mi>if</mi>\\n                          <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                          <mstyle>\\n                            <mspace width=\"0.8em\" height=\"0.8ex\"> </mspace>\\n                          </mstyle>\\n                          <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mo>\\uf603</mo>\\n                            <mi>v</mi>\\n                            <mo>\\uf604</mo>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                        <mo>\u2264</mo>\\n                        <mn>1</mn>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                    </mtd>\\n                  </mtr>\\n                  <mtr>\\n                    <mtd>\\n                      <mn>0</mn>\\n                    </mtd>\\n                    <mtd>\\n                      <mi>else</mi>\\n                    </mtd>\\n                  </mtr>\\n                </mtable>\\n                <mo>}</mo>\\n              </mrow>\\n            </mrow>\\n          </mrow>\\n        </math>\\n      </maths>\\n    </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0211\" num=\"0182\">This function can be pictured as a pulse train with a period of x<sub>0</sub>.

Therefore, the phase and the amplitude of the diffracted light can be controlled by setting the parameters k(x) and w(x). In communication theory, these methods are sometimes referred to as pulse position modulation (PPM) and pulse width modulation (PWM). The equation above is a good approximation for slowly varying k(x) and w(x) functions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0215\" num=\"0185\">The above analysis treats a one-dimensional case.

The device consist of an array of micro mirrors that can be controlled in a binary fashion by setting the deflection angle of an individual mirror to either +12\u00b0 or \u221212\u00b0. Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32A</figref>, there is illustrated a general block diagram of a DMD <b>3202</b>. The DMD <b>3202</b> includes a plurality of micro-mirrors <b>3208</b> arranged in an X by Y array. The array may comprise a 1024\u00d7768 array of aluminum micro-mirrors such as that implemented in the DLP <b>5500</b> DMD Array. However, it will be appreciated that other array sizes and DMD devices may be used. Each micro-mirror <b>3208</b> includes a combination of opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical elements. Each micro-mirror <b>3208</b> comprises a pixel of the DMD <b>3202</b>. The micro-mirror <b>3208</b> is an electromechanical element having two stable micro-mirror states of +12\u00b0 and \u221212\u00b0. The micro-mirrors have a 10.8 micrometer pitch and are designed for light having a wavelength of 420 nm-700 nm. The state of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b> is determined by the geometry and electrostatics of the pixel during operation. The two positions of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b> determine the direction that the light beam striking the mirror is deflected. In particular, the DMD <b>3202</b> is a spatial light modulator. By convention, the positive (+) state is tilted toward the illumination and is referred to as the \u201con\u201d state. Similarly, the negative (\u2212) state is tilted away from the illumination and is referred to as the \u201coff\u201d state.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0223\" num=\"0189\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32B</figref> illustrates the manner in which a micro-mirror <b>3208</b> will interact with a light source <b>3230</b> such as a laser. The light source <b>3230</b> shines a beam along angle of \u221224\u00b0 that strikes the micro-mirror <b>3208</b>. When the mirror is in the \u201coff\u201d state <b>3232</b> at an angle of \u221212\u00b0, the off state energy <b>3234</b> is reflected at an angle of 48\u00b0. When the mirror <b>3208</b> is positioned at the flat state <b>3236</b> of 0\u00b0, the flat state energy <b>3238</b> is reflected in an angle of 24\u00b0. Finally, when the mirror is at +12\u00b0 in the \u201con\u201d state <b>3240</b>, the on state energy <b>3242</b> is reflected at 0\u00b0 through the projection lens <b>3244</b> of a DMD.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0224\" num=\"0190\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 33</figref>, there is illustrated a view of the mechanical structure of a micro-mirror <b>3208</b>. The micro-mirror <b>3208</b> includes the mirror <b>3302</b> attached to a torsional hinge <b>3304</b> along a diagonal axis <b>3306</b> of the mirror. The underside of the micro-mirror <b>3302</b> makes electrical contact with the remainder of the circuitry via spring tips <b>3308</b>. A pair of electrodes <b>3310</b> is used for holding the micro-mirror <b>3302</b> in one of the two operational positions (+12\u00b0 and \u221212\u00b0).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0225\" num=\"0191\">Referring now also to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 34</figref>, there is illustrated a block diagram of the functional components of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b>. Below each micro-mirror <b>3208</b> is a memory cell <b>3402</b> consisting of dual CMOS memory elements <b>3404</b>. The states of the two memory elements <b>3404</b> are not independent, but are always complementary. If one CMOS memory element <b>3404</b> is at a logical \u201c1\u201d level, the other CMOS element is at a logical \u201c0\u201d and vice versa. The state of the memory cell <b>3402</b> of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b> plays a part in the mechanical position of the mirror <b>3208</b>. However, loading information within the memory cell <b>3402</b> does not automatically change the mechanical state of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0226\" num=\"0192\">Although the state of the dual CMOS memory elements <b>3404</b> plays a part in determining the state of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b>, the state of the memory elements <b>3304</b> is not the sole determining factor. Once the micro-mirror <b>3208</b> has landed, changing the state of the memory cells <b>3402</b> will not cause the micro-mirror <b>3208</b> to flip to the other state. Thus, the memory state and the micro-mirror state are not directly linked together. In order for the state of the CMOS memory elements <b>3404</b> to be transferred to the mechanical position of the micro-mirror <b>3208</b>, the micro-mirror <b>3108</b> must receive a \u201cMirror Clocking Pulse\u201d signal. The mirror clocking pulse signal momentarily releases the micro-mirror <b>3108</b> and causes the mirror to reposition based on the state of the CMOS memory elements <b>3304</b>. Thus, information relating to mirror positions may be preloaded into the memory element <b>3404</b>, and the mechanical position of the mirror <b>3302</b> for each mirror within a MEMs device <b>3202</b> simultaneously change responsive to the mirror clocking pulse signal. One manner in which the information within the memory cells <b>3402</b> may be programmed is through the use of holograms, such as those described herein that are used to defined the position of each of the micro-mirrors <b>3208</b> with and a MEMs device <b>3202</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0227\" num=\"0193\">When a DMD <b>3202</b> is \u201cpowered up\u201d or \u201cpowered down,\u201d there are prescribed operations that are necessary to ensure the proper orientation of the micro-mirrors <b>3208</b>. These operations position the micro-mirrors <b>3208</b> during power up and release them during power down. The process for changing the position of a micro-mirror <b>3208</b> is more particularly illustrated in the flowchart of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 35</figref>. Initially, at step <b>3502</b>, the memory states within the memory cells <b>3402</b> are set. Once the memory states have been set within the memory cells <b>3402</b>, the mirror clock pulse signal may be applied at step <b>3504</b>. The micro-mirror <b>3108</b> will have an established specification of the time before and after a mirror clocking pulse that data may be loaded into the memory cell <b>3402</b>. Application of the mirror clocking pulse signal will then set the mirrors to their new state established by the memory at step <b>3506</b>. The process is completed at step <b>3508</b>, and the mirror <b>3302</b> position is fixed and new data may be loaded into the memory cell <b>3402</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0228\" num=\"0194\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 36</figref>, there is illustrated an intensity and phase interferometer for measuring the intensity and phase of the generated beam. One can generate spatial modes by loading computer-generated Matlab holograms <b>3602</b> such as those described herein above and illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 31A-31H</figref> onto a DMD memory. The holograms <b>3602</b> for generating modes can be created by modulating a grating function with 20 micro-mirrors per each period. The holograms <b>3602</b> are provided to a DMD <b>3604</b>. An imaging system <b>3606</b> along with an aperture <b>3608</b> separates the first order diffracted light into separate modes. The imaging system includes a laser <b>3610</b> that provides a light through a pair of lenses <b>3612</b>, <b>3614</b>. The lens <b>3612</b> expands the light beam to lens <b>3614</b> which collimates the beam. A beam splitter <b>3616</b> splits the beam toward a lens <b>3618</b> and mirror <b>3621</b>. Lens <b>3618</b> focuses the beam through lens <b>3620</b> which collimates the beam through a filter <b>3622</b>. The filtered beam is reflected by mirror <b>3624</b> through a second beam splitter <b>3626</b>. The beam splitter <b>3626</b> splits the beam toward a lens <b>3628</b> and a charge coupled device camera <b>3630</b>. The charge coupled device (CCD) camera <b>3630</b> measures the intensity profile of the generated beam. The plane wave beam provided to lens <b>3628</b> is focused on to the aperture <b>3608</b> to interfere with the twisted beam from the DMD. Also focused on the aperture <b>3608</b> is the twisted beam from the DMD <b>3604</b>. The beam from the DMD <b>3604</b> is provided through a lens <b>3632</b> that also focuses on the aperture <b>3608</b>. The phase of the mode being generated is determined from the number of spirals in the pattern and is caused by interfering the twisted beam with a plane wave beam. Also, whether the phase is positive or negative may be determined by whether the spirals are clockwise (positive) or counter-clockwise (negative). A Mach-Zehnder interferometer may be used to verify the phase pattern of the created beams. The collimated plane wave provided from lens <b>3628</b> is interfered with the modes generated by the beam from the DMD <b>3604</b> through lens <b>3632</b>. This generates the interferograms (spiral patterns) at the aperture <b>3608</b>. The modes generated from the DMD may then be multiplexed together using memory-based static forks on the DLP.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0229\" num=\"0195\">Therefore, there is a possibility of using binary holograms to coherently control both phase and amplitude of a light beam. A low number of pixels per each period of the binary grating results in quantization errors in encoding phase and intensity. The total number of grating periods with in the incident beam on the DMD <b>3604</b> sets an upper limit on the spatial bandwidth of the generated modes. Consequently a large number of micro-mirrors is preferable for generating high-quality modes. This can be achieved by using newer generations of DMDs. Another set of modes that are needed for OAM-based quantum key distribution is the set of angular (ANG) modes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0230\" num=\"0196\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 37</figref>, there is illustrated the manner in which switching between different OAM modes may be achieved in real time. The laser <b>3702</b> generates a collimated beam through lenses <b>3704</b> and <b>3706</b> to a DMD <b>3708</b>. The DMD <b>3708</b> provides a beam that is focused by lens <b>3710</b> onto aperture <b>3712</b>. The output from the aperture <b>3712</b> is provided to a lens <b>3714</b> that collimates the beam onto a mirror <b>3716</b>. The collimated beam is provided to an OAM sorter <b>3718</b> that separates the signal into various OAM modes <b>3720</b> as detected by a computer <b>3722</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0231\" num=\"0197\">Using DMDs for generating OAM modes provides the ability to switch between different modes at very high speeds. This involves a much smaller number of optical elements as compared to the conventional techniques were OAM modes are generated using a series of separated forked holograms and are multiplexed using beam splitters. Therefore, one can achieve dynamic switching among vortex OAM modes with different quantum numbers. The computer-generated holograms for these modes must be loaded onto the memory of the DMD <b>3708</b>, and the switching is achieved by using a clock signal. One can use a mode sorter to map the input modes to a series of separated spots. The intensity may then be measured corresponding to each mode using a high-bandwidth PIN detector at positions corresponding to each mode. The DMD devices are available for a fraction of the cost of phase only spatial light modulators.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0232\" num=\"0198\">The DMD efficiency observed in a specific application depends on application-specific design variables such as illumination wavelength, illumination angle, projection aperture size, overfill of the DMD micro-mirror array and so on. Overall optical efficiency of each DMD can generally be estimated as a product of window transmission, a diffraction efficiency, micro-mirror surface reflectivity and array fill factor. The first three factors depend on the wavelength of the illumination source.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0233\" num=\"0199\">DLP technology uses two types of materials for DMD mirrors. The mirror material for all DMD&#39;s except Type-A is Corning Eagle XG, whereas type A DMDs use Corning 7056. Both mirror types have an anti-reflectivity (AR), thin-film coating on both the top and the bottom of the window glass material. AR coatings reduce reflections and increase transmission efficiency. The DMD mirrors are designed for three transmission regions. These ranges include the ultraviolet light region from 300 nm to 400 nm, the visible light region from 400 nm to 700 nm and the near infrared light region (NIR) from 700 nm to 2500 nm. The coating used depends on the application. UV windows have special AR coatings designed to be more transmissive for ultraviolet wavelengths, visible coatings for visible DMDs and NIR coatings for NIR DMDs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0234\" num=\"0200\">The measured data provided in the following sections reflects a typical single pass transmittance through both top and bottom AR coated mirror surfaces with random polarization. The angle of incidence (AOI) of 0\u00b0 is measured perpendicular to the window surface unless mentioned otherwise. With an increase in the number of window passes, the efficiency would decline.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0235\" num=\"0201\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 38</figref> represents the window transmission curves for Corning 7056. The window transmission response curve in this figure applies to Taipei MDM&#39;s in their specified illumination wavelength regions. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 38</figref> shows the UV window transmittance measured perpendicular to the window surface and visible window transmittance at a lie of 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 39-43</figref> are zoomed in views of the typical visible and UV AR coated window transmittance in their maximum transmission regions. The visible Corning Eagle XG window transmission data shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 42</figref> applies to the DLP <b>5500</b>, DLP <b>1700</b>, DLP <b>3000</b> and DLP <b>3000</b> DMD&#39;s. The typical transmittance observed in these DMD&#39;s is broadband visible region is approximately 97%. The NIR Corning Eagle XG window transmission data of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 43</figref> applies to the DLP <b>3000</b> NIR DMD. The typical transmittance observed in the NIR DMD&#39;s in the broadband NIR region is approximately 96% for most of the region with a dip toward 90% as it nears 2500 nm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0236\" num=\"0202\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 44</figref>, there is illustrated a configuration of generation circuitry for the generation of an OAM twisted beam using a hologram within a micro-electrical mechanical device. A laser <b>4402</b> generates a beam having a wavelength of approximately 543 nm. This beam is focused through a telescope <b>4404</b> and lens <b>4406</b> onto a mirror/system of mirrors <b>4408</b>. The beam is reflected from the mirrors <b>4408</b> into a DMD <b>4410</b>. The DMD <b>4410</b> has programmed in to its memory a one or more forked holograms <b>4412</b> that generate a desired OAM twisted beam <b>4413</b> having any desired information encoded into the OAM modes of the beam that is detected by a CCD <b>4414</b>. The holograms <b>4412</b> are loaded into the memory of the DMD <b>4410</b> and displayed as a static image. In the case of 1024\u00d7768 DMD array, the images must comprise 1024 by 768 images. The control software of the DMD <b>4410</b> converts the holograms into .bmp files. The holograms may be displayed singly or as multiple holograms displayed together in order to multiplex particular OAM modes onto a single beam. The manner of generating the hologram <b>4412</b> within the DMD <b>4410</b> may be implemented in a number of fashions that provide qualitative differences between the generated OAM beam <b>4413</b>. Phase and amplitude information may be encoded into a beam by modulating the position and width of a binary amplitude grating used as a hologram. By realizing such holograms on a DMD the creation of HG modes, LG modes, OAM vortex mode or any angular mode may be realized. Furthermore, by performing switching of the generated modes at a very high speed, information may be encoded within the helicity&#39;s that are dynamically changing to provide a new type of helicity modulation. Spatial modes may be generated by loading computer-generated holograms onto a DMD. These holograms can be created by modulating a grating function with 20 micro mirrors per each period.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0237\" num=\"0203\">Rather than just generating an OAM beam <b>4413</b> having only a single OAM value included therein, multiple OAM values may be multiplexed into the OAM beam in a variety of manners as described herein below. The use of multiple OAM values allows for the incorporation of different information into the light beam. Programmable structured light provided by the DLP allows for the projection of custom and adaptable patterns. These patterns may be programmed into the memory of the DLP and used for imparting different information through the light beam. Furthermore, if these patterns are clocked dynamically a modulation scheme may be created where the information is encoded in the helicities of the structured beams.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0238\" num=\"0204\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 45</figref>, rather than just having the laser beam <b>4502</b> shine on a single hologram multiple holograms <b>4504</b> may be generated by the DMD <b>4410</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 45</figref> illustrates an implementation wherein a 4\u00d73 array of holograms <b>4504</b> are generated by the DMD <b>4410</b>. The holograms <b>4504</b> are square and each edge of a hologram lines up with an edge of an adjacent hologram to create the 4\u00d73 array. The OAM values provided by each of the holograms <b>4504</b> are multiplexed together by shining the beam <b>4502</b> onto the array of holograms <b>4504</b>. Several configurations of the holograms <b>4504</b> may be used in order to provide differing qualities of the OAM beam <b>4413</b> and associated modes generated by passing a light beam through the array of holograms <b>4504</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0239\" num=\"0205\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 46</figref> there is illustrated an alternative way of multiplexing various OAM modes together. An X by Y array of holograms <b>4602</b> has each of the hologram <b>4602</b> placed upon a black (dark) background <b>4604</b> in order to segregate the various modes from each other. In another configuration illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 47</figref>, the holograms <b>4702</b> are placed in a hexagonal configuration with the background in the off (black) state in order to better segregate the modes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0240\" num=\"0206\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 48</figref> illustrates yet another technique for multiplexing multiple OAM modes together wherein the holograms <b>4802</b> are cycled through in a loop sequence by the DMD <b>4410</b>. In this example modes T<sub>0</sub>-T<sub>11 </sub>are cycled through and the process repeats by returning back to mode T<sub>0</sub>. This process repeats in a continuous loop in order to provide an OAM twisted beam with each of the modes multiplex therein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0241\" num=\"0207\">In addition to providing integer OAM modes using holograms within the DMD, fractional OAM modes may also be presented by the DMD using fractional binary forks as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 49</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 49</figref> illustrates fractional binary forks for generating fractional OAM modes of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.25, 1.50 and 1.75 with a light beam.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0242\" num=\"0208\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 50-63</figref>, there are illustrated the results achieved from various configurations of holograms program within the memory of a DMD. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates the configuration at <b>5002</b> having no hologram separation on a white background producing the OAM mode image <b>5004</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 51</figref> uses a configuration <b>5102</b> consisting of circular holograms <b>5004</b> having separation on a white background. The OAM mode image <b>5006</b> that is provided therefrom is also illustrated. Bright mode separation yields less light and better mode separation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0243\" num=\"0209\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 52</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>5202</b> having square holograms with no separation on a black background. The configuration <b>5202</b> generates the OAM mode image <b>5204</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 53</figref> illustrates the configuration of circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) that are separated on a black background. This yields the OAM mode image <b>5304</b>. Dark mode separation yields more light in the OAM image <b>5304</b> and has slightly better mode separation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0244\" num=\"0210\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 54</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>5402</b> having a bright background and circular hologram (radius \u02dc256 pixels) separation yielding an OAM mode image <b>5404</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 55</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>5502</b> using circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) having separation on a black background to yield the OAM mode image <b>5504</b>. The dark mode separation yields more light and has a slightly worse mode separation within the OAM mode images.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0245\" num=\"0211\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 56</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>5602</b> including circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a bright background yielding an OAM mode image <b>5604</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 57</figref> illustrates at <b>5702</b> small circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a bright background that yields and OAM mode image <b>5704</b>. The larger holograms with brighter backgrounds yield better OAM mode separation images.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0246\" num=\"0212\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 58</figref>, there is illustrated a configuration <b>5802</b> of circular holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution on a dark background with each of the holograms having a radius of approximately 256 pixels. This configuration <b>5802</b> yields the OAM mode image <b>5804</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 59</figref> illustrates the use of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) having a radius of approximately 190 pixels arranged in a hexagonal distribution on a black background that yields the OAM mode image <b>5904</b>. Larger holograms (radius of approximately 256 pixels) having a dark background yields worse OAM mode separation within the OAM mode images.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0247\" num=\"0213\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 60</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>6002</b> of small holograms (radius of approximately 190 pixels) in a hexagonal separated distribution on a dark background that yields the OAM mode image <b>6004</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>6102</b> of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a hexagonal distribution that are close together on a dark background that yields the OAM mode image <b>6104</b>. The larger dark boundaries (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 60</figref>) yield worse OAM mode image separation than a smaller dark boundary.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0248\" num=\"0214\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 62</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>6202</b> of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) in a separated hexagonal configuration on a bright background yielding OAM mode image <b>6204</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 63</figref> illustrates a configuration <b>6302</b> of small holograms (radius \u02dc256 pixels) more closely spaced in a hexagonal configuration on a bright background yielding OAM mode image <b>6304</b>. The larger bright boundaries (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 62</figref>) yield a better OAM mode separation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0249\" num=\"0215\">Additional illustrations of holograms, namely reduced binary holograms are illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 64-67</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 64</figref> illustrates reduced binary holograms having a radius equal to 100 micro mirrors and a period of 50 for various OAM modes. Similarly, OAM modes are illustrated for reduced binary for holograms having a radius of 50 micro mirrors and a period of 50 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 65</figref>); a radius of 100 micro mirrors and a period of 100 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 66</figref>) and a radius of 50 micro mirrors and a period of 50 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 67</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0250\" num=\"0216\">The illustrated data with respect to the holograms of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 50-67</figref> demonstrates that full forked gratings yield a great deal of scattered light. Finer forked gratings yield better define modes within OAM images. By removing unnecessary light from the hologram (white regions) there is a reduction in scatter. Holograms that are larger and have fewer features (more dark zones) having a hologram diameter of 200 micro mirrors provide overlapping modes and strong intensity. Similar configurations using 100 micro mirrors also demonstrate overlapping modes and strong intensity. Smaller holograms having smaller radii between 100-200 micro mirrors and periods between 50 and 100 generated by a DLP produce better defined modes and have stronger intensity than larger holograms with larger radii in periods. Smaller holograms having more features (dark zones with hologram diameters of 200 micro mirrors provide well-defined modes with strong intensity. However, hundred micro mirror diameter holograms while providing well-defined modes provide weaker intensity. Thus, good, compact hologram sizes are between 100-200 micro mirrors with zone periods of between 50 and 100. Larger holograms have been shown to provide a richer OAM topology.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0251\" num=\"0217\">Additional methods of providing multimode OAM generation by implementing multiple holograms within a MEMs device are illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 68</figref>. These configurations of holograms illustrate the hologram configurations and associated OAM mode images for mode combinations from l=1 to l=1,2,3,4,5,6,7.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0252\" num=\"0218\">In addition to the binary forked holograms discussed hereinabove, the Matlab capability of the DMD also enables the generation of binary spiral holograms of differing mode levels. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 69</figref> illustrates binary spiral holograms for l=1 and l=20.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0253\" num=\"0219\">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that this system and method for applying orthogonal limitations to light beams using microelectromechanical systems provides improved mode data transmission capability.

No. 15/709,220 for \u201cNatural Language Processing Using A CNN Based Integrated Circuit\u201d filed on Sep. 19, 2017. \\n     This application also claims priority to a co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/617,190, entitled \u201cApproximated Fully-Connected Layers Using 3\u00d73 Covolutional Operations In A CNN Based Digital Integrated Circuit\u201d filed on Feb. 6, 2018. All of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. \\n    \\n    \\n     FIELD \\n     The invention generally relates to the field of machine learning and more particularly to approximating operations of fully-connected layers with multiple arrays of 3\u00d73 convolutional filter kernels in a Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) based digital integrated circuit. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     Cellular Neural Networks or Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNN) have been applied to many different fields and problems including, but limited to, image processing since 1988. However, most of the prior art CNN approaches are either based on software solutions (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.) or based on hardware that are designed for other purposes (e.g., graphic processing, general computation, etc.). As a result, CNN prior approaches are too slow in term of computational speed and/or too expensive thereby impractical for processing large amount of imagery data. The imagery data can be from any two-dimensional data (e.g., still photo, picture, a frame of a video stream, converted form of voice data, etc.). \\n     Traditional deep learning network architecture for classifying two-dimensional input imagery data generally contains two parts: ordered convolutional layers followed by fully-connected (FC) layers. Notably, ordered convolutional layers require less storage for holding filter coefficients but require significantly larger amounts of computation for \u2018multiplication-add\u2019s (Mult-Adds) (e.g., VGG16 requires 15 TFLOPs) due to the repeated applications of convolutional filter kernels. On the contrary, FC layers require less computations for Mult-Adds but necessitate a significant amount of storage (e.g., VGG16 requires storage for about 123 millions of FC layer weights/coefficients) for storing coefficients due to inner-products (i.e., respective multiplications between FC layer weights and nodal feature values obtained in the previous level). With operations of ordered convolutional layers performed in a CNN based integrated circuit, the computation bottleneck in deep learning networks is in FC layers. Since FC layers require large amount of storage, prior art approaches have been using computational devices outside of the CNN based integrated circuit, for example CPU (central processing unit) or GPU (graphics processing unit). \\n     It would therefore be desirable to have systems and methods of performing image classification task within in a CNN based integrated circuit entirely. \\n     SUMMARY \\n     This section is for the purpose of summarizing some aspects of the invention and to briefly introduce some preferred embodiments. Simplifications or omissions in this section as well as in the abstract and the title herein may be made to avoid obscuring the purpose of the section. Such simplifications or omissions are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. \\n     Methods and systems for approximating operations of fully-connected (FC) layers with multiple 3\u00d73 convolutional filter kernels are disclosed. As a result, image classification task is entirely performed within a CNN based integrated circuit According to one aspect of the disclosure, Multiple arrays of 3\u00d73 filter kernels are used for approximating operations of fully-connected (FC) layers. The output at the end of ordered convolutional layers contains P feature maps with F\u00d7F pixels of data per feature map. 3\u00d73 filter kernels comprises L layers with each organized in an array of R\u00d7Q of 3\u00d73 filter kernels, Q and R are respective numbers of input and output feature maps of a particular layer of the L layers. Each input feature map of the particular layer comprises F\u00d7F pixels of data with one-pixel padding added around its perimeter. Each output feature map of the particular layer comprises (F\u22122)\u00d7(F\u22122) pixels of useful data. Useful data are located in center portion of respective feature maps, when one-pixel padding is added around the perimeter of each feature map for convolutional operations. When no padding scheme is used, the size of feature maps shrinks by two pixels in each direction after each of the L layers. Output of the last layer of the L layers contains Z classes. L equals to (F\u22121)/2 if F is an odd positive number. P, F, Q, R and Z are positive integers. In one embodiment, methods for approximating operations of fully-FC layers s are implemented in a Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) based digital integrated circuit. \\n     According to another aspect of the disclosure, a digital integrated circuit contains cellular neural networks (CNN) processing engines operatively coupled to at least one input/output data bus. The CNN processing engines are connected in a loop with a clock-skew circuit. Each CNN processing engine includes a CNN processing block configured for simultaneously performing convolutional operations using input data and pre-trained filter coefficients of a plurality of ordered convolutional layers. CNN processing block is further configured for classifying the input data using a plurality of 3\u00d73 filter kernels to approximate operations of fully-connected (FC) layers. The first set of memory buffers operatively couples to the CNN processing block for storing the input data. The second set of memory buffers operative couples to the CNN processing block for storing the pre-trained filter coefficients. \\n     Objects, features, and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon examining the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, taken in conjunction with the attached drawings. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will be better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings as follows: \\n         FIGS. 1A-1B  are block diagrams illustrating an example integrated circuit designed for extracting features from input imagery data in accordance with one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 2  is a function block diagram showing an example controller configured for controlling operations of one or more CNN processing engines according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 3  is a diagram showing an example CNN processing engine in accordance with one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 4  is a diagram showing M\u00d7M pixel locations within a (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region, according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIGS. 5A-5C  are diagrams showing three example pixel locations, according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 6  is a diagram illustrating an example data arrangement for performing 3\u00d73 convolutions at a pixel location, according to one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 7  is a function block diagram illustrating an example circuitry for performing 3\u00d73 convolutions at a pixel location, according to one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 8  is a diagram showing an example rectification according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIGS. 9A-9B  are diagrams showing two example 2\u00d72 pooling operations according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 10  is a diagram illustrating a 2\u00d72 pooling operation reduces M-pixel by M-pixel block to a (M/2)-pixel by (M/2)-pixel block in accordance with one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIGS. 11A-11C  are diagrams illustrating examples of M-pixel by M-pixel blocks and corresponding (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region in an input image, according to one embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 12  is a diagram illustrating an example of a first set of memory buffers for storing received imagery data in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 13A  is a diagram showing two operational modes of an example second set of memory buffers for storing filter coefficients in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 13B  is a diagram showing example storage schemes of filter coefficients in the second set of memory buffers, according to an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 14  is a diagram showing a plurality of CNN processing engines connected as a loop via an example clock-skew circuit in accordance of an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 15  is a schematic diagram showing an example image processing technique based on convolutional neural networks in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 16  is a flowchart illustrating an example process of achieving a trained convolutional neural networks model having bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 17  is a diagram showing an example filter kernel conversion scheme in accordance with the invention; \\n         FIG. 18  is a diagram showing an example data conversion scheme; \\n         FIGS. 19A-19B  are diagrams showing an example image classification task using a deep learning network that includes convolutional layers followed by fully-connected layers in an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 20  is a schematic diagram showing example arrays of 3\u00d73 filter kernels for approximating operations of FC layers in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; and \\n         FIGS. 21A-21B  are schematic diagrams showing example inner-product replacement array of 3\u00d73 filter kernels in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS \\n     In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention.

However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments. \\n     Referring first to  FIG. 1A , it is shown a block diagram illustrating an example digital integrated circuit (IC)  100  for extracting features out of an input image in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. \\n     The integrated circuit  100  is implemented as a digital semi-conductor chip and contains a CNN processing engine controller  110 , and one or more neural networks (CNN) processing engines  102  operatively coupled to at least one input/output (I/O) data bus  120 . Controller  110  is configured to control various operations of the CNN processing engines  102  for extracting features out of an input image based on an image processing technique by performing multiple layers of 3\u00d73 convolutions with rectifications or other nonlinear operations (e.g., sigmoid function), and 2\u00d72 pooling operations. To perform 3\u00d73 convolutions requires imagery data in digital form and corresponding filter coefficients, which are supplied to the CNN processing engine  102  via input/output data bus  120 . It is well known that digital semi-conductor chip contains logic gates, multiplexers, register files, memories, state machines, etc. \\n     According to one embodiment, the digital integrated circuit  100  is extendable and scalable. For example, multiple copy of the digital integrated circuit  100  can be implemented on one semiconductor chip. \\n     All of the CNN processing engines are identical. For illustrating simplicity, only few (i.e., CNN processing engines  122   a - 122   h ,  132   a - 132   h ) are shown in  FIG. 1B . The invention sets no limit to the number of CNN processing engines on a digital semi-conductor chip. \\n     Each CNN processing engine  122   a - 122   h ,  132   a - 132   h  contains a CNN processing block  124 , a first set of memory buffers  126  and a second set of memory buffers  128 .

The second set of memory buffers  128  is configured for storing filter coefficients and for supplying the already received filter coefficients to the CNN processing block  124 . In general, the number of CNN processing engines on a chip is 2 n , where n is an integer (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ). As shown in  FIG. 1B , CNN processing engines  122   a - 122   h  are operatively coupled to a first input/output data bus  130   a  while CNN processing engines  132   a - 132   h  are operatively coupled to a second input/output data bus  130   b . Each input/output data bus  130   a - 130   b  is configured for independently transmitting data (i.e., imagery data and filter coefficients). In one embodiment, the first and the second sets of memory buffers comprise random access memory (RAM). Each of the first and the second sets are logically defined. In other words, respective sizes of the first and the second sets can be reconfigured to accommodate respective amounts of imagery data and filter coefficients. \\n     The first and the second I/O data bus  130   a - 130   b  are shown here to connect the CNN processing engines  122   a - 122   h ,  132   a - 132   h  in a sequential scheme. In another embodiment, the at least one I/O data bus may have different connection scheme to the CNN processing engines to accomplish the same purpose of parallel data input and output for improving performance. \\n       FIG. 2  is a diagram showing an example controller  200  for controlling various operations of at least one CNN processing engine configured on the integrated circuit. Controller  200  comprises circuitry to control imagery data loading control  212 , filter coefficients loading control  214 , imagery data output control  216 , and image processing operations control  218 . Controller  200  further includes register files  220  for storing the specific configuration (e.g., number of CNN processing engines, number of input/output data bus, etc.) in the integrated circuit. \\n     Image data loading control  212  controls loading of imagery data to respective CNN processing engines via the corresponding I/O data bus. Filter coefficients loading control  214  controls loading of filter coefficients to respective CNN processing engines via corresponding I/O data bus. Imagery data output control  216  controls output of the imagery data from respective CNN processing engines via corresponding I/O data bus. Image processing operations control  218  controls various operations such as convolutions, rectifications and pooling operations which can be defined by user of the integrated circuit via a set of user defined directives (e.g., file contains a series of operations such as convolution, rectification, pooling, etc.). \\n     More details of a CNN processing engine  302  are shown in  FIG. 3 . A CNN processing block  304  contains digital circuitry that simultaneously obtains M\u00d7M convolutional operations results by performing 3\u00d73 convolutions at M\u00d7M pixel locations using imagery data of a (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region and corresponding filter coefficients from the respective memory buffers. The (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region is formed with the M\u00d7M pixel locations as an M-pixel by M-pixel central portion plus a one-pixel border surrounding the central portion. M is a positive integer. In one embodiment, M equals to 14 and therefore, (M+2) equals to 16, M\u00d7M equals to 14\u00d714=196, and M/2 equals 7. \\n       FIG. 4  is a diagram showing a diagram representing (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region  410  with a central portion of M\u00d7M pixel locations  420  used in the CNN processing engine  302 . \\n     Imagery data may represent characteristics of a pixel in the input image (e.g., one of the color (e.g., RGB (red, green, blue)) values of the pixel, or distance between pixel and observing location). Generally, the value of the RGB is an integer between 0 and 255. Values of filter coefficients are floating point integer numbers that can be either positive or negative. \\n     In order to achieve faster computations, few computational performance improvement techniques have been used and implemented in the CNN processing block  304 . In one embodiment, representation of imagery data uses as few bits as practical (e.g., 5-bit representation). In another embodiment, each filter coefficient is represented as an integer with a radix point. Similarly, the integer representing the filter coefficient uses as few bits as practical (e.g., 12-bit representation). As a result, 3\u00d73 convolutions can then be performed using fixed-point arithmetic for faster computations. \\n     Each 3\u00d73 convolution produces one convolutional operations result, Out(m, n), based on the following formula: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     Out \\n                     \\ue8a0 \\n                     \\n                       ( \\n                       \\n                         m \\n                         , \\n                         n \\n                       \\n                       ) \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   = \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \u2211 \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             1 \\n                             \u2264 \\n                             i \\n                           \\n                           , \\n                           \\n                             j \\n                             \u2264 \\n                             3 \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       \\n                           \\n                       \\n                       \\ue89e \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           In \\n                           \\ue8a0 \\n                           \\n                             ( \\n                             \\n                               m \\n                               , \\n                               n \\n                               , \\n                               i \\n                               , \\n                               j \\n                             \\n                             ) \\n                           \\n                         \\n                         \u00d7 \\n                         \\n                           C \\n                           \\ue8a0 \\n                           \\n                             ( \\n                             \\n                               i \\n                               , \\n                               j \\n                             \\n                             ) \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     - \\n                     b \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n               \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   1 \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     where:\\n         m, n are corresponding row and column numbers for identifying which imagery data (pixel) within the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region the convolution is performed;   In(m,n,i,j) is a 3-pixel by 3-pixel area centered at pixel location (m, n) within the region;   C(i, j) represents one of the nine weight coefficients C(3\u00d73), each corresponds to one of the 3-pixel by 3-pixel area;   b represents an offset coefficient; and   j are indices of weight coefficients C(i, j).       \\n\\n     Each CNN processing block  304  produces M\u00d7M convolutional operations results simultaneously and, all CNN processing engines perform simultaneous operations. \\n       FIGS. 5A-5C  show three different examples of the M\u00d7M pixel locations. The first pixel location  531  shown in  FIG. 5A  is in the center of a 3-pixel by 3-pixel area within the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region at the upper left corner. The second pixel location  532  shown in  FIG. 5B  is one pixel data shift to the right of the first pixel location  531 . The third pixel location  533  shown in  FIG. 5C  is a typical example pixel location. M\u00d7M pixel locations contains multiple overlapping 3-pixel by 3-pixel areas within the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region. \\n     To perform 3\u00d73 convolutions at each sampling location, an example data arrangement is shown in  FIG. 6 . Imagery data (i.e., In(3\u00d73)) and filter coefficients (i.e., weight coefficients C(3\u00d73) and an offset coefficient b) are fed into an example CNN 3\u00d73 circuitry  600 . After 3\u00d73 convolutions operation in accordance with Formula (1), one output result (i.e., Out(1\u00d71)) is produced. At each sampling location, the imagery data In(3\u00d73) is centered at pixel coordinates (m, n)  605  with eight immediate neighbor pixels  601 - 604 ,  606 - 609 . \\n       FIG. 7  is a function diagram showing an example CNN 3\u00d73 circuitry  700  for performing 3\u00d73 convolutions at each pixel location. The circuitry  700  contains at least adder  721 , multiplier  722 , shifter  723 , rectifier  724  and pooling operator  725 . In a digital semi-conductor implementation, all of these can be achieved with logic gates and multiplexers, which are generated using well-known methods (e.g., hardware description language such as Verilog, etc.). Adder  721  and multiplier  722  are used for addition and multiplication operations. Shifter  723  is for shifting the output result in accordance with fixed-point arithmetic involved in the 3\u00d73 convolutions. Rectifier  724  is for setting negative output results to zero. Pooling operator  725  is for performing 2\u00d72 pooling operations. \\n     Imagery data are stored in a first set of memory buffers  306 , while filter coefficients are stored in a second set of memory buffers  308 . Both imagery data and filter coefficients are fed to the CNN block  304  at each clock of the digital integrated circuit. Filter coefficients (i.e., C(3\u00d73) and b) are fed into the CNN processing block  304  directly from the second set of memory buffers  308 . However, imagery data are fed into the CNN processing block  304  via a multiplexer MUX  305  from the first set of memory buffers  306 . Multiplexer  305  selects imagery data from the first set of memory buffers based on a clock signal (e.g., pulse  312 ). \\n     Otherwise, multiplexer MUX  305  selects imagery data from a first neighbor CNN processing engine (from the left side of  FIG. 3  not shown) through a clock-skew circuit  320 . \\n     At the same time, a copy of the imagery data fed into the CNN processing block  304  is sent to a second neighbor CNN processing engine (to the right side of  FIG. 3  not shown) via the clock-skew circuit  320 . Clock-skew circuit  320  can be achieved with known techniques (e.g., a D flip-flop  322 ). \\n     The first neighbor CNN processing engine may be referred to as an upstream neighbor CNN processing engine in the loop formed by the clock-skew circuit  320 . The second neighbor CNN processing engine may be referred to as a downstream CNN processing engine. In another embodiment, when the data flow direction of the clock-skew circuit is reversed, the first and the second CNN processing engines are also reversed becoming downstream and upstream neighbors, respectively. \\n     After 3\u00d73 convolutions for each group of imagery data are performed for predefined number of filter coefficients, convolutional operations results Out(m, n) are sent to the first set of memory buffers via another multiplex MUX  307  based on another clock signal (e.g., pulse  311 ). An example clock cycle  310  is drawn for demonstrating the time relationship between pulse  311  and pulse  312 . As shown pulse  311  is one clock before pulse  312 , results of the 3\u00d73 convolutional operations are stored into the first set of memory buffers after a particular block of imagery data has been processed by all CNN processing engines through the clock-skew circuit  320 . \\n     After the convolutional operations result Out(m, n) is obtained from Formula (1), rectification procedure may be performed as directed by image processing control  218 . Any convolutional operations result, Out(m, n), less than zero (i.e., negative value) is set to zero. In other words, only positive value of output results are kept.  FIG. 8  shows two example outcomes of rectification. A positive output value 10.5 retains as 10.5 while \u22122.3 becomes 0. Rectification causes non-linearity in the integrated circuits. \\n     If a 2\u00d72 pooling operation is required, the M\u00d7M output results are reduced to (M/2)\u00d7(M/2). In order to store the (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) output results in corresponding locations in the first set of memory buffers, additional bookkeeping techniques are required to track proper memory addresses such that four (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) output results can be processed in one CNN processing engine. \\n     To demonstrate a 2\u00d72 pooling operation,  FIG. 9A  is a diagram graphically showing first example output results of a 2-pixel by 2-pixel block being reduced to a single value 10.5, which is the largest value of the four output results. The technique shown in  FIG. 9A  is referred to as \u201cmax pooling\u201d. When the average value 4.6 of the four output results is used for the single value shown in  FIG. 9B , it is referred to as \u201caverage pooling\u201d. There are other pooling operations, for example, \u201cmixed max average pooling\u201d which is a combination of \u201cmax pooling\u201d and \u201caverage pooling\u201d. The main goal of the pooling operation is to reduce size of the imagery data being processed.  FIG. 10  is a diagram illustrating M\u00d7M pixel locations, through a 2\u00d72 pooling operation, are reduced to (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) locations, which is one fourth of the original size. \\n     An input image generally contains a large amount of imagery data. In order to perform image processing operations. The input image  1100  is partitioned into M-pixel by M-pixel blocks  1111 - 1112  as shown in  FIG. 11A . Imagery data associated with each of these M-pixel by M-pixel blocks is then fed into respective CNN processing engines. At each of the M\u00d7M pixel locations in a particular M-pixel by M-pixel block, 3\u00d73 convolutions are simultaneously performed in the corresponding CNN processing block. \\n     Although the invention does not require specific characteristic dimension of an input image, the input image may be required to resize to fit to a predefined characteristic dimension for certain image processing procedures. In an embodiment, a square shape with (2 K \u00d7M)-pixel by (2 K \u00d7M)-pixel is required. K is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). When M equals 14 and K equals 4, the characteristic dimension is 224. In another embodiment, the input image is a rectangular shape with dimensions of (2 I xM)-pixel and (2 1 \u00d7M)-pixel, where I and J are positive integers. \\n     In order to properly perform 3\u00d73 convolutions at pixel locations around the border of a M-pixel by M-pixel block, additional imagery data from neighboring blocks are required.  FIG. 11B  shows a typical M-pixel by M-pixel block  1120  (bordered with dotted lines) within a (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region  1130 . The (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region is formed by a central portion of M-pixel by M-pixel from the current block, and four edges (i.e., top, right, bottom and left) and four corners (i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left) from corresponding neighboring blocks. Additional details are shown in  FIG. 12  and corresponding descriptions for the first set of memory buffers. \\n       FIG. 11C  shows two example M-pixel by M-pixel blocks  1122 - 1124  and respective associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel regions  1132 - 1134 . These two example blocks  1122 - 1124  are located along the perimeter of the input image. The first example M-pixel by M-pixel block  1122  is located at top-left corner, therefore, the first example block  1122  has neighbors for two edges and one corner. Value \u201c0\u201ds are used for the two edges and three corners without neighbors (shown as shaded area) in the associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region  1132  for forming imagery data. Similarly, the associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region  1134  of the second example block  1124  requires \u201c0\u201ds be used for the top edge and two top corners. Other blocks along the perimeter of the input image are treated similarly. In other words, for the purpose to perform 3\u00d73 convolutions at each pixel of the input image, a layer of zeros (\u201c0\u201d s) is added outside of the perimeter of the input image. This can be achieved with many well-known techniques. For example, default values of the first set of memory buffers are set to zero. If no imagery data is filled in from the neighboring blocks, those edges and corners would contain zeros. \\n     Furthermore, an input image can contain a large amount of imagery data, which may not be able to be fed into the CNN processing engines in its entirety. Therefore, the first set of memory buffers is configured on the respective CNN processing engines for storing a portion of the imagery data of the input image. The first set of memory buffers contains nine different data buffers graphically illustrated in  FIG. 12 . Nine buffers are designed to match the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region as follows: \\n     1) buffer-0 for storing M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the central portion;\\n \\n2) buffer-1 for storing 1\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the top edge;\\n \\n3) buffer-2 for storing M\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the right edge;\\n \\n4) buffer-3 for storing 1\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the bottom edge;\\n \\n5) buffer-4 for storing M\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the left edge;\\n \\n6) buffer-5 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the top left corner;\\n \\n7) buffer-6 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the top right corner;\\n \\n8) buffer-7 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the bottom right corner;\\n \\nand\\n \\n9) buffer-8 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the bottom left corner.\\n \\n     Imagery data received from the I/O data bus are in form of M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data in consecutive blocks. Each M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-0 of the current block. The left column of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-2 of previous block, while the right column of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-4 of next block. The top and the bottom rows and four corners of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data are stored into respective buffers of corresponding blocks based on the geometry of the input image (e.g.,  FIGS. 11A-11C ). \\n     An example second set of memory buffers for storing filter coefficients are shown in  FIG. 13A . In one embodiment, a pair of independent buffers Buffer0  1301  and Buffer1  1302  is provided. The pair of independent buffers allow one of the buffers  1301 - 1302  to receive data from the I/O data bus  1330  while the other one to feed data into a CNN processing block (not shown). Two operational modes are shown herein. \\n     Example storage schemes of filter coefficients are shown in  FIG. 13B . Each of the pair of buffers (i.e., Buffer0  1301  or Buffer1  1302 ) has a width (i.e., word size  1310 ). In one embodiment, the word size is 120-bit. Accordingly, each of the filter coefficients (i.e., C(3\u00d73) and b) occupies 12-bit in the first example storage scheme  1311 . In the second example storage scheme  1312 , each filter coefficient occupies 6-bit thereby 20 coefficients are stored in each word. In the third example scheme  1313 , 3-bit is used for each coefficient hence four sets of filter coefficients (40 coefficients) are stored. Finally, in the fourth example storage scheme  1314 , 80 coefficients are stored in each word, each coefficient occupies 1.5-bit. \\n     In another embodiment, a third memory buffer can be set up for storing entire filter coefficients to avoid I/O delay. In general, the input image must be at certain size such that all filter coefficients can be stored. This can be done by allocating some unused capacity in the first set of memory buffers to accommodate such a third memory buffer. Since all memory buffers are logically defined in RAM (Random-Access Memory), well known techniques may be used for creating the third memory buffer. In other words, the first and the second sets of memory buffers can be adjusted to fit different amounts of imagery data and/or filter coefficients. Furthermore, the total amount of RAM is dependent upon what is required in image processing operations. \\n     When more than one CNN processing engine is configured on the integrated circuit. The CNN processing engine is connected to first and second neighbor CNN processing engines via a clock-skew circuit. For illustration simplicity, only CNN processing block and memory buffers for imagery data are shown. An example clock-skew circuit  1440  for a group of CNN processing engines are shown in  FIG. 14 . The CNN processing engines connected via the second example clock-skew circuit  1440  form a loop. In other words, each CNN processing engine sends its own imagery data to a first neighbor and, at the same time, receives a second neighbor&#39;s imagery data. Clock-skew circuit  1440  can be achieved with well-known manners. For example, each CNN processing engine is connected with a D flip-flop  1442 . \\n     A special case with only two CNN processing engines are connected in a loop, the first neighbor and the second neighbor are the same. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 15 , it is a schematic diagram showing an example image processing technique based on convolutional neural networks in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Based on convolutional neural networks, multi-layer input imagery data  1511   a - 1511   c  is processed with convolutions using a first set of filters or weights  1520 . Since the imagery data  1511   a - 1511   c  is larger than the filters  1520 . Each corresponding overlapped sub-region  1515  of the imagery data is processed. After the convolutional results are obtained, activation may be conducted before a first pooling operation  1530 . In one embodiment, activation is achieved with rectification performed in a rectified linear unit (ReLU). As a result of the first pooling operation  1530 , the imagery data is reduced to a reduced set of imagery data  1531   a - 1531   c . For 2\u00d72 pooling, the reduced set of imagery data is reduced by a factor of 4 from the previous set. \\n     The previous convolution-to-pooling procedure is repeated. The reduced set of imagery data  1531   a - 1531   c  is then processed with convolutions using a second set of filters  1540 . Similarly, each overlapped sub-region  1535  is processed. Another activation may be conducted before a second pooling operation  1540 . The convolution-to-pooling procedures are repeated for several layers and finally connected to at least one Fully-connected (FC) layer  1560 . In image classification, respective probabilities of predefined categories can be computed in FC layers  1560 . \\n     This repeated convolution-to-pooling procedure is trained using a known dataset or database. For image classification, the dataset contains the predefined categories. A particular set of filters, activation and pooling can be tuned and obtained before use for classifying an imagery data, for example, a specific combination of filter types, number of filters, order of filters, pooling types, and/or when to perform activation. In one embodiment, convolutional neural networks are based on Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) architecture neural nets, which contains 13 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers. \\n     A trained convolutional neural networks model is achieved with an example set of operations  1600  shown in  FIG. 16 . At action  1602 , a convolutional neural networks model is first obtained by training the convolutional neural networks model based on image classification of a labeled dataset, which contains a sufficiently large number of input data (e.g., imagery data, converted voice data, optical character reorganization (OCR) data, etc.). For example, there are at least 4,000 data for each category. In other words, each data in the labeled dataset is associated with a category to be classified. The convolutional neural networks model includes multiple ordered filter groups (e.g., each filter group corresponds to a convolutional layer in the convolutional neural networks model). Each filter in the multiple ordered filter groups contains a standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel (i.e., nine coefficients in floating point number format (e.g., standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel  1710  in  FIG. 17 )). Each of the nine coefficients can be any negative or positive real number (i.e., a number with fraction). The initial convolutional neural networks model may be obtained from many different frameworks including, but not limited to, Mxnet, caffe, tensorflow, etc. \\n     Then, at action  1604 , the convolutional neural networks model is modified by converting respective standard 3\u00d73 filter kernels  1710  to corresponding bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels  1720  of a currently-processed filter group in the multiple ordered filter groups based on a set of kernel conversion schemes. In one embodiment, each of the nine coefficients C(i,j) in the corresponding bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernel  1720  is assigned a value \u2018A\u2019 equal to the average of absolute coefficient values multiplied by the sign of corresponding coefficients in the standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel  1710  shown in following formula: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n                   A \\n                   = \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \u2211 \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           1 \\n                           \u2264 \\n                           i \\n                         \\n                         , \\n                         \\n                           j \\n                           \u2264 \\n                           3 \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                         \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         \\uf603 \\n                         \\n                           C \\n                           ( \\n                           \\n                             i \\n                             , \\n                             j \\n                           \\n                           ) \\n                         \\n                         \\uf604 \\n                       \\n                       / \\n                       9 \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n               \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   2 \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     Filter groups are converted one at a time in the order defined in the multiple ordered filter groups. In certain situation, two consecutive filter groups are optionally combined such that the training of the convolutional neural networks model is more efficient. \\n     Next, at action  1606 , the modified convolutional neural networks model is retrained until a desired convergence criterion is met or achieved. There are a number of well known convergence criteria including, but not limited to, completing a predefined number of retraining operation, converging of accuracy loss due to filter kernel conversion, etc. In one embodiment, all filter groups including already converted in previous retraining operations can be changed or altered for fine tuning. In another embodiment, the already converted filter groups are frozen or unaltered during the retraining operation of the currently-processed filter group. \\n     Process  1600  moves to decision  1608 , it is determined whether there is another unconverted filter group. If \u2018yes\u2019, process  1600  moves back to repeat actions  1604 - 1606  until all filter groups have been converted. Decision  1608  becomes \u2018no\u2019 thereafter. At action  1610 , coefficients of bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels in all filter groups are transformed from a floating point number format to a fixed point number format to accommodate the data structure required in the CNN based integrated circuit. Furthermore, the fixed point number is implemented as reconfigurable circuits in the CNN based integrated circuit. In one embodiment, the coefficients are implemented using 12-bit fixed point number format. \\n       FIG. 18  is a diagram showing an example data conversion scheme for converting data from 8-bit [0-255] to 5-bit [0-31] per pixel. For example, bits 0-7 becomes 0, bits 8-15 becomes 1, etc. \\n     In another embodiment, entire set of coefficients can be trained on the CNN based integrated circuit. In other words, the conversion from full floating point number format to fixed point number format is not necessary. The coefficients of bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels are trained directly. Conversion from standard kernel to bi-value filter kernel is not required. \\n     As described in process  1600  of  FIG. 16 , a convolutional neural networks model is trained for the CNN based integrated circuit. The entire set of trained coefficients or weights are pre-configured to the CNN based integrated circuit as a feature extractor for a particular data format (e.g., imagery data, voice spectrum, fingerprint, palm-print, optical character recognition (OCR), etc.). In general, there are many convolutional layers with many filters in each layer. In one embodiment, VGG16 model contains 13 convolutional layers. In a software based image classification task, computations for the convolutional layers take majority of computations (e.g., 90%) traditionally. This computations is drastically reduced with a dedicated hardware such as CNN based IC  100 . \\n     For better extracting features in different domains, like speech, face recognition, gesture recognition and etc, different sets of configured convolution layer coefficients are provided for that domain. And the particular set of convolution layers is used as a general feature extractor for the specific tasks in that domain. For example, the specific task of family members face recognition in the domain of face recognition, and the specific task of company employee face recognition also in the same domain of face recognition. And these two specific tasks can share the same set of convolution layers coefficients used for face detection. \\n       FIGS. 19A-19B  are diagrams showing an example image classification task using a deep learning network (e.g., VGG16) that includes convolutional layers followed by fully-connected (FC) layers. Input data (e.g., imagery data with three basic color channels)  1910  is processed through a number of ordered convolutional layers  1925  in a CNN based integrated circuit (e.g., integrated circuit  100  of  FIG. 1 )  1920 . The output  1930  of the last layer of the ordered convolutional layers contains P channels or feature maps with F\u00d7F pixels of data per feature map. F and P are positive integers or whole numbers. For illustration and description simplicity, activation layers and pooling layers are not shown in the CNN based integrated circuit  1920 . \\n     FC layers shown in  FIG. 19B  starts at the output  1930  of the last layer of the ordered convolutional layers. Each of the F\u00d7F\u00d7P pixels of data (A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A N )  1935  of the output  1930  is fully connected to S nodal feature values  1941  (B 1 , B 2 , . . . , B S ) in the next layer. If there are additional FC layer, each of the S nodal feature values  1941  is fully-connected to T nodal feature values  1942  (C 1 , C 2 , . . . , C T ) of yet next layer. To obtain nodal feature values, respective FC layer weights (W 11 , W 12 , W 13 , . . . , W TS ) are used using the following formula: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       C \\n                       t \\n                     \\n                     = \\n                     \\n                       Bias \\n                       + \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           \u2211 \\n                           \\n                             \\n                               s \\n                               = \\n                               1 \\n                             \\n                             , \\n                             S \\n                           \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                             \\n                         \\n                         \\ue89e \\n                         \\n                           \\n                             W \\n                             ts \\n                           \\n                           \u00d7 \\n                           \\n                             B \\n                             s \\n                           \\n                         \\n                       \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   , \\n                   \\n                     t \\n                     = \\n                     l \\n                   \\n                   , \\n                   T \\n                 \\n               \\n               \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   3 \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     where T and S are positive integers. Bias is not shown in  FIGS. 19A-19B . \\n     The output of the FC layers are X classes  1946  for image classification. In one embodiment, there are 13 ordered convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers in VGG 16 model, in which F=7, P=512, and two 4096 nodal features with  1000  classes. \\n     Because convolutional operations are conducted with very fast speed in the CNN based integrated circuit, FC layers become bottleneck in an image classification task using deep learning model such as VGG16 model.  FIG. 20  is a schematic diagram showing example multiple 3\u00d73 filter kernels for approximating operations of FC layers. In one embodiment, the arrays of 3\u00d73 filter kernels are implemented in the CNN based integrated circuit  1920 . \\n     Instead of inner-product operations, convolutional operations using multiple arrays of 3\u00d73 filter kernels are used. As shown in  FIG. 20 , the output  2030  of the convolutional layers contains P feature maps with F\u00d7F pixels of data per feature map. An array of Q\u00d7P of 3\u00d73 filter kernels  2051  is used for convolutional operations to obtain Q feature maps  2061  with (F\u22122)\u00d7(F\u22122) pixels of useful data per feature map. Useful data are located in center portion of respective feature maps, when one-pixel padding is added around the perimeter of each feature map for convolutional operations. When no padding scheme is used, the size of feature maps shrinks by two pixels in each direction after each of the L layers. The next layer is substantial similar to the previous one. R feature maps  2062  with (F\u22124)\u00d7(F\u22124) pixels of useful data per feature map are obtained using an array of R\u00d7Q of 3\u00d73 filter kernels  2052 . The procedure continues until the final output contains Z feature maps  2069  with 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data per feature map. F, P, Q, R, Z are positive integer. The 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data of the final output can be treated as Z classes for image classification. \\n     It is evident that the number of layers to reduce F\u00d7F pixels of data to 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data requires L layers, where L is equal to (F\u22121)/2, if F is an odd number. If F is an even number, then certain well-known padding techniques need to be applied to the F\u00d7F pixels of data to ensure the final output contains 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data. For example, L is equal to (F\u22122)/2 if no padding to the right and bottom sides of the feature map, or L is equal to F/2 if two-pixel padding to the right and bottom. Any larger number of layers can be achieved with additional redundancy for more robustness. However, it would require additional resources (e.g., processing power, storage, etc.). Any smaller number of layers can be used for computation efficiency. However, it may sacrifice some accuracy. \\n     All of the 3\u00d73 filter kernels are trained in many well known techniques. To implement this technique in a CNN based integrated circuit, special format of the filter kernels must be used (e.g., bi-value filter kernels described and shown in  FIG. 16 ). \\n     Using 512 feature maps with 7\u00d77 pixels of data per feature map as an example, the number of classes is 1000 (i.e., Z=1000), Q and R can be any positive number preferably at least 512. \\n       FIGS. 21A-21B  are diagrams showing example inner-product replacement array of 3\u00d73 convolutional filter kernels in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. To replace inner-product operations between S feature maps with 1\u00d71 pixel of data  2161  (i.e., S feature values  1941 ) and T feature maps with 1\u00d71 pixel of data  2162  (i.e., T feature values  1942 ), an array of T\u00d7S of 3\u00d73 filter kernels  2151  is used. FC layer weights (i.e., W 11 , W 12 , W 13 , . . . , W TS )  2188  are respectively stored in center pixel of T\u00d7S of 3\u00d73 filter kernels. Numerical value of zeros are stored in eight perimeter pixels of all the 3\u00d73 filter kernels. At the end, Y classes with 1\u00d71 pixel of data per class  2169  is the output. S, T and Y are positive integers. \\n     In one embodiment, the Steel Surface Failure Analysis data set is used to verify accuracy of using approximated FC layers in a CNN based integrated circuit. \\n     Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof, these embodiments are merely illustrative, and not restrictive of, the invention. Various modifications or changes to the specifically disclosed example embodiments will be suggested to persons skilled in the art. For example, whereas the input image has been shown and described as partitioning into M-pixel by M-pixel blocks in certain order, other orders may be used in the invention to achieve the same, for example, the ordering of the M-pixel by M-pixel blocks may be column-wise instead of row-wise. Furthermore, whereas M-pixel by M-pixel blocks have been shown and described using M equals to 14 as an example. M can be chosen as other positive integers to accomplish the same, for example, 16, 20, 30, etc. Additionally, activation layers (e.g., ReLU layers) and pooling layers have been omitted in  FIGS. 19A-19B, 20, 21A-21B  and associated descriptions because such layers can be equivalently conducted in the invention. Finally, whereas multiple 3\u00d73 filter kernels for approximating operations of FC layers have been described and shown in a CNN based integrated circuit, such approximation can be performed in any other comparable computing device (e.g., CPU or GPU). In summary, the scope of the invention should not be restricted to the specific example embodiments disclosed herein, and all modifications that are readily suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art should be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

However, most of the prior art CNN approaches are either based on software solutions (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc.) or based on hardware that are designed for other purposes (e.g., graphic processing, general computation, etc.). As a result, CNN prior approaches are too slow in term of computational speed and/or too expensive thereby impractical for processing large amount of imagery data. The imagery data can be from any two-dimensional data (e.g., still photo, picture, a frame of a video stream, converted form of voice data, etc.).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Traditional deep learning network architecture for classifying two-dimensional input imagery data generally contains two parts: ordered convolutional layers followed by fully-connected (FC) layers. Notably, ordered convolutional layers require less storage for holding filter coefficients but require significantly larger amounts of computation for \u2018multiplication-add\u2019s (Mult-Adds) (e.g., VGG16 requires 15 TFLOPs) due to the repeated applications of convolutional filter kernels. On the contrary, FC layers require less computations for Mult-Adds but necessitate a significant amount of storage (e.g., VGG16 requires storage for about 123 millions of FC layer weights/coefficients) for storing coefficients due to inner-products (i.e., respective multiplications between FC layer weights and nodal feature values obtained in the previous level). With operations of ordered convolutional layers performed in a CNN based integrated circuit, the computation bottleneck in deep learning networks is in FC layers. Since FC layers require large amount of storage, prior art approaches have been using computational devices outside of the CNN based integrated circuit, for example CPU (central processing unit) or GPU (graphics processing unit).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">It would therefore be desirable to have systems and methods of performing image classification task within in a CNN based integrated circuit entirely.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">This section is for the purpose of summarizing some aspects of the invention and to briefly introduce some preferred embodiments.

However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">Referring first to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1A</figref>, it is shown a block diagram illustrating an example digital integrated circuit (IC) <b>100</b> for extracting features out of an input image in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">The integrated circuit <b>100</b> is implemented as a digital semi-conductor chip and contains a CNN processing engine controller <b>110</b>, and one or more neural networks (CNN) processing engines <b>102</b> operatively coupled to at least one input/output (I/O) data bus <b>120</b>. Controller <b>110</b> is configured to control various operations of the CNN processing engines <b>102</b> for extracting features out of an input image based on an image processing technique by performing multiple layers of 3\u00d73 convolutions with rectifications or other nonlinear operations (e.g., sigmoid function), and 2\u00d72 pooling operations. To perform 3\u00d73 convolutions requires imagery data in digital form and corresponding filter coefficients, which are supplied to the CNN processing engine <b>102</b> via input/output data bus <b>120</b>. It is well known that digital semi-conductor chip contains logic gates, multiplexers, register files, memories, state machines, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">According to one embodiment, the digital integrated circuit <b>100</b> is extendable and scalable. For example, multiple copy of the digital integrated circuit <b>100</b> can be implemented on one semiconductor chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">All of the CNN processing engines are identical. For illustrating simplicity, only few (i.e., CNN processing engines <b>122</b> <i>a</i>-<b>122</b> <i>h</i>, <b>132</b> <i>a</i>-<b>132</b> <i>h</i>) are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1B</figref>. The invention sets no limit to the number of CNN processing engines on a digital semi-conductor chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Each CNN processing engine <b>122</b> <i>a</i>-<b>122</b> <i>h</i>, <b>132</b> <i>a</i>-<b>132</b> <i>h </i>contains a CNN processing block <b>124</b>, a first set of memory buffers <b>126</b> and a second set of memory buffers <b>128</b>. The first set of memory buffers <b>126</b> is configured for receiving imagery data and for supplying the already received imagery data to the CNN processing block <b>124</b>. The second set of memory buffers <b>128</b> is configured for storing filter coefficients and for supplying the already received filter coefficients to the CNN processing block <b>124</b>. In general, the number of CNN processing engines on a chip is 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is an integer (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ). As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1B</figref>, CNN processing engines <b>122</b> <i>a</i>-<b>122</b> <i>h </i>are operatively coupled to a first input/output data bus <b>130</b> <i>a </i>while CNN processing engines <b>132</b> <i>a</i>-<b>132</b> <i>h </i>are operatively coupled to a second input/output data bus <b>130</b> <i>b</i>. Each input/output data bus <b>130</b> <i>a</i>-<b>130</b> <i>b </i>is configured for independently transmitting data (i.e., imagery data and filter coefficients). In one embodiment, the first and the second sets of memory buffers comprise random access memory (RAM). Each of the first and the second sets are logically defined. In other words, respective sizes of the first and the second sets can be reconfigured to accommodate respective amounts of imagery data and filter coefficients.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">The first and the second I/O data bus <b>130</b> <i>a</i>-<b>130</b> <i>b </i>are shown here to connect the CNN processing engines <b>122</b> <i>a</i>-<b>122</b> <i>h</i>, <b>132</b> <i>a</i>-<b>132</b> <i>h </i>in a sequential scheme. In another embodiment, the at least one I/O data bus may have different connection scheme to the CNN processing engines to accomplish the same purpose of parallel data input and output for improving performance.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing an example controller <b>200</b> for controlling various operations of at least one CNN processing engine configured on the integrated circuit. Controller <b>200</b> comprises circuitry to control imagery data loading control <b>212</b>, filter coefficients loading control <b>214</b>, imagery data output control <b>216</b>, and image processing operations control <b>218</b>. Controller <b>200</b> further includes register files <b>220</b> for storing the specific configuration (e.g., number of CNN processing engines, number of input/output data bus, etc.) in the integrated circuit.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Image data loading control <b>212</b> controls loading of imagery data to respective CNN processing engines via the corresponding I/O data bus. Filter coefficients loading control <b>214</b> controls loading of filter coefficients to respective CNN processing engines via corresponding I/O data bus. Imagery data output control <b>216</b> controls output of the imagery data from respective CNN processing engines via corresponding I/O data bus. Image processing operations control <b>218</b> controls various operations such as convolutions, rectifications and pooling operations which can be defined by user of the integrated circuit via a set of user defined directives (e.g., file contains a series of operations such as convolution, rectification, pooling, etc.).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">More details of a CNN processing engine <b>302</b> are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. A CNN processing block <b>304</b> contains digital circuitry that simultaneously obtains M\u00d7M convolutional operations results by performing 3\u00d73 convolutions at M\u00d7M pixel locations using imagery data of a (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region and corresponding filter coefficients from the respective memory buffers. The (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region is formed with the M\u00d7M pixel locations as an M-pixel by M-pixel central portion plus a one-pixel border surrounding the central portion. M is a positive integer. In one embodiment, M equals to 14 and therefore, (M+2) equals to 16, M\u00d7M equals to 14\u00d714=196, and M/2 equals 7.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing a diagram representing (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region <b>410</b> with a central portion of M\u00d7M pixel locations <b>420</b> used in the CNN processing engine <b>302</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">Imagery data may represent characteristics of a pixel in the input image (e.g., one of the color (e.g., RGB (red, green, blue)) values of the pixel, or distance between pixel and observing location). Generally, the value of the RGB is an integer between 0 and 255. Values of filter coefficients are floating point integer numbers that can be either positive or negative.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">In order to achieve faster computations, few computational performance improvement techniques have been used and implemented in the CNN processing block <b>304</b>. In one embodiment, representation of imagery data uses as few bits as practical (e.g., 5-bit representation). In another embodiment, each filter coefficient is represented as an integer with a radix point. Similarly, the integer representing the filter coefficient uses as few bits as practical (e.g., 12-bit representation). As a result, 3\u00d73 convolutions can then be performed using fixed-point arithmetic for faster computations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">Each 3\u00d73 convolution produces one convolutional operations result, Out(m, n), based on the following formula:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <maths id=\"MATH-US-00001\" num=\"00001\">\\n        <math overflow=\"scroll\">\\n          <mtable>\\n            <mtr>\\n              <mtd>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mrow>\\n                    <mi>Out</mi>\\n                    <mo>\\ue8a0</mo>\\n                    <mrow>\\n                      <mo>(</mo>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mi>m</mi>\\n                        <mo>,</mo>\\n                        <mi>n</mi>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                      <mo>)</mo>\\n                    </mrow>\\n                  </mrow>\\n                  <mo>=</mo>\\n                  <mrow>\\n                    <mrow>\\n                      <munder>\\n                        <mo>\u2211</mo>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mn>1</mn>\\n                            <mo>\u2264</mo>\\n                            <mi>i</mi>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                          <mo>,</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mi>j</mi>\\n                            <mo>\u2264</mo>\\n                            <mn>3</mn>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                      </munder>\\n                      <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                      <mstyle>\\n                        <mspace width=\"0.3em\" height=\"0.3ex\"> </mspace>\\n                      </mstyle>\\n                      <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mi>In</mi>\\n                          <mo>\\ue8a0</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mo>(</mo>\\n                            <mrow>\\n                              <mi>m</mi>\\n                              <mo>,</mo>\\n                              <mi>n</mi>\\n                              <mo>,</mo>\\n                              <mi>i</mi>\\n                              <mo>,</mo>\\n                              <mi>j</mi>\\n                            </mrow>\\n                            <mo>)</mo>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                        <mo>\u00d7</mo>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mi>C</mi>\\n                          <mo>\\ue8a0</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mo>(</mo>\\n                            <mrow>\\n                              <mi>i</mi>\\n                              <mo>,</mo>\\n                              <mi>j</mi>\\n                            </mrow>\\n                            <mo>)</mo>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                    </mrow>\\n                    <mo>-</mo>\\n                    <mi>b</mi>\\n                  </mrow>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mtd>\\n              <mtd>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mo>(</mo>\\n                  <mn>1</mn>\\n                  <mo>)</mo>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mtd>\\n            </mtr>\\n          </mtable>\\n        </math>\\n      </maths>\\n    </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0000\">where:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0001-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0002-0001\" num=\"0050\">m, n are corresponding row and column numbers for identifying which imagery data (pixel) within the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region the convolution is performed;</li> <li id=\"ul0002-0002\" num=\"0051\">In(m,n,i,j) is a 3-pixel by 3-pixel area centered at pixel location (m, n) within the region;</li> <li id=\"ul0002-0003\" num=\"0052\">C(i, j) represents one of the nine weight coefficients C(3\u00d73), each corresponds to one of the 3-pixel by 3-pixel area;</li> <li id=\"ul0002-0004\" num=\"0053\">b represents an offset coefficient; and</li> <li id=\"ul0002-0005\" num=\"0054\">j are indices of weight coefficients C(i, j).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0055\">Each CNN processing block <b>304</b> produces M\u00d7M convolutional operations results simultaneously and, all CNN processing engines perform simultaneous operations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0056\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> show three different examples of the M\u00d7M pixel locations.

Both imagery data and filter coefficients are fed to the CNN block <b>304</b> at each clock of the digital integrated circuit. Filter coefficients (i.e., C(3\u00d73) and b) are fed into the CNN processing block <b>304</b> directly from the second set of memory buffers <b>308</b>.

Clock-skew circuit <b>320</b> can be achieved with known techniques (e.g., a D flip-flop <b>322</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0062\">The first neighbor CNN processing engine may be referred to as an upstream neighbor CNN processing engine in the loop formed by the clock-skew circuit <b>320</b>.

An example clock cycle <b>310</b> is drawn for demonstrating the time relationship between pulse <b>311</b> and pulse <b>312</b>. As shown pulse <b>311</b> is one clock before pulse <b>312</b>, results of the 3\u00d73 convolutional operations are stored into the first set of memory buffers after a particular block of imagery data has been processed by all CNN processing engines through the clock-skew circuit <b>320</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0064\">After the convolutional operations result Out(m, n) is obtained from Formula (1), rectification procedure may be performed as directed by image processing control <b>218</b>.

In order to store the (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) output results in corresponding locations in the first set of memory buffers, additional bookkeeping techniques are required to track proper memory addresses such that four (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) output results can be processed in one CNN processing engine.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0066\">To demonstrate a 2\u00d72 pooling operation, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9A</figref> is a diagram graphically showing first example output results of a 2-pixel by 2-pixel block being reduced to a single value 10.5, which is the largest value of the four output results. The technique shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9A</figref> is referred to as \u201cmax pooling\u201d. When the average value 4.6 of the four output results is used for the single value shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9B</figref>, it is referred to as \u201caverage pooling\u201d. There are other pooling operations, for example, \u201cmixed max average pooling\u201d which is a combination of \u201cmax pooling\u201d and \u201caverage pooling\u201d. The main goal of the pooling operation is to reduce size of the imagery data being processed. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram illustrating M\u00d7M pixel locations, through a 2\u00d72 pooling operation, are reduced to (M/2)\u00d7(M/2) locations, which is one fourth of the original size.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0067\">An input image generally contains a large amount of imagery data. In order to perform image processing operations. The input image <b>1100</b> is partitioned into M-pixel by M-pixel blocks <b>1111</b>-<b>1112</b> as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11A</figref>. Imagery data associated with each of these M-pixel by M-pixel blocks is then fed into respective CNN processing engines. At each of the M\u00d7M pixel locations in a particular M-pixel by M-pixel block, 3\u00d73 convolutions are simultaneously performed in the corresponding CNN processing block.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0068\">Although the invention does not require specific characteristic dimension of an input image, the input image may be required to resize to fit to a predefined characteristic dimension for certain image processing procedures. In an embodiment, a square shape with (2<sup>K</sup>\u00d7M)-pixel by (2<sup>K</sup>\u00d7M)-pixel is required. K is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). When M equals 14 and K equals 4, the characteristic dimension is 224. In another embodiment, the input image is a rectangular shape with dimensions of (2<sup>I</sup>xM)-pixel and (2<sup>1</sup>\u00d7M)-pixel, where I and J are positive integers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0069\">In order to properly perform 3\u00d73 convolutions at pixel locations around the border of a M-pixel by M-pixel block, additional imagery data from neighboring blocks are required. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11B</figref> shows a typical M-pixel by M-pixel block <b>1120</b> (bordered with dotted lines) within a (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region <b>1130</b>. The (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region is formed by a central portion of M-pixel by M-pixel from the current block, and four edges (i.e., top, right, bottom and left) and four corners (i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left) from corresponding neighboring blocks. Additional details are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref> and corresponding descriptions for the first set of memory buffers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0070\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11C</figref> shows two example M-pixel by M-pixel blocks <b>1122</b>-<b>1124</b> and respective associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel regions <b>1132</b>-<b>1134</b>. These two example blocks <b>1122</b>-<b>1124</b> are located along the perimeter of the input image. The first example M-pixel by M-pixel block <b>1122</b> is located at top-left corner, therefore, the first example block <b>1122</b> has neighbors for two edges and one corner. Value \u201c0\u201ds are used for the two edges and three corners without neighbors (shown as shaded area) in the associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region <b>1132</b> for forming imagery data. Similarly, the associated (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region <b>1134</b> of the second example block <b>1124</b> requires \u201c0\u201ds be used for the top edge and two top corners. Other blocks along the perimeter of the input image are treated similarly. In other words, for the purpose to perform 3\u00d73 convolutions at each pixel of the input image, a layer of zeros (\u201c0\u201d s) is added outside of the perimeter of the input image. This can be achieved with many well-known techniques. For example, default values of the first set of memory buffers are set to zero. If no imagery data is filled in from the neighboring blocks, those edges and corners would contain zeros.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0071\">Furthermore, an input image can contain a large amount of imagery data, which may not be able to be fed into the CNN processing engines in its entirety. Therefore, the first set of memory buffers is configured on the respective CNN processing engines for storing a portion of the imagery data of the input image. The first set of memory buffers contains nine different data buffers graphically illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>. Nine buffers are designed to match the (M+2)-pixel by (M+2)-pixel region as follows:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0000\">1) buffer-0 for storing M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the central portion;\\n<br/>\\n2) buffer-1 for storing 1\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the top edge;\\n<br/>\\n3) buffer-2 for storing M\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the right edge;\\n<br/>\\n4) buffer-3 for storing 1\u00d7M pixels of imagery data representing the bottom edge;\\n<br/>\\n5) buffer-4 for storing M\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the left edge;\\n<br/>\\n6) buffer-5 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the top left corner;\\n<br/>\\n7) buffer-6 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the top right corner;\\n<br/>\\n8) buffer-7 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the bottom right corner;\\n<br/>\\nand\\n<br/>\\n9) buffer-8 for storing 1\u00d71 pixels of imagery data representing the bottom left corner.\\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0072\">Imagery data received from the I/O data bus are in form of M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data in consecutive blocks. Each M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-0 of the current block. The left column of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-2 of previous block, while the right column of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data is stored into buffer-4 of next block. The top and the bottom rows and four corners of the received M\u00d7M pixels of imagery data are stored into respective buffers of corresponding blocks based on the geometry of the input image (e.g., <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11A-11C</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0073\">An example second set of memory buffers for storing filter coefficients are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>. In one embodiment, a pair of independent buffers Buffer0 <b>1301</b> and Buffer1 <b>1302</b> is provided. The pair of independent buffers allow one of the buffers <b>1301</b>-<b>1302</b> to receive data from the I/O data bus <b>1330</b> while the other one to feed data into a CNN processing block (not shown). Two operational modes are shown herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0074\">Example storage schemes of filter coefficients are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>. Each of the pair of buffers (i.e., Buffer0 <b>1301</b> or Buffer1 <b>1302</b>) has a width (i.e., word size <b>1310</b>). In one embodiment, the word size is 120-bit. Accordingly, each of the filter coefficients (i.e., C(3\u00d73) and b) occupies 12-bit in the first example storage scheme <b>1311</b>. In the second example storage scheme <b>1312</b>, each filter coefficient occupies 6-bit thereby 20 coefficients are stored in each word. In the third example scheme <b>1313</b>, 3-bit is used for each coefficient hence four sets of filter coefficients (40 coefficients) are stored. Finally, in the fourth example storage scheme <b>1314</b>, 80 coefficients are stored in each word, each coefficient occupies 1.5-bit.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0075\">In another embodiment, a third memory buffer can be set up for storing entire filter coefficients to avoid I/O delay. In general, the input image must be at certain size such that all filter coefficients can be stored. This can be done by allocating some unused capacity in the first set of memory buffers to accommodate such a third memory buffer. Since all memory buffers are logically defined in RAM (Random-Access Memory), well known techniques may be used for creating the third memory buffer. In other words, the first and the second sets of memory buffers can be adjusted to fit different amounts of imagery data and/or filter coefficients. Furthermore, the total amount of RAM is dependent upon what is required in image processing operations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0076\">When more than one CNN processing engine is configured on the integrated circuit. The CNN processing engine is connected to first and second neighbor CNN processing engines via a clock-skew circuit. For illustration simplicity, only CNN processing block and memory buffers for imagery data are shown. An example clock-skew circuit <b>1440</b> for a group of CNN processing engines are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>. The CNN processing engines connected via the second example clock-skew circuit <b>1440</b> form a loop. In other words, each CNN processing engine sends its own imagery data to a first neighbor and, at the same time, receives a second neighbor&#39;s imagery data. Clock-skew circuit <b>1440</b> can be achieved with well-known manners. For example, each CNN processing engine is connected with a D flip-flop <b>1442</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0077\">A special case with only two CNN processing engines are connected in a loop, the first neighbor and the second neighbor are the same.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0078\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref>, it is a schematic diagram showing an example image processing technique based on convolutional neural networks in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Based on convolutional neural networks, multi-layer input imagery data <b>1511</b> <i>a</i>-<b>1511</b> <i>c </i>is processed with convolutions using a first set of filters or weights <b>1520</b>. Since the imagery data <b>1511</b> <i>a</i>-<b>1511</b> <i>c </i>is larger than the filters <b>1520</b>. Each corresponding overlapped sub-region <b>1515</b> of the imagery data is processed. After the convolutional results are obtained, activation may be conducted before a first pooling operation <b>1530</b>. In one embodiment, activation is achieved with rectification performed in a rectified linear unit (ReLU). As a result of the first pooling operation <b>1530</b>, the imagery data is reduced to a reduced set of imagery data <b>1531</b> <i>a</i>-<b>1531</b> <i>c</i>. For 2\u00d72 pooling, the reduced set of imagery data is reduced by a factor of 4 from the previous set.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0079\">The previous convolution-to-pooling procedure is repeated. The reduced set of imagery data <b>1531</b> <i>a</i>-<b>1531</b> <i>c </i>is then processed with convolutions using a second set of filters <b>1540</b>. Similarly, each overlapped sub-region <b>1535</b> is processed. Another activation may be conducted before a second pooling operation <b>1540</b>. The convolution-to-pooling procedures are repeated for several layers and finally connected to at least one Fully-connected (FC) layer <b>1560</b>. In image classification, respective probabilities of predefined categories can be computed in FC layers <b>1560</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0080\">This repeated convolution-to-pooling procedure is trained using a known dataset or database. For image classification, the dataset contains the predefined categories. A particular set of filters, activation and pooling can be tuned and obtained before use for classifying an imagery data, for example, a specific combination of filter types, number of filters, order of filters, pooling types, and/or when to perform activation. In one embodiment, convolutional neural networks are based on Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) architecture neural nets, which contains 13 convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0081\">A trained convolutional neural networks model is achieved with an example set of operations <b>1600</b> shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. At action <b>1602</b>, a convolutional neural networks model is first obtained by training the convolutional neural networks model based on image classification of a labeled dataset, which contains a sufficiently large number of input data (e.g., imagery data, converted voice data, optical character reorganization (OCR) data, etc.). For example, there are at least 4,000 data for each category. In other words, each data in the labeled dataset is associated with a category to be classified. The convolutional neural networks model includes multiple ordered filter groups (e.g., each filter group corresponds to a convolutional layer in the convolutional neural networks model). Each filter in the multiple ordered filter groups contains a standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel (i.e., nine coefficients in floating point number format (e.g., standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel <b>1710</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>)). Each of the nine coefficients can be any negative or positive real number (i.e., a number with fraction). The initial convolutional neural networks model may be obtained from many different frameworks including, but not limited to, Mxnet, caffe, tensorflow, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0082\">Then, at action <b>1604</b>, the convolutional neural networks model is modified by converting respective standard 3\u00d73 filter kernels <b>1710</b> to corresponding bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels <b>1720</b> of a currently-processed filter group in the multiple ordered filter groups based on a set of kernel conversion schemes. In one embodiment, each of the nine coefficients C(i,j) in the corresponding bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernel <b>1720</b> is assigned a value \u2018A\u2019 equal to the average of absolute coefficient values multiplied by the sign of corresponding coefficients in the standard 3\u00d73 filter kernel <b>1710</b> shown in following formula:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <maths id=\"MATH-US-00002\" num=\"00002\">\\n        <math overflow=\"scroll\">\\n          <mtable>\\n            <mtr>\\n              <mtd>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mi>A</mi>\\n                  <mo>=</mo>\\n                  <mrow>\\n                    <munder>\\n                      <mo>\u2211</mo>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mn>1</mn>\\n                          <mo>\u2264</mo>\\n                          <mi>i</mi>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                        <mo>,</mo>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mi>j</mi>\\n                          <mo>\u2264</mo>\\n                          <mn>3</mn>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                    </munder>\\n                    <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                    <mstyle>\\n                      <mspace width=\"0.3em\" height=\"0.3ex\"> </mspace>\\n                    </mstyle>\\n                    <mo>\\ue89e</mo>\\n                    <mrow>\\n                      <mrow>\\n                        <mo>\\uf603</mo>\\n                        <mrow>\\n                          <mi>C</mi>\\n                          <mo>(</mo>\\n                          <mrow>\\n                            <mi>i</mi>\\n                            <mo>,</mo>\\n                            <mi>j</mi>\\n                          </mrow>\\n                          <mo>)</mo>\\n                        </mrow>\\n                        <mo>\\uf604</mo>\\n                      </mrow>\\n                      <mo>/</mo>\\n                      <mn>9</mn>\\n                    </mrow>\\n                  </mrow>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mtd>\\n              <mtd>\\n                <mrow>\\n                  <mo>(</mo>\\n                  <mn>2</mn>\\n                  <mo>)</mo>\\n                </mrow>\\n              </mtd>\\n            </mtr>\\n          </mtable>\\n        </math>\\n      </maths>\\n    </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0083\">Filter groups are converted one at a time in the order defined in the multiple ordered filter groups.

There are a number of well known convergence criteria including, but not limited to, completing a predefined number of retraining operation, converging of accuracy loss due to filter kernel conversion, etc. In one embodiment, all filter groups including already converted in previous retraining operations can be changed or altered for fine tuning. In another embodiment, the already converted filter groups are frozen or unaltered during the retraining operation of the currently-processed filter group.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0085\">Process <b>1600</b> moves to decision <b>1608</b>, it is determined whether there is another unconverted filter group.

At action <b>1610</b>, coefficients of bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels in all filter groups are transformed from a floating point number format to a fixed point number format to accommodate the data structure required in the CNN based integrated circuit. Furthermore, the fixed point number is implemented as reconfigurable circuits in the CNN based integrated circuit. In one embodiment, the coefficients are implemented using 12-bit fixed point number format.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0086\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram showing an example data conversion scheme for converting data from 8-bit [0-255] to 5-bit [0-31] per pixel. For example, bits 0-7 becomes 0, bits 8-15 becomes 1, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0087\">In another embodiment, entire set of coefficients can be trained on the CNN based integrated circuit. In other words, the conversion from full floating point number format to fixed point number format is not necessary. The coefficients of bi-valued 3\u00d73 filter kernels are trained directly. Conversion from standard kernel to bi-value filter kernel is not required.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0088\">As described in process <b>1600</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>, a convolutional neural networks model is trained for the CNN based integrated circuit. The entire set of trained coefficients or weights are pre-configured to the CNN based integrated circuit as a feature extractor for a particular data format (e.g., imagery data, voice spectrum, fingerprint, palm-print, optical character recognition (OCR), etc.). In general, there are many convolutional layers with many filters in each layer. In one embodiment, VGG16 model contains 13 convolutional layers. In a software based image classification task, computations for the convolutional layers take majority of computations (e.g., 90%) traditionally. This computations is drastically reduced with a dedicated hardware such as CNN based IC <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0089\">For better extracting features in different domains, like speech, face recognition, gesture recognition and etc, different sets of configured convolution layer coefficients are provided for that domain. And the particular set of convolution layers is used as a general feature extractor for the specific tasks in that domain. For example, the specific task of family members face recognition in the domain of face recognition, and the specific task of company employee face recognition also in the same domain of face recognition. And these two specific tasks can share the same set of convolution layers coefficients used for face detection.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0090\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19A-19B</figref> are diagrams showing an example image classification task using a deep learning network (e.g., VGG16) that includes convolutional layers followed by fully-connected (FC) layers.

An array of Q\u00d7P of 3\u00d73 filter kernels <b>2051</b> is used for convolutional operations to obtain Q feature maps <b>2061</b> with (F\u22122)\u00d7(F\u22122) pixels of useful data per feature map. Useful data are located in center portion of respective feature maps, when one-pixel padding is added around the perimeter of each feature map for convolutional operations. When no padding scheme is used, the size of feature maps shrinks by two pixels in each direction after each of the L layers. The next layer is substantial similar to the previous one. R feature maps <b>2062</b> with (F\u22124)\u00d7(F\u22124) pixels of useful data per feature map are obtained using an array of R\u00d7Q of 3\u00d73 filter kernels <b>2052</b>.

The 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data of the final output can be treated as Z classes for image classification.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0095\">It is evident that the number of layers to reduce F\u00d7F pixels of data to 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data requires L layers, where L is equal to (F\u22121)/2, if F is an odd number. If F is an even number, then certain well-known padding techniques need to be applied to the F\u00d7F pixels of data to ensure the final output contains 1\u00d71 pixel of useful data. For example, L is equal to (F\u22122)/2 if no padding to the right and bottom sides of the feature map, or L is equal to F/2 if two-pixel padding to the right and bottom. Any larger number of layers can be achieved with additional redundancy for more robustness. However, it would require additional resources (e.g., processing power, storage, etc.).

For example, whereas the input image has been shown and described as partitioning into M-pixel by M-pixel blocks in certain order, other orders may be used in the invention to achieve the same, for example, the ordering of the M-pixel by M-pixel blocks may be column-wise instead of row-wise. Furthermore, whereas M-pixel by M-pixel blocks have been shown and described using M equals to 14 as an example. M can be chosen as other positive integers to accomplish the same, for example, 16, 20, 30, etc. Additionally, activation layers (e.g., ReLU layers) and pooling layers have been omitted in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 19A-19B, 20, 21A-21B</figref> and associated descriptions because such layers can be equivalently conducted in the invention. Finally, whereas multiple 3\u00d73 filter kernels for approximating operations of FC layers have been described and shown in a CNN based integrated circuit, such approximation can be performed in any other comparable computing device (e.g., CPU or GPU). In summary, the scope of the invention should not be restricted to the specific example embodiments disclosed herein, and all modifications that are readily suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art should be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.</p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

More specifically, some applications of the present invention relate to prosthetic valves for replacement of a cardiac valve. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     Ischemic heart disease causes regurgitation of a heart valve by the combination of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles, and the dilatation of the ventricle that is present in ischemic heart disease, with the subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the valve annulus. \\n     Dilation of the annulus of the valve prevents the valve leaflets from fully coapting when the valve is closed. Regurgitation of blood from the ventricle into the atrium results in increased total stroke volume and decreased cardiac output, and ultimate weakening of the ventricle secondary to a volume overload and a pressure overload of the atrium. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     For some applications, an implant is provided having a valve body that defines a lumen, an upstream support portion, and a plurality of legs. The implant is percutaneously deliverable to a native heart valve in a compressed state, and is expandable at the native valve. The implant comprises an inner frame and an outer frame. Typically, the upstream support portion is at least partly defined by the inner frame, and the legs are at least partly defined by the outer frame. The implant is secured at the native valve by sandwiching tissue of the native valve between the upstream support portion and the legs. For some applications, a flexible pouch extends radially outward from the valve body. For some such applications, the arms and the legs narrow the pouch therebetween to form a narrowed portion of the pouch, thereby dividing an interior space of the pouch into (a) an inner portion, radially inward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the lumen, and (b) an outer portion, radially outward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the inner portion via the narrowed portion. \\n     There is therefore provided, in accordance with an application of the present invention, apparatus, including: \\n     a frame assembly that includes:\\n         a valve body that circumscribes a longitudinal axis and defines a lumen along the axis;   a plurality of upstream arms that are coupled to the valve body at a first axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis, each of the arms extending radially outward from the valve body to a respective arm-tip; and   a plurality of downstream legs that are coupled to the valve body at a second axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis, and that extend radially outward from the valve body and toward the plurality of arms;       \\n\\n     a plurality of prosthetic leaflets, disposed within the lumen, and arranged to facilitate one-way upstream-to-downstream fluid flow through the lumen, the first axial level being upstream of the second axial level; and \\n     a flexible pouch that defines an interior space therein, the pouch shaped and coupled to the frame assembly such that:\\n         the pouch extends radially outward from the valve body, and   the arms and the legs narrow the pouch therebetween to form a narrowed portion of the pouch, so as to define:\\n           an inner portion of the interior space, radially inward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the lumen, and   an outer portion of the interior space, radially outward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the inner portion via the narrowed portion.   \\n               \\n\\n     In an application, at the narrowed portion, the legs extend in an upstream direction past the arms. \\n     In an application, the arms are disposed inside the pouch. \\n     In an application, the arms and the legs are arranged such that, at the narrowed portion, the arms and the legs alternate circumferentially. \\n     In an application, the inner portion of the interior space is in fluid communication with the lumen via a plurality of discrete windows defined by the apparatus. \\n     In an application, the apparatus further includes a belt wrapped around the frame assembly downstream of the windows, circumscribing the lumen, each of the windows being bounded, at a downstream edge of the window, by the belt. \\n     In an application, the leaflets are arranged to form a plurality of commissures therebetween, and are attached to the frame assembly at the commissures, and the belt is disposed over the commissures. \\n     In an application: \\n     the pouch has an upstream surface and a downstream surface, and, \\n     at the narrowed portion, each of the legs pushes the downstream surface toward the upstream surface. \\n     In an application, at the narrowed portion, each of the legs pushes the downstream surface into contact with the upstream surface. \\n     In an application, at the narrowed portion, each of the legs forms a respective bulge in the upstream surface by pressing the downstream surface against the upstream surface. \\n     In an application, the pouch is stitched to the arms. \\n     In an application, at the narrowed portion, the pouch is stitched to the arms but not to the legs. \\n     In an application, the frame assembly includes (i) a valve frame that defines the valve body and the plurality of upstream arms, and (ii) an outer frame that circumscribes the valve frame, and defines the plurality of downstream legs. \\n     In an application, an upstream portion of the pouch is attached to the valve frame, and a downstream portion of the pouch is attached to the outer frame. \\n     In an application, the apparatus further includes at least one coagulation component, disposed within the outer portion of the interior space, and configured to promote blood coagulation within the outer portion of the interior space. \\n     In an application, the coagulation component is annular, and, within the outer portion of the interior space, circumscribes the longitudinal axis. \\n     There is further provided, in accordance with an application of the present invention, apparatus, including: \\n     a frame assembly that includes:\\n         a valve body that circumscribes a longitudinal axis and defines a lumen along the axis;

and \\n         FIGS. 20, and 21A -C are schematic illustrations of an implant, in accordance with some applications of the invention. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 1A-E  and  2 , which are schematic illustrations of an implant  20  and a frame assembly  22  of the implant, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Implant  20  serves as a prosthetic valve for use at a native heart valve of a subject\u2014typically the mitral valve. Implant  20  has a compressed state for minimally-invasive (typically transluminal, e.g., transfemoral) delivery, and an expanded state into which the implant is transitioned at the native heart valve, and in which the implant provides prosthetic valve functionality. Implant  20  comprises frame assembly  22 , flexible sheeting  23 , and a valve member such as prosthetic leaflets  58 . \\n       FIGS. 1A-E  show implant  20  and frame assembly  22  in the expanded state. For clarity,  FIGS. 1A-D  show frame assembly  22  alone.  FIG. 1A  shows an isometric exploded view of frame assembly  22 , and  FIG. 1B  shows a side exploded view of the frame assembly.  FIGS. 1C and 1D  are side- and top-views, respectively, of frame assembly  22 , assembled.  FIG. 1E  is a perspective view of implant  20 , including sheeting  23  and leaflets  58 . \\n     Implant  20  has an upstream end  24 , a downstream end  26 , and defines a central longitudinal axis ax 1  therebetween. Frame assembly  22  comprises a valve frame  30  that comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion)  32  that has an upstream end  34  and a downstream end  36 , and is shaped to define a lumen  38  through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve body  32  circumscribes axis ax 1 , and thereby defines lumen  38  along the axis. Throughout this application, including the specification and the claims, unless stated otherwise, \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream,\u201d e.g., with respect to the ends of implant  20 , are defined with respect to the longitudinal axis of implant  20 , by the orientation and functioning of leaflets  58 , which facilitate one-way upstream-to-downstream fluid flow through lumen  38 . \\n     Valve frame  30  further comprises a plurality of arms  46 , each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body  32 . In this context, the term \u201cextends radially outward\u201d is not limited to extending in a straight line that is orthogonal to axis ax 1 , but rather, and as shown for arms  46 , includes extending away from axis ax 1  while curving in an upstream and/or downstream direction. Typically, and as shown, each arm  46  extends from valve body  32  in an upstream direction, and curves radially outward. That is, the portion of arm  46  closest to valve body  32  extends primarily upstream away from the valve body (e.g., extending radially outward only a little, extending not at all radially outward, or even extending radially inward a little), and the arm then curves to extend radially outward. The curvature of arms  46  is described in more detail hereinbelow. \\n     Valve body  32  is defined by a repeating pattern of cells that extends around central longitudinal axis ax 1 . In the expanded state of each tubular portion, these cells are typically narrower at their upstream and downstream extremities than midway between these extremities. For example, and as shown, the cells may be roughly diamond or astroid in shape. Typically, and as shown, valve body  32  is defined by two stacked, tessellated rows of cells\u2014an upstream row  29   a  of first-row cells, and a downstream row  29   b  of second-row cells. Frame  30  is typically made by cutting (e.g., laser-cutting) its basic (i.e., raw) structure from a tube of, for example, Nitinol (followed by re-shaping and heat treating to form its shape-set structure). Although valve body  32  is therefore typically monolithic, because the resulting cellular structure of valve body  32  resembles an open lattice, it may be useful to describe it as defining a plurality of joists  28  that connect at nodes  100  to form the cellular structure. \\n     Typically, and as shown, each arm  46  is attached to and extends from a site  35  that is at the connection between two adjacent cells of upstream row  29   a.  That is, site  35  is a connection node between first-row cells. The tessellation between rows  29   a  and  29   b  is such that site  35  may alternatively be described as the upstream extremity of cells of downstream row  29   b.  That is, the upstream extremity of each second-row cell is coincident with a respective connection node between first-row cells. Site  35  is therefore a node  100  that connects four joists  28 . Upstream end  34  of valve body  32  may be described as defining alternating peaks and troughs, and sites  35  are downstream of the peaks (e.g., at the troughs). \\n     It is hypothesized by the inventors that connecting arm  46  to valve body  32  at site  35  (instead of at upstream end  34 ) maintains the length of the lumen of the tubular portion, but also advantageously reduces the distance that the tubular portion extends into the ventricle of the subject, and thereby reduces a likelihood of inhibiting blood flow out of the ventricle through the left ventricular outflow tract. It is further hypothesized by the inventors that because each site  35  is a node  100  that connects four joists (whereas each node  100  that is at upstream end  34  connects only two joists), sites  35  are more rigid, and therefore connecting arms  46  to valve body  32  at sites  35  provides greater rigidity to each arm. \\n     Sheeting  23  may comprise one or more individual sheets, which may or may not be connected to each other. The individual sheets may comprise the same or different materials. Typically, sheeting  23  comprises a fabric, e.g., comprising a polyester, such as polyethylene terephthalate. Arms  46  are typically covered with sheeting  23 . Typically, and as shown in  FIG. 1E , an annular sheet  25  of sheeting  23  is disposed over arms  46 , extending between the arms, e.g., so as to reduce a likelihood of paravalvular leakage. For some such applications, excess sheeting  23  is provided between arms  46 , so as to facilitate movement of arms  46  independently of each other. Annular sheet  25  typically covers the upstream side of arms  46 , but may alternatively or additionally cover the downstream side of the arms. \\n     Alternatively, each arm  46  may be individually covered in a sleeve of sheeting  23 , thereby facilitating independent movement of the arms. \\n     Arms  46 , and typically the sheeting that covers the arms, define an upstream support portion  40  of implant  20 . \\n     Other surfaces of frame assembly  22  may also be covered with sheeting  23 . Typically, sheeting  23  covers at least part of valve body  32 , e.g., defining a liner  27  that lines an inner surface of the valve body, and thereby defining lumen  38 . \\n     Support  40  has an upstream surface, and a downstream surface. Each arm  46  is typically curved such that a downstream surface of support  40  defines an annular concave region  152 , and an annular convex region  154  radially outward from the concave region. That is, in region  152  the downstream surface of support  40  (e.g., the downstream surface of each arm  46  thereof) is concave, and in region  154  the downstream surface of the support is convex. \\n     Concave region  152  extends radially between a concave-region inner radius r 1  and a concave-region outer radius r 2 . Convex region  154  extends radially between a convex-region inner radius r 3  and a concave-region outer radius r 4 . It is to be noted that in this context (including the specification and the claims), the term \u201cradius\u201d means a radial distance from axis ax 1 . \\n     For some applications, and as shown, each arm  46  has a serpentine shape, such that there is no discernable gap between concave region  152  and convex region  154 . For such applications, each arm  46  has an inflection point where region  152  transitions into region  154 . For such applications, radius r 2  and radius r 3  are coincident, and collectively define an inflection radius at which the inflection point of each arm lies. \\n     For some applications, radius r 1  is the radius of tubular portion  32 . For some applications, there is a discernable gap between regions  152  and  154 . For example, each arm may be curved in regions  152  and  154 , but have a straight portion between these regions. \\n     Although regions  152  and  154  may be locally defined with respect to one or more particular arms  46 , these regions typically completely circumscribe axis ax 1 . \\n     Frame assembly  22  further comprises a plurality of legs  50 , each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward and in an upstream direction from a respective leg-base  66  to a respective leg-tip  68 . Each leg  50  defines a tissue-engaging flange  54 , which is typically the most radially outward part of the leg, and includes leg-tip  68 . Typically, legs  50  are defined by an outer frame (or \u201cleg frame\u201d)  60  that circumscribes and is coupled to valve frame  30 . \\n     Frames  30  and  60  define respective coupling elements  31  and  61 , which are fixed with respect to each other at coupling points  52 . For some applications, frames  30  and  60  are attached to each other only at coupling points  52 . Although frames  30  and  60  are attached to each other at coupling points  52 , radial forces may provide further coupling between the frames, e.g., frame  30  pressing radially outward against frame  60 . \\n     Typically, coupling points  52  are circumferentially aligned with legs  50  (and flanges  54  thereof), but circumferentially offset with respect to arms  46 . That is, the coupling points are typically at the same rotational position around axis ax 1  as the legs, but are rotationally staggered with respect to the rotational position of the arms. \\n     Coupling points  52  are typically disposed circumferentially around frame assembly  22  on a transverse plane that is orthogonal to axis ax 1 . That is, coupling points  52  are typically all disposed at the same longitudinal position along axis ax 1 . Typically, coupling points  52  are disposed longitudinally between upstream end  24  and downstream end  26  of frame assembly  22 , but not at either of these ends. Further typically, coupling points  52  are disposed longitudinally between upstream end  34  and downstream end  36  of tubular portion  32 , but not at either of these ends. As shown, tubular portion  32  is typically barrel-shaped\u2014i.e., slightly wider in the middle than at either end. For some applications, and as shown, coupling points  52  are disposed slightly downstream of the widest part of tubular portion  32 . For example, coupling points  52  may be 0.5-3 mm downstream of the widest part of tubular portion  32 . Alternatively or additionally, the longitudinal distance between the widest part of tubular portion  32  and coupling points  52  may be 20-50 percent (e.g., 20-40 percent) of the longitudinal distance between the widest part of the tubular portion and downstream end  36 . \\n     Coupling elements  31  are typically defined by (or at least directly attached to) legs  50 . Therefore legs  50  are fixedly attached to frame  30  at coupling points  52 . Despite the fixed attachment of legs  50  to frame  30 , frame  60  comprises a plurality of struts  70  that extend between, and connect, adjacent legs. Struts  70  are typically arranged in one or more rings  72 , e.g., a first (e.g., upstream) ring  74  and a second (e.g., downstream) ring  76 . For some applications, and as shown, frame  60  comprises exactly two rings  72 . Each ring is defined by a pattern of alternating peaks  64  and troughs  62 , the peaks being further upstream than the troughs. Each ring is typically coupled to legs  50  at troughs  62 \u2014i.e., such that peaks  64  are disposed circumferentially between the legs. Peaks  64  are therefore typically circumferentially aligned with arms  46 . That is, peaks  64  are typically at the same rotational position around axis ax 1  as arms  46 . \\n     The elongate element of frame  60  that defines leg  50  continues in a downstream direction past ring  74  and coupling element  61 , and couples ring  74  to ring  76 . However, throughout this patent application, leg  50  itself is defined as the free portion of this elongate element that extends from ring  74 . Leg-base  66  may be defined as the region of leg  50  that is coupled to the remainder of frame  60  (e.g., to ring  74 ). Because each leg  50  extends in a generally upstream direction, leg-base  66  may also be defined as the most downstream region of leg  50 . \\n     In the expanded state, the leg-tip  68  of each leg is typically disposed radially between radius r 3  and radius r 4 . That is, the leg-tip  68  of each leg is aligned with convex region  154 . \\n     Frame  60  is typically cut from a single tube, e.g., of Nitinol. Therefore, the radial thickness of the frame is typically consistent throughout\u2014e.g., it is the wall thickness of the tube from which it was cut. However, the circumferential width of components of frame  60  (i.e., the width of the component measured around the circumference of the frame) may differ. For example, for some applications, a circumferential thickness W 2  of legs  50  may be at least three times greater than a circumferential thickness W 1  of struts  70 . Greater circumferential thickness typically provides the component with greater rigidity. \\n     Valve frame  30  and outer frame  60  are typically each cut from respective metallic tubes, e.g., of Nitinol. This is typically the case for each of the implants described herein. More specifically, for each of the implants described herein:\\n         (1) the valve frame is typically cut from a metallic tube to form a raw valve-frame structure in which the arms and the projections extend axially from the valve body, and the raw valve-frame structure is subsequently shape-set to form a shape-set valve-frame structure in which (i) the valve body is wider than in the raw valve-frame structure, and (ii) the arms extend radially outward from the valve body; and   (2) the outer frame is typically cut from a metallic tube to form a raw outer-frame structure in which the legs (including the flanges) extend axially, and the raw outer-frame structure is subsequently shape-set to form a shape-set outer-frame structure in which (i) the rings are wider than in the raw outer-frame structure, and (ii) the flanges extend radially outward from the rings.       \\n\\n     Prosthetic leaflets  58  are disposed within lumen  38 , and are configured to facilitate one-way liquid flow through the lumen from upstream end  34  to downstream end  36 . Leaflets  58  thereby define the orientation of the upstream and downstream ends of valve body  32 , and of implant  20  in general. \\n     Typically, implant  20  is biased (e.g., shape-set) to assume its expanded state. For example, frames  30  and  60  may be constructed from a shape-memory metal such as Nitinol or a shape-memory polymer. Transitioning of implant  20  between the respective states is typically controlled by delivery apparatus, such as by constraining the implant in a compressed state within a capsule and/or against a control rod, and selectively releasing portions of the implant to allow them to expand. \\n       FIG. 2  shows implant  20  in its compressed state, for delivery to the heart of the subject, e.g., within a capsule  170  or delivery tube. Capsule  90  may be a capsule or a catheter. For clarity, only frame assembly  22  of implant  20  is shown. In the compressed state, arms  46  define a ball  48  at an end of valve body  32 . It is to be noted that in this context, the term \u201cball\u201d (including the specification and the claims) means a substantially bulbous element. The ball may be substantially spherical, spheroid, ovoid, or another bulbous shape. \\n     In the compressed state, frame assembly  22  defines a waist  56  (i.e., is waisted) at a longitudinal site between the valve body and the ball. For some applications, and as shown, waist  56  is longitudinally upstream of frame  60 , and is therefore primarily defined by valve frame  30 . However, for some such applications, the downstream limit of the waist may be defined by the upstream limit of frame  60  (e.g., flanges  54  thereof). \\n     It is to be noted that, typically, the bulbous shape of ball  48  is interrupted at waist  56 , i.e., where the frame transitions from the ball to the waist. For some applications, and as shown, valve frame  30  is monolithic (e.g., cut from a single metal tube), and defines both valve body  32  and arms  46 . For some applications, and as shown, in the compressed state, the overall shape of valve frame  30  resembles that of an air rifle pellet or a shuttlecock (e.g., see the cross-section in  FIG. 2 ). For some applications, a longitudinal cross-section of frame  30  has an overall shape that resembles a keyhole. \\n     For some applications, at waist  56 , frame  30  (and typically frame assembly  22  overall) has a transverse diameter d 10  that is less than 5 mm (e.g., 2-4 mm). For some applications, ball  48  has a greatest transverse diameter d 11  of 8-12 mm (e.g., 9-11 mm). For some applications, transverse diameter d 10  is less than 40 percent (e.g., less than 30 percent, such as 10-30 percent) of transverse diameter d 11 . \\n     Due to waist  56 , while implant  20  is in its compressed state and disposed within capsule  90 , the implant and capsule define a toroidal gap  57  therebetween. Toroidal gap  57  circumscribes longitudinal axis ax 1  of the implant around waist  56 . Therefore, valve body  32  extends in a first longitudinal direction (i.e., in a generally downstream direction) away from gap  57 , and arms  46  extend in a second longitudinal direction (i.e., in a generally upstream direction) away from the gap. For applications in which implant  20  is delivered to the native valve transfemorally, valve body  32  is closer to the open end of capsule  90  than is gap  57 , and arms  46  (e.g., ball  48 ) are further from the open end of capsule  90  than is gap  57 . For some applications, and as shown, a downstream limit of gap  57  is defined by the tips of flanges  54 . For some applications, and as shown, an upstream limit of gap  57  is defined by the downstream side of arms  46 . \\n     It is to be noted that, typically, frame  60  is disposed only downstream of toroidal gap  57 , but the frame  30  is disposed both upstream and downstream of the toroidal gap. \\n     Reference is again made to  FIG. 1E . For some applications, implant  20  comprises a polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., Teflon) ring  78  attached to downstream end  26 . Ring  78  circumscribes lumen  38  at downstream end  36  of valve body  32 , and typically at downstream end  26  of implant  20 . Therefore ring  78  serves as a downstream lip of lumen  38 . Typically, ring  78  is attached (e.g., stitched) to both frame  30  and frame  60 . For example, ring  78  may be attached to frame  60  at troughs  62 . For some applications, ring  78  is stitched to downstream end  36  of valve body  32  by stiches  99  that wrap around the ring (i.e., through the opening of the ring and around the outside of the ring) but do not pierce the ring (i.e., the material of the ring). \\n     Typically, ring  78  covers downstream end  26  of the implant (e.g., covers the frames at the downstream end). It is hypothesized by the inventors that ring  78  advantageously protects tissue (e.g., native leaflets and/or chordae tendineae) from becoming damaged by downstream end  26  of implant  20 . There is therefore provided, in accordance with some applications of the invention, apparatus comprising:\\n         a valve body, having an upstream end and a downstream end, shaped to define a lumen from the upstream end to the downstream end, the lumen defining a longitudinal axis of the prosthetic valve, and the downstream end of the valve body having;   a fabric liner, lining the lumen;   a valve member, disposed within the lumen of the valve body; and   a polytetrafluoroethylene ring coupled to the downstream end of the valve body such that the ring circumscribes the lumen at the downstream end of the valve body.       \\n\\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 3A-F , which are schematic illustrations showing the implantation of implant  20  at a native valve  10  of a heart  4  of a subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Valve  10  is shown as a mitral valve of the subject, disposed between a left atrium  6  and a left ventricle  8  of the subject. However, implant  20  may be implanted at another heart valve of the subject, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, although  FIGS. 3A-F  show implant  20  being delivered transseptally via a sheath  88 , the implant may alternatively be delivered by any other suitable route, such as transatrially, or transapically. \\n     Implant  20  is delivered, in its compressed state, to native valve  10  using a delivery tool  160  that is operable from outside the subject ( FIG. 3A ). Tool  160  typically comprises an extracorporeal controller  162  (e.g., comprising a handle) at a proximal end of the tool, and a shaft  164  extending from the controller to a distal portion of the tool. At the distal portion of tool  160 , the tool typically comprises a capsule  170  comprising one or more capsule portions  172 ,  174  (described below), and a mount  166 . Mount  166  is coupled (typically fixed) to shaft  164 . Controller  162  is operable to control deployment of implant  20  by transitioning the tool between a delivery state ( FIG. 3A ), an intermediate state ( FIG. 3E ), and an open state ( FIG. 3F ). Typically, implant  20  is delivered within capsule  170  of tool  160  in its delivery state, the capsule retaining the implant in the compressed state. Implant  20  typically comprises one or more appendages  80  at downstream end  26 , each appendage typically shaped to define a catch or other bulbous element at the end of the appendage, and to engage mount  166 , e.g., by becoming disposed within notches in the mount. Appendages  80  are typically defined by valve frame  30 , but may alternatively be defined by outer frame  60 . Capsule  170  retains appendages  80  engaged with mount  166  by retaining implant  20  (especially downstream end  26  thereof) in its compressed state. A transseptal approach, such as a transfemoral approach, is shown. At this stage, frame assembly  22  of implant  20  is as shown in  FIG. 2 . \\n     Subsequently, flanges  54  are deployed\u2014i.e., are allowed to protrude radially outward, e.g., by releasing them from capsule  170  ( FIG. 3B ). For example, and as shown, capsule  170  may comprise a distal capsule-portion  172  and a proximal capsule-portion  174 , and the distal capsule-portion may be moved distally with respect to implant  20 , so as to expose flanges  54  while continuing to restrain upstream end  24  and downstream end  26  of implant  20 . In  FIG. 3B , upstream support portion  40  (e.g., arms  46 ) is disposed within capsule-portion  174 , and downstream end  36  of tubular portion  32  is disposed within capsule-portion  172 . \\n     Typically, and as shown in  FIGS. 3A-B , tool  160  is positioned such that when flanges  54  are deployed, they are deployed within atrium  6  and/or between leaflets  12  of the subject. Subsequently, the tool is moved downstream (distally, for a transseptal approach) until the leaflets are observed to coapt upstream of flanges  54  ( FIG. 3C ). It is hypothesized by the inventors that this reduces how far into ventricle  8  the flanges become disposed, and therefore reduces the distance that the deployed flanges must be moved in an upstream direction in order to subsequently engage the leaflets, and therefore reduces the likelihood of inadvertently or prematurely ensnaring tissue such as chordae tendineae. This is described in more detail, mutatis mutandis, in WO 2016/125160 to Hariton et al., filed Feb. 3, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference. \\n     Alternatively, flanges  54  may be initially deployed within ventricle  8 . \\n     Subsequently, implant  20  is moved upstream, such that flanges  54  engage leaflets  12  of valve  10  ( FIG. 3D ). \\n     Subsequently, delivery tool  160  is transitioned into its intermediate state, thereby allowing implant  20  to assume a partially-expanded state in which upstream support portion  40  is expanded, e.g., by releasing the upstream support portion from capsule  170  ( FIG. 3E ). For example, and as shown, proximal capsule-portion  174  may be moved proximally with respect to mount  166  and/or implant  20 , so as to expose upstream support portion  40  (e.g., arms  46 ). Typically, in this state, upstream support portion  40  has expanded to have a diameter that is at least 80 percent (e.g., at least 90 percent, e.g., at least 95 percent) of its diameter in the expanded state of implant  20  (e.g., the diameter after implantation is complete), while downstream end  26  of the implant remains compressed. For some applications, in the partially-expanded state, upstream support portion  40  has expanded to its fully-expanded diameter. That is, downstream end  36  of tubular portion  32  remaining disposed within capsule-portion  172  typically does not inhibit, by more than 20 percent, if at all, the expansion of upstream support portion  40 . However, in the partially-expanded state of implant  20 , legs  50  are partially inhibited from expanding, such that each leg-tip  68  is radially aligned with concave region  152 . That is, each leg-tip  68  is disposed radially between concave-region inner radius r 1  and concave-region outer radius r 2 . \\n     In the intermediate state, leaflets  12  of native valve  10  are sandwiched between upstream support portion  40  (e.g., annular sheet  25  thereof) and legs  50  (e.g., flanges  54  thereof). It is to be noted that appendages  80  remain engaged with mount  166 . \\n     Subsequently, delivery tool  160  is transitioned into its open state, thereby allowing implant  20  to expand toward its expanded state (i.e., such that tubular portion  32  widens to its fully-expanded state) ( FIG. 3F ). For example, capsule-portion  172  may be moved distally with respect to mount  166  and/or implant  20 . The resulting expansion of downstream end  26  of implant  20  disengages appendages  80 , and thereby implant  20  as a whole, from mount  166 . Appendages  80  are not visible in  FIG. 3F  (or  FIG. 3C ) because they are obscured by ring  78 . \\n     In the expanded state of implant  20 , each leg-tip  68  is radially aligned with convex region  154 . That is, each leg-tip  68  is disposed radially between convex-region inner radius r 3  and convex-region outer radius r 4 . This is also illustrated in  FIG. 1C . \\n     Tool  160  (e.g., capsule-portion  172  thereof) may then be withdrawn via lumen  38  of implant  20 , and removed from the body of the subject. \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 4, and 5A -C, which are schematic illustrations of implants, in accordance with some applications of the invention.  FIG. 4  shows an implant  120 .  FIG. 5A  shows an implant  220 ,  FIG. 5B  shows a frame assembly  222  of implant  220  after shape-setting, and  FIG. 5C  shows a valve frame  230  of frame assembly  222  prior to shape-setting (i.e., the shape-set valve-frame structure). \\n     Implants  120  and  220  are typically the same as implant  20 , described hereinabove, except where noted. Sheeting  23  forms annular sheet  25  that is disposed over and typically stitched to arms  46 . Implant  120  thereby comprises valve body  32  (e.g., as described hereinabove), and an upstream support portion  140  that itself comprises arms  46  and annular sheet  25 . Similarly, implant  220  comprises valve body  32  and an upstream support portion  240  that itself comprises arms  46  and annular sheet  25 . \\n     Implants  120  and  220  each further comprises a respective plurality of elongate projections  146  or  246 . Whereas arms  46  are covered by sheeting  23 , the projections extend in an upstream direction through sheeting  23 . For some applications, and as shown for projections  146 , the projections extend through annular sheet  25 . For some applications, and as shown for projections  246 , the projections extend between annular sheet  25 , and a portion of sheeting  23  that lines valve body  32  (e.g., at a seam where these two portions of sheeting  23  are joined). The projections and arms  46  are both configured to be positioned in atrium  6  of the heart. For some applications, and as shown for projections  146 , the projections extend through annular sheet  25 . \\n     It is to be noted that projection  146  and  246  are distinct from appendages  80 , which are disposed at the other end of the valve body. \\n     Each projection terminates in a nub  148  or  248  that facilitates snaring of the projection using a transcatheter snare, lasso, or similar tool. It is to be understood that the shapes shown for the nubs are merely examples, and that the scope of the invention includes any suitably shaped nub. It is hypothesized by the inventors that the projections facilitate repositioning and/or retrieval of the implant during and/or after implantation, using a snare, lasso, or similar tool. The projections are typically positioned and/or shaped such that nubs  148  or  248  are not in contact with annular sheet  25  or atrial tissue (e.g., are disposed at least 5 mm away (e.g., 5-25 mm away) from annular sheet  25  or atrial tissue). For some applications, and as shown for projections  146  of implant  120 , the projections curve outwards and then inwards toward the central longitudinal axis of the implant (i.e., are shaped to be concave toward the axis). For some applications, and as shown for projections  246  of implant  220 , the projections do not extend radially outward from the valve body. Projections  246  typically extend axially in an upstream direction away from the valve body (i.e., generally parallel to axis ax 1 , i.e., within 10 degrees of axis ax 1 ). \\n     Regarding implant  120  ( FIG. 4 ), projections  146  extend from sites  35  in a similar way to arms  46 . Projections  146  may be structurally similar to arms  46 , and may even be identically cut when frame  30  is initially cut from the original metal tube (i.e., in the raw valve-frame structure). However, projections  146  have a different curvature to arms  46  (e.g., they may be bent differently post-cutting), and are curved such that they extend through annular sheet  25 . Whereas at least some of arms  46  typically reach and press against the atrial wall, projections  146  are typically shaped such that nubs  148  are not in contact with the atrial wall. Typically, each projection  146  replaces an arm  46 , such that the cumulative sum of arms and projections is twelve.  FIG. 4  shows an embodiment comprising six arms  46  and six projections  146 , but the scope of the invention includes other ratios, such as nine arms  46  and three projections  146 . \\n       FIG. 5A  shows implant  220 , comprising a frame assembly  222 , leaflets  58 , and sheeting  23 .  FIG. 5B  shows frame assembly  222  alone, the frame assembly comprising (i) a valve frame  230  that defines valve body  32 , and (ii) an outer frame  260 .  FIG. 5C  shows the basic structure of valve frame  230 , as it is initially cut from a tube (typically a metallic tube, such as a Nitinol tube), e.g., before the frame is shape-set into the shape shown in  FIG. 5B . Although this basic structure is tubular,  FIG. 5C  depicts the structure two-dimensionally, as though the cut-out structure were cut longitudinally, and unrolled to become flat. \\n     Except where noted, frame assembly  222 , valve frame  230 , and outer frame  260  are typically identical to frame assembly  22 , valve frame  30 , and outer frame  60 , mutatis mutandis. For some applications, implant  220  is identical to implant  20  except for projections  246 . \\n     In contrast to projections  146  of implant  120 , each projection  246  of implant  220  extends from a respective site  37  that is at the upstream extremity (i.e., peak) of a respective first-row cell of upstream row  29   a  of valve body  32  (i.e., from upstream end  34  of the valve body). Projections  246  thereby alternate with, rather than replace, arms  46 . Therefore, it is possible for implant  220  to comprise projections  246  in addition to twelve arms  46 . Implant  220  may comprise an equal number of projections  246  and arms  46 , but typically, the implant comprises fewer projections than arms. For example, implant  220  may comprise half as many, or fewer, projections  246  than arms  46 \u2014e.g., a third as many, or a quarter as many projections as arms. Projections  246  and arms  46  are typically evenly distributed circumferentially, and therefore typically at least two arms (e.g., at least three arms, such as at least four arms) are disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections.  FIGS. 5A-C  show implant  220  comprising three projections  246  and twelve arms  46 , with four arms disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections.  FIGS. 11A-B , described hereinbelow, show an implant in which three arms are disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections. \\n     Each projection  246  has a projection-length d 13 , measured from the upstream extremity of the respective first-row cell (i.e., from site  37 ). Each of the arms has an arm-length d 14 , measured from the upstream extremity of the respective second-row cell (i.e., site  35 ). Arm-length d 14  is greater than projection-length d 13  (e.g., 2-20 times greater, e.g., 4-20 times greater, such as 4-10 times greater). For some applications, arm-length d 14  is 20-28 mm, such as 22-26 mm (e.g., 22-23 mm, 23.5-24.5 mm, or 25-26 mm). For some applications, projection-length d 13  is 2-10 mm (e.g., 3-8 mm, e.g., 4-6 mm, such as about 5 mm). \\n     Typically, each arm  46  (i) has a narrow portion  46   a  that is attached to, and extends from, the upstream extremity of the respective second-row cell, and (ii) at a widening zone  46   b,  widens into a wide portion  46   c  that extends from the narrow portion, and is wider than the narrow portion. Narrow portion  46   a  has a narrow-portion length d 20  that is typically at least 30 percent of arm-length d 14  (e.g., at least 40 percent, such as 40-80 percent, such as 40-60 percent). Wide portion  46   c  has a wide-portion length that is at least 30 percent of arm-length d 14  (e.g., at least 40 percent, such as 40-80 percent, such as 40-60 percent). \\n     Wide portion  46   c  has a width d 15  that is typically 1.5-6 times greater (e.g., 2-4 times greater, such as 2.5-3.5 times greater) than a width d 16  of narrow portion  46   a.  For some applications width d 15  is 1-2 mm (e.g., 1.4-1.8 mm, such as 1.6 mm). Width d 16  is typically 0.2-0.8 mm (e.g., 0.4-0.6 mm, such as 0.5 mm). It is to be noted that, although individual parts of arm  46  within portion  46   c  may be narrower than within portion  46   a,  these individual parts form a back-and-forth pattern that results in wide portion  46   c  being, overall, wider than narrow portion  46   a.  Typically, wide portion  46   c  is more flexible, in at least one plane, than narrow portion  46   a.  Therefore, wide portion  46   c  is also a flexible portion of arm  46 . \\n     Each projection  246  has a width d 17  that is typically 0.2-0.8 mm (e.g., 0.4-0.6 mm, such as 0.5 mm). Each nub has a nub-width d 18  that is typically 1-2 mm (e.g., 1.4-1.8 mm, such as 1.6 mm), and a nub-length d 19  that is typically 0.5-1 mm (e.g., 0.7-0.9 mm, such as 0.8 mm). Wide portion  46   c  is typically at least 3 times (e.g., at least 10 times) longer than nub-length d 19 . \\n     As described hereinabove, the valve frame is typically monolithic, cut from a single tube. Typically, and as shown in  FIG. 5C , while valve frame  230  is in its raw valve-frame structure (e.g., described hereinabove with reference to  FIGS. 1A-E , mutatis mutandis), nubs  248  are disposed between arms  46 . As shown in  FIG. 5C , arms  46  and projections  246  may be dimensioned such that, while valve frame  230  is in its raw valve-frame structure, nubs  248  are disposed between narrow portions  46   a  of arms  46 . That is, nubs  248  may be disposed axially closer than wide portion  46   c  to valve body  32 . Thereby, arms  46  and projections  246  efficiently fit adjacently to each other within a single cutout from tube of a particular diameter. Narrow-portion length d 20  is typically greater than projection-length d 13  (e.g., at least 1.5 times greater, such as 1.5-3 times greater). \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 6 , which shows the basic structure of a variant  230   a  of valve frame  230 , in accordance with some applications of the invention.  FIG. 6  shows variant  230   a  as it is initially cut from a tube (typically a metallic tube, such as a Nitinol tube), e.g., before the frame is shape-set.  FIG. 6  shows a two-dimensional view, as though the cut-out structure were cut longitudinally, and unrolled to become flat. Similarly to with frame  230  ( FIG. 5C ), nubs  248  of variant  230   a  are disposed between arms  46 . However, projections  246   a  of variant  230   a  are longer than projections  246  of frame  230 , and nubs  248   a  are therefore disposed between wide portions  46   c  of arms  46 . In order to accommodate this, in frame  230   a,  at least the arms  46  that are adjacent to nubs  248   a  are deflected circumferentially (which is represented two-dimensionally as being laterally deflected) compared to their positions in frame  230 , and are typically unevenly spaced. During subsequent shape setting, arms  46  are typically circumferentially displaced, e.g., such that they are evenly spaced. Variant  230   a  may be used in place of any other valve frame described herein, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, variant  230   a  may be used in combination with other technologies described herein, mutatis mutandis. \\n     Reference is made to  FIG. 7 , which is a schematic illustration of an outer frame  60   a,  in accordance with some applications of the invention. Outer frame  60   a  is typically identical to outer frame  60  except that peaks  64   a  of frame  60   a  have a larger radius of curvature than do peaks  64  of frame  60 . Outer frame  60   a  may be used in place of any other outer frame described herein, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, frame  60   a  may be used in combination with other technologies described herein, mutatis mutandis. \\n     Reference is made to  FIG. 8 , which is a schematic illustration of a frame assembly  22   b,  in accordance with some applications of the invention. Frame assembly  22   b  comprises a valve frame  30   b  and an outer frame  60   b.  Except where noted, frame assembly  22   b,  valve frame  30   b,  and outer frame  60   b  are as described for frame assembly  22 , valve frame  30 , and outer frame  60 , respectively. \\n     Outer frame  60   b  comprises (or defines) (1) a first (e.g., upstream) ring  74   b  defined by a pattern of alternating first-ring peaks and first-ring troughs, (2) a second (e.g., downstream) ring  76   b  defined by a pattern of alternating second-ring peaks and second-ring troughs, and a plurality of legs  50 , each of the legs coupled to the first ring and the second ring, and extending radially outward. \\n     Valve frame  30   b  comprises a tubular portion (e.g., a tubular frame) that has a cellular structure defined by a plurality of metallic elements with spaces therebetween a e.g., as described for valve frame  30 , mutatis mutandis. \\n     The cellular structure of the valve frames described herein may also be viewed as defining rings of alternating peaks and troughs, the rings circumscribing the longitudinal axis of the implant. Whereas the waveform (i.e., the peak-trough waveform) of the rings of the outer frame are in phase with each other, the phase of the waveform of the rings of the valve frame typically alternate with respect to each other. That is, for the valve frame, the waveform of one ring is out of phase (e.g., is in antiphase) with that of its axially-adjacent rings. For example, and with reference to  FIG. 1B , valve frame  30  defines a first (e.g., upstream) ring  182 , a second (e.g., middle) ring  184 , and a third (e.g., downstream) ring  186 , and ring  184  is in antiphase with rings  182  and  184 . Valve frame  30   b  similarly defines a first (e.g., upstream) ring  182   b,  a second (e.g., middle) ring  184   b,  and a third (e.g., downstream) ring  186   b,  and ring  184   b  is in antiphase with rings  182   b  and  184   b.    \\n     Typically, and as shown for each of the implants described herein, when the frame assembly is assembled, (1) the waveform of one of outer frame rings is in-phase with the waveform of the inner frame ring with which it is axially aligned, and (2) the waveform of one of outer frame rings is out of phase (e.g., is in antiphase) with the waveform of the inner frame ring with which it is axially aligned. For example, and with reference to  FIG. 1C , ring  74  is in-phase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring  184 ), whereas ring  76  is in antiphase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring  186 ). Similarly, for frame assembly  22   b,  ring  74   b  is in-phase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring  184   b ), whereas ring  76   b  is in antiphase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring  186   b ). \\n     Because ring  76   b  is in antiphase with ring  186   b,  the peaks of ring  76   b  are not disposed directly radially outward from respective parts of frame  30   b,  and therefore are not in contact with frame  30   b.  However, despite ring  74   b  being in phase with ring  184   b,  and the peaks of ring  74   b  being disposed directly radially outward from respective parts of frame  30   b,  the peaks of ring  74   b  are also not in contact with frame  30   b.  That is, frame assembly  22  defines a radial gap  188  between frames  30  and  60  at the peaks of ring  74   b.  Typically, therefore, none of the peaks of the rings of frame  60   b  is in contact with inner frame  30   b.  In contrast, for frame assembly  22 , although the peaks of ring  76  are not in contact with frame  30 , the peaks of ring  74  typically are in contact with frame  30 . \\n     The features of frame assembly  22   b  may be used in combination with other implants described herein. For example, other frame assemblies described herein may be shaped to define gap  188 , mutatis mutandis. \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 9A-B , which are schematic illustrations of an inner frame  330   a,  and an implant  320   a  comprising inner frame  330   a,  in accordance with some applications of the invention. Inner frame  330   a  may be used in place of other inner frames of implants described herein, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, frame  330   a  may be used in combination with other technologies described herein, mutatis mutandis. Inner frame  330   a  comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion)  332   a  that has an upstream end  334   a  and a downstream end  336   a,  and is shaped to define a lumen through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve frame  330   a  further comprises a plurality of arms  46 , each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body  332   a.    \\n     Valve body  332   a  has a cellular structure defined by a plurality of joists  28  connected at a plurality of nodes  102 , the joists and nodes delimiting cells of the cellular structure. Except where noted, inner frame  330   a  is generally the same as inner frame  230  (or inner frame  30 ), mutatis mutandis, and valve body  332   a  is generally the same as valve body  32 , mutatis mutandis. Compared to valve body  32 , valve body  332   a  comprises additional joists  28 , which are hypothesized by the inventors to increase strength and rigidity. In particular, the additional joists are hypothesized by the inventors to increase the resistance of the valve body to compression toward axis ax 1 , including resistance to circumferential compression (e.g., compression that would otherwise reduce the diameter of the valve body, but that would retain the valve body in a generally cylindrical shape) and localized compression (e.g., compression that would otherwise reduce the diameter of the valve body at only certain locations, causing the valve body to become more oval in transverse cross-section). \\n     Referring back to  FIGS. 1A-B , the cellular structure of valve body  32  is such that its nodes  100  typically connect 2-4 of its joists. For example, a node  100   a  connects two joists, and a node  100   b  connects four joists. (In this context, neither arms  46  nor projections  246  are joists of the valve body&#39;s cellular structure, and so sites  35  and  34  are also nodes that connect 2-4 joists.) In contrast, the cellular structure of valve body  332   a  is such that some of its nodes  102  are minor nodes  104 , and some are major nodes  106 . Minor nodes  104  connect 2-4 joists, whereas major nodes  106  connect 6-8 joists. Typically, and as shown, major nodes  106  connect 6 joists (again, excluding arms  46 , which are not joists of the valve body&#39;s cellular structure). Typically, and as shown, minor nodes  104  connect 2 joists. Therefore, for some applications, none of the nodes  102  of the cellular structure of valve body  332   a  connects 4 joists. \\n     Similarly to valve body  32  of frame  30 , the cells of the cellular structure of valve body  332   a  comprise a first circumferential row  109   a  of cells, and a second circumferential row  109   b  of cells. That is, row  109   a  is a row of first-row cells, and row  109   b  is a row of second-row cells. Each of the cells of row  109   a  is connected to each of its circumferentially-adjacent first-row cells at a respective major node  106 . Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row  109   a  is longitudinally delimited by two minor nodes  104  (i.e., the upstream end and the downstream end of each cell is at a respective minor node). It is to be noted that, typically, each of the cells of row  109   a  is not connected to another cell at these minor nodes  104  (i.e., the minor nodes that longitudinally delimit the first-row cell). \\n     Each of the cells of row  109   b  is connected to each of its circumferentially-adjacent second-row cells at a respective major node  106 . Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row  109   b  is longitudinally delimited by at least one major node  106  (e.g., is delimited by one major node at an upstream end of the cell). Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row  109   b  is also longitudinally delimited by a minor node  104  (e.g., at a downstream end of the cell). For some applications, and as shown, each of the major nodes  106  at which circumferentially-adjacent first-row cells are connected is also the major node that longitudinally-delimits a respective second-row cell (e.g., at the upstream end of the second-row cell). In the example shown, that common major node  106  is also site  35 , at which arms  46  are attached to the valve body. \\n     The cells of the cellular structure of valve body  332   a  are typically delimited by exactly four nodes  102 . \\n     Frame  330   a  defines coupling elements  31 , which are fixed to coupling elements  61  of frame  60  at coupling points, as described hereinabove for frame assembly  22 , mutatis mutandis. For some applications, and as shown, coupling elements  31  are defined by respective major nodes  106 . Therefore, for some applications, a frame assembly comprises (i) inner frame  330   a  that defines valve body  332   a,  and (ii) an outer frame (e.g., frame  60 ) that circumscribes the valve body, and is coupled to the inner frame by being fixed to major nodes of the valve body. For such applications, coupling elements  31  are typically defined by the major nodes at which circumferentially-adjacent second-row cells are connected. \\n     For some applications, and as shown, valve body  332   a  is defined by exactly two stacked, tessellated rows  109  of cells. That is, typically, first row  109   a  is the most upstream row, second row  108   b  is the most downstream row, and these two rows are tessellated with each other. Therefore, for some applications, all the cells of the cellular structure of valve body  332   a  are either first-row cells or second-row cells. \\n     Valve body  332   a  may be described as comprising pairs  108  of joists  28  that run generally parallel to each other. In the expanded state of the valve body (i.e., the state shown in  FIG. 7 ) the joists  28  of each pair  108  are disposed 0.1-1 mm (e.g., 0.25-0.9 mm, such as 0.25-0.65 mm) from each other. Although the joists  28  of each pair  108  run generally parallel to each other, they typically only share one node  102  in common. That shared common node is typically a major node  106 . That is, at a first end of each pair  108 , both joists  28  are typically connected to each other at a major node. In some cases, at a second end of each pair  108 , one of the joists connects to another major node  106 , but the other joist connects to a minor node  104  that is disposed a distance d 12  away from the major node at the second end of the pair. In other cases, at the second end of each pair  108 , one of the joists connects to a first minor node, and the other joist connects to another minor node that is disposed a distance d 12  away from the first minor node. Distance d 12  is typically 0.1-1 mm (e.g., 0.25-0.9 mm, such as 0.25-0.65 mm). \\n     For some applications, and as shown, the arrangement of joists  28  in pairs  108  results in the joists that delimit the cells of first row  109   a  not delimiting the cells of second row  109   b . That is, for some applications, no individual joist  28  delimits both a first-row cell and a second-row cell. \\n     Another aspect of valve body  332   a  is as follows: Major nodes  106  are typically arranged in major-node rows, each major-node row circumscribing longitudinal axis ax 1  at a respective major-node-row longitudinal site, and minor nodes  104  are typically arranged in minor-node rows, each minor-node row circumscribing the longitudinal axis at a respective minor-node-row longitudinal site. Along at least part of axis ax 1 , the minor-node-row longitudinal sites alternate with the major-node-row longitudinal sites. For some applications, along at least this part of axis ax 1 , at least 3 minor-node-row longitudinal sites alternate with at least 2 major-node-row longitudinal sites, e.g., in the order minor-major-minor-major-minor, as shown. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 10A-B , which are schematic illustrations of an inner frame  330   b,  and an implant  320   b  comprising inner frame  330   b,  in accordance with some applications of the invention. Inner frame  330   b  may be used in place of other inner frames of implants described herein, mutatis mutandis. \\n     Inner frame  330   b  comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion)  332   b  that has an upstream end  334   b  and a downstream end  336   b,  and is shaped to define a lumen through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve frame  330   b  further comprises a plurality of arms  46 , each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body  332   b.  Inner frame  330   b  is typically the same as inner frame  330   a,  except where noted. Compared to inner frame  330   a,  inner frame  330   b  comprises additional joists  28  at upstream end  334   b.  That is, in contrast to inner frame  330   a,  for inner frame  330   b  pairs  108  of joists are also disposed at the upstream side of the upstream row of cells. \\n     In frame  330   a,  sites  37  are coincident with the upstream extremity of a respective upstream-row cell. In contrast, in frame  330   b,  sites  37  are not coincident with the upstream extremity of a respective upstream-row cell. Rather, sites  37  are coincident with a minor node that joins the joists that are paired with (e.g., that are parallel with) the joists of the respective upstream-row cell. \\n     Implant  320   b  is typically the same as implant  320   a,  except that it comprises inner frame  330   b  instead of inner frame  330   a.    \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 11A-B , which are schematic illustrations of an inner frame  330   c,  and an implant  320   c  comprising inner frame  330   c,  in accordance with some applications of the invention. Inner frame  330   c  may be used in place of other inner frames of implants described herein, mutatis mutandis. \\n     Inner frame  330   c  comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion)  332   c  that has an upstream end  334   c  and a downstream end  336   c,  and is shaped to define a lumen through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve frame  330   c  further comprises a plurality of arms  46 , each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body  332   c.  Inner frame  330   c  is typically the same as inner frame  330   b,  except where noted. \\n     In general, for implants having an expandable cellular structure, such as the valve bodies described herein, for a given size of the implant, a cellular structure that defines fewer, larger cells, advantageously facilitates radial compression (i.e., \u201ccrimping\u201d) to a smaller diameter than does a comparable cellular structure that defines more, smaller cells. However, this is typically at the expense of strength and rigidity of the expanded valve. As described hereinabove, the presence of additional joists  28  (e.g., in inner frames  330   a,    330   b,  and  330   c ) to form pairs  108  is hypothesized to increase strength and rigidity, in particular with respect to compression toward the central longitudinal axis. As a result, it is further hypothesized by the inventors that using such a paired joist cellular structure facilitates reducing the number, and increasing the size, of the cells of the valve body, in order to achieve a valve body that is radially compressible to a smaller diameter while maintaining sufficient strength and rigidity. \\n     Accordingly, valve body  332   c  of inner frame  330   c  has fewer, larger cells compared to valve body  32  of inner frame  30 , and is therefore radially compressible to a smaller diameter. Whereas each row of cells of valve body  32  includes 12 cells, each row of cells of valve body  332   c  includes 9 cells. More generally, whereas the rotationally-symmetrical pattern of valve body  32  has 12 repeats (e.g., 12 cells per cell row, 12 minor nodes per minor-node row, 12 major nodes per major-node row, 12 coupling elements, 12 arms  46 ), the rotationally-symmetrical pattern of valve body  332   c  has only 9 repeats. (Both valve body  32  and valve body  332   c  typically have 3 appendages  80  and 3 projections  246 .) Both valve body  32  and valve body  332   c  define two rows of cells. Therefore. whereas valve body  32  defines 24 cells in total, valve body  332   c  defines 18 cells in total. Whereas valve body  32  defines exactly 24 major nodes, valve body  332   c  defines exactly 18 major nodes. \\n     For some applications, and as shown, inner frame  330   c  comprises additional joists  28  at upstream end  334   c  (e.g., similarly to inner frame  330   b ). That is, for such applications, pairs  108  of joists are typically also disposed at the upstream side of the upstream row of cells of inner frame  330   c.  For such applications, implant  320   c  is typically the same as implant  320   b,  except that implant  320   c  comprises 9 rotationally-symmetrical repeats, rather than 12. \\n     For some applications, inner frame  330   c  does not comprise additional joists  28  at upstream end  334   c,  and is instead more like inner frame  330   a  in this regard. \\n     Reference is again made to  FIGS. 9A-11B . It is to be noted that although the above-described arrangements of joists connected at major and minor nodes are described in the context of a prosthetic heart valve, the scope of the invention includes using such arrangements in other implants or components thereof that comprise a cellular structure, such as stents. \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 12A-H , which are schematic illustrations of a technique for use with a frame of a prosthetic valve, in accordance with some applications of the invention. The technique is for augmenting a tissue-engaging flange of the frame with a soft pad  300 . To illustrate the technique,  FIGS. 12A-H  show the technique being used to augment flanges  54  of outer frame  60  with soft pads  300 , but it is to be noted that the technique may be used with any suitable frame, mutatis mutandis. \\n       FIG. 12A  shows frame  60 , which has tissue-engaging flanges  54 . A model  302  of a soft pad  300  with which each flange  54  is to be augmented is affixed to the respective flange ( FIG. 12B ). Subsequently, a mold  304  is formed by (i) positioning frame  60  such that models  302  are supported within a fluid  310   f  of a first substance  310  while the first substance solidifies, and (ii) subsequently, removing the models from the first substance, leaving a cavity in the solidified first substance. For example, and as shown in  FIGS. 12C-E , a bath  306  of fluid  310   f  may be prepared, and frame  60  may be inverted and lowered into the bath such that models  302  are supported within the fluid ( FIG. 12C ). First substance  310  is allowed to solidify into solidified first substance  310   s  ( FIG. 12D ). Subsequently, frame  60  is withdrawn from the bath, thereby removing models  302  from solidified first substance  310   s,  such that each model leaves a respective cavity  308  in solidified first substance  310   s  ( FIG. 12E ). \\n     Models  302  are then removed from flanges  54  ( FIG. 12F ). Pads  300  are then formed by: (i) placing flanges  54  in contact with a second substance  312  by repositioning the frame such that each flange is supported within a respective cavity  308 , and introducing a fluid  312   f  of the second substance to the cavity ( FIG. 12G ), and (ii) while the flange remains in contact with the second substance, allowing the second substance to solidify into solidified second substance  312   s  and to become affixed to the flange. Subsequently, flanges  54  are removed from cavities  308  with formed pads  300  (comprising solidified second substance  312   s ) affixed to the flanges ( FIG. 12H ). \\n     The technique described with reference to  FIGS. 12A-H  may be used with a frame that has a single tissue-engaging flange. However, as shown, the technique is typically used with a frame that has a plurality of flanges, e.g., to augment all the flanges simultaneously. It is to be noted that flanges  54  are not all disposed on the same side of frame assembly  22  (i.e., after frames  30  and  60  have been attached to each other). For example, flanges  54  are not all at the upstream end of the prosthetic valve or at the downstream end of the prosthetic valve. Rather, they are disposed downstream of the tips of arms  46  and upstream of downstream end  26 . Furthermore, flanges  54  are arranged circumferentially around the longitudinal axis of the prosthetic valve. Flanges  54  (and eventually pads  300 ) are arranged circumferentially around frame  30  longitudinally between the upstream end and the downstream end of frame  30 , exclusive. For some applications, the flanges being not all disposed on the same side might inhibit the use of the technique of  FIGS. 12A-H  to simultaneously augment all of the flanges. For example, it may be difficult to place all of models  302  into the fluid first substance, or to place all of flanges  54  into the fluid second substance, without also placing other portions of the frame assembly into the fluid substance. The two-frame nature of frame assembly  22  advantageously allows flanges  54  to be augmented with pads before frame  60  is attached to frame  30 . Because all of flanges  54  are disposed at the same side (e.g., the upstream side) of frame  60 , they can all be placed into the fluid substances simultaneously. \\n     An alternative solution is also contemplated by the inventors, in which an annular bath is positioned circumscribing the central portion of the prosthetic valve or frame assembly, such that all flanges can be placed into the fluid substances even when the flanges are not all disposed on the same side of a prosthetic valve or frame assembly. \\n     For some applications, substance  310  and/or substance  312  may be a mixture of constituents that is initially fluid upon mixing, and that solidifies as the constituents react with each other. For some applications, fluid substance  310   f  and/or fluid substance  312   f  is fluid because it is in a molten state, and solidifies as it cools. When solidified, second substance  312  is typically soft, flexible, and/or resilient. For some applications, second substance  312  (or at least solidified second substance  312   s ) is a foam. For some applications, second substance  312  comprises silicone, polyurethane, a thermoplastic elastomer such as Santoprene\u2122, and/or polyether block amide. \\n     For some applications, the techniques described with reference to  FIGS. 12A-H  are alternatively or additionally used, mutatis mutandis, to augment the downstream end of the implant with one or more pads, e.g., to serve a similar function to ring  78  described hereinabove. \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 13A-E ,  14 A-D,  15 A-C,  16 A-C,  17 ,  18 A-C, and  19 , which are schematic illustrations of an implant  420 , and steps in the assembly of the implant, in accordance with some applications of the invention. In particular, these figures illustrate steps in the attachment of various flexible components to the frame assembly of the implant, such as steps in the dressing of the frame assembly with various sheets of flexible material. Implant  420  is shown as comprising frame assembly  222 , and is typically identical to implant  220  except for where described otherwise. However, it is to be noted that the steps described with reference to  FIGS. 13A-18C  may be used, mutatis mutandis, to assemble other implants, including the other implants described herein. \\n       FIGS. 13A-E  show flexible components of implant  420 .  FIGS. 13A-B  are perspective and side views, respectively, of a valvular assembly  430 , comprising leaflets  58  arranged to serve as a check valve. In valvular assembly  430 , each leaflet  58  defines (i) an upstream surface  457 , past which blood will flow through implant  420  in an upstream-to-downstream direction, and (ii) a downstream surface  459 , against which blood will press when the valvular assembly closes and inhibits blood flow in a downstream-to-upstream direction. Valvular assembly  430  typically further comprises a liner  427  and/or a plurality of connectors  432 . Liner  427  of implant  420  generally corresponds to liner  27  of implant  20 , mutatis mutandis. Typically, valvular assembly  430  comprises three leaflets  58  and three connectors  432 . Connectors  432  couple the leaflets to each other to form commissures, and are used to secure the leaflets, at the commissures, to frame assembly  222 . Connectors  432  are arranged circumferentially, and leaflets  58  extend radially inward from the connectors. For some applications, valvular assembly  430 , and connectors  432  in particular, are as described in PCT patent application publication WO 2018/029680 to Hariton et al., and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/878,206 to Hariton et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n     Each leaflet  58  is attached (e.g., stitched) to liner  427  along a line (e.g., a stitch line)  437 . Each leaflet  58  defines a free edge  458 , which is typically straight, and at which the leaflet coapts with the other leaflets  58 . Stitch line  437  is typically curved. Each leaflet typically defines a curved edge (e.g., an upstream edge)  456  at which the leaflet is attached to liner  427 . The curve of edge  456  and/or stitch line  437  is concave toward the downstream end of valvular assembly  430 , such that edge  456  and/or stitch line  437  (i) become closer to the downstream end of the valvular assembly at connectors  432 , and (ii) are closest to the upstream end of the valvular assembly about midway circumferentially between the connectors. That is, edge  456  has an apex about midway circumferentially between connectors  432 . \\n     Typically, and as shown, leaflets  58  extend further axially downstream (i.e., downstream with respect to axis ax 1 ) than does liner  427 . Therefore, a downstream portion of each leaflet  58  is typically circumferentially exposed from liner  427 . For some applications, and as shown, liner  427  is shaped to define regions  428  at which a downstream edge  436  of the liner recedes from the downstream end of valvular assembly  430 . At each region  428 , more of the respective leaflet  58  is circumferentially exposed. Each region  428  is typically circumferentially aligned with the concavity defined by edge  456  and/or stitch line  437 . At regions  428 , downstream edge  436  of liner  427  is typically stitched to ring  182  of frame  230 . Therefore, for some applications, the most upstream parts of downstream edge  436  of liner  427  are closer to the upstream end of the implant than is the most downstream parts of arms  46 . As described in more detail hereinbelow, in implant  420 , regions  428  of liner  427  facilitate the provision of windows  482  into a pouch  490 . \\n       FIG. 13C  shows a sheet  440  of flexible material. Typically, and as shown, sheet  440  is provided flat, and in the shape of a major arc of an annulus, having a first arc-end  442   a  and a second arc-end  442   b.  Sheet  440  of implant  420  generally corresponds to annular sheet  25  of implant  20 , mutatis mutandis. \\n       FIG. 13D  shows a sheet  450  of flexible material. Sheet  450  is annular, and defines an inner perimeter  452 , an outer perimeter  454 , and a radial dimension d 21  therebetween. \\n       FIG. 13E  shows a sheet  460  of flexible material. Sheet  460  is shaped to define a belt  462  and a plurality of elongate strips  464 . Each strip  464  defines a respective central strip-axis ax 2 , and extends along its strip-axis from belt  462  to the end  466  of the strip. Typically, belt  462  is linear and defines a belt-axis ax 3 , and strip-axis ax 2  is orthogonal to the belt-axis. Typically, strips  464  are parallel to each other. Each strip  464  has first and second edges  468  (e.g., a first edge  468   a  and a second edge  468   b ), which extend on either side of axis ax 2 , between belt  462  and end  466 . \\n     As indicated by the reference numeral  23 , sheets  440 ,  450 , and  460  may all be considered components of sheeting  23 . For some applications, liner  427 , sheet  440 , sheet  450 , and/or  460  comprise (e.g., consist of) the same material as each other. Typically, sheets  440 ,  450 , and  460  are provided as flat, and are subsequently shaped during assembly of implant  420 , e.g., as described hereinbelow. \\n     For applications in which sheet  440  is provided flat and in the shape of a major arc of an annulus, sheet  440  is shaped into an open frustum by attaching (e.g., stitching) ends  442   a  and  442   b  together ( FIGS. 14A-B ). This is represented by a stitch line  444  in  FIG. 14B . Alternatively, sheet  440  may be provided in the open frustum shape. The open frustum shape has a greater perimeter  446  at a first base of the frustum, and a smaller perimeter  448  at a second base of the frustum. Perimeter  448  defines an opening, and sheet  440  is stitched to arms  46  such that the opening is aligned with the lumen defined by valve body  32  of frame  30  ( FIG. 14C ), and typically such that the sheet covers an upstream side of the arms.  FIG. 14D  shows valvular assembly  430  having been coupled to frame assembly  222 . This step may be performed after sheet  440  is stitched to arms  46  (as shown) or beforehand. Valvular assembly  430  is placed inside valve body  32  of frame  30 , and is attached by stitching connectors  432  and liner  427  to frame assembly  222 . Connectors  432  are typically stitched to ring  184  and/or ring  186 . For some applications, the attachment of connectors  432  to frame assembly  222  is as described in PCT patent application publication WO 2018/029680 to Hariton et al., and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/878,206 to Hariton et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n     Smaller perimeter  448  of sheet  440  is stitched to an upstream edge  434  of liner  427 , to form a substantially sealed channel through implant  420 . This stitching is represented by a stitch line  435 . Typically, and as shown, projections  246  extend between, and are sandwiched between, perimeter  448  of sheet  440  and upstream edge  434  of liner  427 . Upstream edge  434  is typically circular. \\n     Downstream edge  436  of liner  427  is stitched to valve body  32  of frame  30 . Typically, downstream edge  436  is shaped and positioned to approximately conform to rings  182  and  184 , and is stitched to these rings. \\n     It is to be noted that throughout this patent application (including the specification and the claims) stitching of a perimeter or edge of a sheet to a perimeter or edge of another sheet, does not necessarily mean that the sheets are stitched at their absolute edges (i.e., their free edges). Rather, in this context, the \u201cperimeter\u201d or \u201cedge\u201d also includes the adjacent area of the sheet, as is understood by one of ordinary skill in the stitching art, and as is typically required for effective stitching. \\n     Valvular assembly  430  is typically positioned within frame assembly such that the apex of curved edge  456  of each leaflet  58  is disposed axially close to (e.g., axially within 2 mm of, e.g., within 1 mm of) an upstream end  34  of valve body  32 . Valvular assembly  430  is also typically positioned within frame assembly such that free edge  458  of each leaflet  58  is disposed downstream of leg  50 . \\n     Subsequently, sheet  450  is attached to frame assembly  222  ( FIGS. 15A-C ). Outer perimeter  454  of sheet  450  is stitched to greater perimeter  446  of the sheet  440  ( FIG. 15A ). This is represented by stitch line  455 . Typically, perimeter  454  is larger than perimeter  446 , and is brought inwards to be stitched to perimeter  446  (e.g., making sheet  450  frustoconical), with inner perimeter  452  disposed axially away from frame assembly  222  (e.g., further axially away than outer perimeter  454  from the frame assembly). \\n     Subsequently, sheet  450  is everted by bringing inner perimeter  452  toward frame assembly  222 , and passing the inner perimeter around the tips of arms  46 \u2014i.e., axially past the tips of all of the arms ( FIG. 15B ). Typically, and as shown, arms  46  collectively define an arm-span d 23  that is wider than perimeter  452 . That is, the tips of arms  46  typically define a perimeter that is greater than perimeter  452 . For some applications, the passage of inner perimeter  452  around the tips of arms  46  is facilitated by bending (e.g., temporarily) one or more of arms  46 . \\n     Inner perimeter  452  is advanced over at least part of valve body  32  toward a downstream end of frame assembly  222 , and is stitched in place. Typically, perimeter  452  is advanced between the valve body and legs  50 , such that perimeter  452  circumscribes valve body  32 , and legs  50  are disposed radially outside of sheet  450 . As described hereinabove, each leg  50  extends radially outward and in an upstream direction from a respective leg-base  66  to a respective leg-tip  68 . Each leg therefore extends at an acute angle to define a respective cleft  250  between the leg and valve body  32  (e.g., the tubular portion), the cleft open to the upstream direction. Typically, perimeter  452  is tucked into clefts  250 , and is stitched into place. Frame assembly  222  defines a distance d 22 , measured along a straight line, between the ends of arms  46  and clefts  250 . For clarity, distance d 22  may be defined as a distance between (i) an imaginary ring described by the ends of arms  46 , and (ii) an imaginary ring described by clefts  250 . \\n     The dimensions and positioning of sheet  450  defines an inflatable pouch  490  that is bounded by sheet  450  (e.g., defining an outer and/or downstream wall of the pouch), sheet  440  (e.g., defining an upstream wall of the pouch), and liner  427  (e.g., defining an inner wall of the pouch). Pouch  490  typically circumscribes the longitudinal axis of the implant and/or the valve body of frame assembly  222  (e.g., the pouch is a cuff), and further typically extends radially outward from the valve body. Typically, an upstream portion of pouch  490  is attached to valve frame  30  (e.g., and is not attached to outer frame  60 ), and a downstream portion of the pouch is attached to the outer frame. As described in more detail hereinbelow, at least one respective window  482  into pouch  490  is defined between each leaflet  58  and perimeter  452 . \\n       FIGS. 16A-C  show steps in dressing frame assembly  222  with sheet  460 , in accordance with some applications of the invention. Each strip  464  is formed into a respective pocket  478  ( FIGS. 16A-B ). Each strip is folded over itself, about a fold-line  463  that is orthogonal to strip-axis ax 2 , thereby forming (i) a first strip-portion  464   a  that extends from belt  462  to the fold-line, and (ii) a second strip-portion  464   b  that extends from fold-line back toward the belt. First strip-portion  464   a  and second strip-portion  464   b  are stitched together at first edge  468   a  and second edge  468   b.  The resulting pocket  478  is typically elongate, and has (i) an opening  470  defined at least in part by end  466  of the strip, and (ii) a tip  472  at the fold-line. \\n     For some applications, a soft pad  476  is provided in each pocket  478 , typically at tip  472 . For some such applications, and as shown in  FIG. 15B , pad  476  is formed from a piece of foam  474  (e.g., comprising polyurethane). Piece of foam  474  may initially be generally cubic. For some applications, and as shown, piece of foam  474  is folded to form a niche  477  in pad  476 , typically after having been at least partly flattened by compression. Pad  476  may be introduced into pocket  478  before the pocket is fully formed (e.g., as shown), or may be subsequently introduced into the pocket via opening  470 . \\n     Alternatively, pads  300  may be used in place of pads  476 , and may be added to flanges  54  as described with reference to  FIGS. 12A-H , mutatis mutandis. \\n     For applications in which pad  476  is used, each strip-portion  464   a  and  464   b  typically defines a widened region  479  adjacent to fold-line  463 , such that when pockets  478  are formed, a receptacle for pad  476  is formed. \\n     Pockets  478  are subsequently slid onto legs  50 , and belt  462  is wrapped around frame assembly  222  downstream of legs  50  (e.g., downstream of the axial level at which the legs are coupled to the valve body). Belt  462  is typically positioned such that it is disposed over the commissures of leaflets  58  and/or over connectors  432 . That is, the belt is typically wrapped around the frame assembly at an axial level such t For applications in which pads  476  are used, flanges  54  of legs  50  are typically advanced into niches  477  of the pads. Belt  462  (e.g., the edge of the belt from which pockets  478  extend) is stitched to sheet  450 . More specifically, the upstream edge of belt  462  is stitched circumferentially to perimeter  452  of sheet  450 . This is represented by a stitch line  465 . Therefore, once implant  420  is assembled, the edge of belt  462  from which pockets  478  extend is an upstream edge of the belt, while the edge that is closest to the downstream end of the implant is a downstream edge of the belt. Legs  50 , within pockets  478 , extend radially outward from between belt  462  and sheet  450  (e.g., at stitch line  465 ). \\n     For some applications, tips  472  and/or pads  476  are further secured to flanges  54  by stitching  475 , which may pass through a hole  55  (labeled in  FIG. 1A ) defined in each flange  54 . Stitching  475  is visible in  FIGS. 18A-C . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 16C , for some applications, polytetrafluoroethylene ring  78  is typically also attached to frame assembly  222 . For some such applications, in addition to being stitched to frame assembly  222 , ring  78  is also stitched to belt  462  (e.g., to the edge of the belt opposite pockets  478 \u2014i.e., the downstream edge of the belt). \\n       FIG. 17  shows a ribbon  480  being wrapped around the leg-base  66  of each leg  50 , in accordance with some applications of the invention. For some applications, the ends of ribbon  480  overlap. Ribbons  480  are stitched in place, but the stitches are typically not disposed in cleft  250 . As shown, ribbons  480  may be stitched to belt  462 . Although ribbons  480  are shown being used in combination with pockets  478  (and are therefore wrapped around the pockets at leg-base  66 ), it is to be noted that ribbons  480  may alternatively be used for applications in which legs  50  are generally uncovered. Ribbon  480  covers cleft  250 , and is hypothesized by the inventors to reduce a likelihood of tissue (e.g., leaflet or chordae tissue) from becoming wedged in and/or damaged by the cleft. \\n       FIGS. 18A-C  show implant  420  after its assembly.  FIG. 18A  is an upper perspective view (e.g., showing upstream surfaces of the implant),  FIG. 18B  shows a side view, and  FIG. 18C  shows a lower perspective view (e.g., showing downstream surfaces of the implant). \\n     As described with reference to  FIGS. 3E-F , implant  20  (which comprises frame assembly  22 ) is secured in place at the native valve by sandwiching tissue of the native valve between the implant&#39;s upstream support portion  40  and flanges  54 . Implants that comprise frame assembly  222 , such as implant  220 , are typically secured in the same way, mutatis mutandis. Implants that further comprise pouch  490 , such as implant  420 , are typically secured similarly, but with pouch  490  disposed between the upstream support portion and the tissue of the native valve. Therefore in at least some regions of implant  420 , the tissue of the native valve is sandwiched between flanges  54  and pouch  490 , e.g., as shown in  FIG. 19 . \\n     Windows  482  open into pouch  490  from the lumen of the valve body. Once implant  420  has been implanted at the native valve, windows  482  are disposed functionally within ventricle  8 , whereas at least portions of pouch  490  are disposed functionally within atrium  6 . Therefore, during ventricular systole, ventricular pressure (which is much greater than atrial pressure) forces blood into pouch  490 , thereby inflating the pouch. This inflation presses pouch  490  against the tissue of the native valve. It is hypothesized by the inventors that this inhibits paravalvular leakage of blood, especially during ventricular systole. For example, the pouch may seal a paravalvular gap at the commissures of the native valve. For some applications, inflation of pouch  490  squeezes tissue of the native valve (e.g., native leaflets) between the pouch and flanges  54 . Pouch  490  is typically dimensioned such that if, in a particular region, tissue is not disposed between a flange  54  and pouch  490 , inflation of the pouch presses the pouch against the flange. \\n     There is therefore provided, in accordance with an application of the present invention, apparatus, comprising:\\n         a frame assembly (e.g., frame assembly  222 ) that comprises: (i) a valve body that circumscribes a longitudinal axis and defines a lumen along the axis; (ii) a plurality of arms (e.g., arms  46 ) that are coupled to the valve body at a first axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis (e.g., defined by sites  35 ), each of the arms extending radially outward from the valve body to a respective arm-tip; and (iii) a plurality of ventricular legs (e.g., legs  50 ) that (a) are coupled to the valve body at a second axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis (e.g., defined by coupling points  52 ), the second axial level being downstream of the first axial level, and that (b) extend radially outward from the valve body and toward the plurality of arms;   a tubular liner (e.g., liner  427 ) that lines the lumen, and that has an upstream end and a downstream end;   a plurality of prosthetic leaflets (e.g., leaflets  58 ), disposed within the lumen, attached to the liner, and arranged to facilitate one-way upstream-to-downstream fluid flow through the lumen;   a first sheet of flexible material (e.g., sheet  440 ), the first sheet having (i) a greater perimeter, and (ii) a smaller perimeter that defines an opening, the first sheet being attached to the plurality of arms with the opening aligned with the lumen of the valve body; and   a second sheet of flexible material (e.g., sheet  450 ):\\n           the second sheet having a first perimeter and a second perimeter,   the first perimeter being attached to the greater perimeter of the first sheet around the greater perimeter of the first sheet,   the second sheet extending from the first perimeter radially inwards and downstream toward the second perimeter, the second perimeter circumscribing, and attached to, the valve body at a third axial level that is downstream of the first axial level.   \\n               \\n\\n     The first sheet, the second sheet, and the liner define inflatable pouch  490  therebetween, the first sheet defining an upstream wall of the pouch, the second sheet defining a radially-outer wall of the pouch, and the liner defining a radially-inner wall of the pouch. The apparatus defines a plurality of windows (e.g., windows  482 ) from the lumen into the pouch, each of the windows bounded by the liner at upstream edges of the window, and bounded by the second perimeter and/or belt  462  at a downstream edge of the window. Each window  482  is typically discrete\u2014i.e., bounded on all sides, and separate from other windows. For some applications in which downstream edge  436  of liner  427  is stitched to ring  182  of frame  230 , the most upstream parts of windows  482  are closer to the upstream end of the implant than are the most downstream parts of arms  46   \\n     Typically, and as shown, pouch  490  circumscribes the valve body of implant  420 . \\n     Typically, and as shown in  FIG. 18C , each window  482  spans more than one cell of the valve body. This is represented by the multiple instances of reference numeral  482  in  FIG. 18C . For some applications, and as shown, each window spans at least partly of five cells of the valve body. For some such applications, and as shown, each window spans substantially all of two cells (e.g., two cells of row  29   a ) and about half (e.g., 40-60 percent) of each of three cells (e.g., three cells of row  29   b ). Each window  482  is bounded by liner  427  at an upstream edge of the window. Typically, and as shown, the upstream edge of each window  482  is defined at rings  182  and  184  of valve frame  230 , at which region  428  of liner  427  is stitched to the valve frame. At the downstream edge of each window, the window is bounded by perimeter  452 , and also by belt  462 . Therefore, at the downstream edge of each window  482 , the window may be considered to be bounded by stitch line  465 . \\n     For some applications, the upstream edge of each window  482  is the shape of a capital letter M, e.g., with the apices of the letter M at upstream end  34  of the valve body, and with the vertex of the letter M at a site  35 . Because region  428  of liner  427  follows, and is stitched to, the joists of valve frame  230  at region  428  of the liner, it is hypothesized by the inventors that this arrangement reinforces the upstream edge of window  482 , e.g., increasing durability compared to an arrangement in which the upstream edge of the window crosses between joists of the valve frame. \\n     As described hereinabove, sheet  440  typically covers an upstream side of arms  46 . Once pouch  490  has been formed, at least most of each arm  46  is therefore disposed inside the pouch. As also described hereinabove, sheet  440  is stitched to arms  46 . Once pouch  490  has been formed, the pouch (i.e., the part of the pouch defined by sheet  440 ) is therefore stitched to arms  46 , \\n     For some applications, a circumferential stitch line  445  is used to stitch sheet  440  to sheet  450  at a radius smaller than the overall radius of upstream support portion  40  (i.e., radially inward from the tips of arms  46 ), typically sandwiching arms  46  between these two sheets. Stitch line  445  is typically radially aligned with region  154  and/or wide (and flexible) portion  46   c  of arm  46 . This typically creates a region  484  in which the portions of sheets  440  and  450  that are disposed radially outward from stitch line  445  are isolated from pouch  490 . For such applications, the ends of arms  46  are therefore typically disposed in region  484 , and are isolated from pouch  490 . \\n     For some applications, and as shown, sheet  450  is sufficiently baggy that the sheet (e.g., pouch  490 ) may extend radially outward beyond arms  46 , particularly if uninhibited by tissue of the native valve. This may be achieved by radial dimension d 21  of sheet  450  being greater than distance d 22  between the ends arms  46  and clefts  250 . For some applications, dimension d 21  is more than 30 percent greater (e.g., more than 50 percent greater) than distance d 22 . For example, dimension d 21  may be 30-100 percent greater (e.g., 30-80 percent greater, e.g., 40-80 percent greater, such as 50-70 percent greater) than distance d 22 . As shown, pouch  490  may extend radially outward beyond arms  46  irrespective of the presence of stitch line  445 , which is disposed radially-inward from the ends of arms  46 . \\n     Regarding the axial position (i.e., the position along the longitudinal axis of implant  420 ) of pouch  490  and windows  482 . For some applications, pouch  490  extends, with respect to the longitudinal axis of implant  420 , further upstream than the leaflets. That is, for some applications, upstream regions of pouch  490  (e.g., those closest to prosthetic valve support  40 ) are situated further upstream than even the apex of curved edge  456  of leaflets  58 . For some applications, and as shown, each of leaflets  58  is attached to liner  427  upstream of windows  482 . That is, at least the apex of curved edge  456  of leaflets  58  is disposed upstream of windows  482 . Free edge  458  of each leaflet  58  is typically disposed downstream of the third axial level\u2014i.e., the axial level at which perimeter  452  of sheet  450  is attached to frame assembly  222 . That is, leaflets  58  typically extend further downstream than pouch  490 . For some applications, and as shown, the third axial level (i.e., the axial level at which perimeter  452  of sheet  450  is attached to frame assembly  222 ) is upstream of the second axial level (i.e., the axial level at which legs  50  are attached to the valve body). \\n     It is to be noted that, whereas liner  427  is disposed on the inside of valve body  32 , sheet  450  and belt  462  are disposed on the outside of the valve body. Axially downstream of windows  482 , valve body  32  is typically not lined\u2014i.e., no liner is typically disposed between leaflets  58  and frame  30 . However, belt  462  circumscribes valve body  32  and serves a similar function to a liner\u2014channeling fluid through the lumen of the valve body. \\n     It is to be noted that projections  246  are not visible in  FIG. 18B . For some applications, and as shown, the projection-length of projections  246  (e.g., see projection-length d 13  in  FIG. 5C ) is such that the projections do not extend further upstream than the tips of arms  46 . For some applications, and as shown, projections  246  extend further upstream than the highest part of arms  46  within concave region  152 . For some applications, and as shown, projections  246  extend to an axial height that is between (a) that of the tips of arms  46 , and (b) that of the highest part of arms  46  within concave region  152 . This is illustrated perhaps most clearly in  FIG. 9A , which shows inner frame  330   a,  but is applicable to each of the inner frames described herein, mutatis mutandis. \\n     Reference is made to  FIGS. 20, and 21A -C, which are schematic illustrations of implant  420 , in accordance with some applications of the invention. Pouch  490  defines an interior space  500 . For some applications, and as shown, arms  46  and legs  50  (e.g., flanges  54  thereof) narrow pouch  490  therebetween to form a narrowed portion  510  of the pouch. Narrowed portion  510  typically circumscribes valve body  32  and/or the longitudinal axis of the implant\u2014e.g., the narrowed portion being annular. This thereby defines (i) an inner portion  502  of the interior space, radially inward from narrowed portion  510 , and in fluid communication with lumen  38  of the implant (e.g., via windows  482 ), and (ii) an outer portion  504  of the interior space, radially outward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with inner portion  502  via the narrowed portion. At narrowed portion  510  each leg  50  (e.g., flange  54  thereof) typically pushes sheet  450  (which defines a downstream surface of pouch  490 ) toward sheet  440  (which defines an upstream surface of the pouch), such as pressing sheet  450  into contact with sheet  440 . \\n     Typically, and as shown, arms  46  and legs  50  alternate circumferentially. That is, when viewed from above, an arm  46  is disposed circumferentially on either side of each leg  50 , and a leg is disposed circumferentially on either side of each arm. This is illustrated for implant  22  in  FIG. 1D , mutatis mutandis. For applications in which arms  46  and legs  50  alternate circumferentially, at narrowed portion  510  each leg  50  (e.g., flange  54  thereof) forms a respective bulge  506  in sheet  440  (i.e., the upstream surface of pouch  490 ) by pressing sheet  450  (i.e., the downstream surface of the pouch) against the upstream surface (see  FIG. 18A ). Bulges  506  are therefore disposed circumferentially between arms  46 . It is typically the tip of each leg  50  that presses into sheet  450 , and therefore bulges  506  are typically compact (e.g., as opposed to being elongate). \\n     It is to be noted that narrowed portion  510  is therefore formed without pouch  490  being sandwiched directly between arms  46  and legs  50 . It is also to be noted that, at narrowed portion  510 , pouch  490  is stitched to arms  46  but not to legs  50 . For some applications, at narrowed portion  510 , legs  50  extend in an upstream direction past arms  46 . (This can be understood from  FIG. 1C , mutatis mutandis). For some applications, this configuration results in sheet  450  billowing between legs  50 , e.g., as indicated by reference numeral  508  in  FIG. 18C . \\n     It is to be noted that the configuration described hereinabove exists in implant  420  even prior to implantation\u2014i.e., even in the absence of tissue captured between arms  46  and flanges  54 . \\n     For some applications of the invention, narrowed portion  510  impedes fluid communication between outer portion  504  and inner portion  502  (and thereby between the outer portion and the lumen of the implant). It is hypothesized by the inventors that, for some such applications, this advantageously inhibits blood that has entered outer portion  504 , from exiting the outer portion. During ventricular systole, ventricular pressure forces blood through windows  482  into pouch  490  (i.e., inner portion  502  thereof). At least some of this blood typically enters outer portion  504 , e.g., due to the relatively high ventricular pressure. It is hypothesized by the inventors that, at least in part due to narrowed portion  510 , during ventricular diastole, pressure in the opposite direction is insufficient to force as much blood back out of outer portion  504 . It is further hypothesized by the inventors that, for some applications, this results in a net increase in the volume of blood within outer portion  504  during each cardiac cycle, e.g., until resistance inhibits further inflation of outer portion  504 . This is illustrated by the sequence of frames A-F in  FIG. 20 , which represent the state of implant  420  over time.  FIG. 20  shows blood  14  entering outer portion  504  only after inner portion  502  has become substantially filled (frames C-D), but for some applications blood may begin to enter outer portion  504  earlier. \\n     It is hypothesized by the inventors that such a configuration of pouch  490  further improves paravalvular sealing provided by the pouch. It is further hypothesized by the inventors that, for some applications of the invention, such a configuration of pouch  490  facilitates the pouch (e.g., outer portion  504  thereof) conforming to the tissue surrounding implant  420 , and therefore further facilitating sealing. For example,  FIGS. 21A-C  show implant  420  disposed at native valve  10 , when the anatomy of the native valve (e.g., the annulus and/or leaflets) are uneven with respect to the implant. For example, the anatomy itself may be particularly uneven, or the implant may have been implanted at a sub-optimal angle with respect to the anatomy. In the example shown, at a zone  520   a  the anatomy is relatively close to upstream support portion  40 , whereas at a zone  520   b,  the anatomy is relatively spaced apart from the upstream support portion, e.g., resulting in a gap  522  ( FIG. 21A ). Over time (e.g., between ten seconds and one hour), outer portion  504  fills, in each zone, according to the mechanical constraints of that region ( FIGS. 21B-C ). In the example shown, in zone  520   a  outer portion  504  inflates with blood until space between upstream support portion  40  and the anatomy (e.g., annulus or leaflet tissue) is filled, and the anatomy resists further inflation of the outer portion ( FIG. 21B ). In zone  520   b  outer portion  504  continues to inflate with blood because, in this zone, the space between the upstream support portion and the anatomy is larger ( FIG. 21C ). In this way, it is hypothesized by the inventors that implant  420  advantageously adapts to the native anatomy, providing improved paravalvular sealing. \\n     For some applications, at least one coagulation component  530  is disposed within outer portion  504 , and is configured to promote blood coagulation within the outer portion. For some applications, coagulation component  530  is annular and, within outer portion  504 , circumscribes the longitudinal axis of the implant. For some applications, coagulation component  530  comprises a fabric (e.g., comprising polyethylene terephthalate). For some applications, coagulation component  530  comprises polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), e.g., in the form of a membrane or ribbon. For some applications, coagulation component  530  comprises a metallic (e.g., nitinol or stainless steel) wire, membrane, or mesh, covered by a fabric or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. For applications, coagulation component comprises a coagulation-inducing drug coated thereon or embedded therein (e.g., within a fabric). For some applications, coagulation component  530  comprises pericardial tissue (e.g., bovine or porcine). \\n     For some applications of the invention, the scope of the invention includes using one or more of the apparatus and techniques described in this patent application in combination with one or more of the apparatus and techniques described in one or more of the following documents, each of which is incorporated herein by reference:\\n         U.S. patent application Ser.

Regurgitation of blood from the ventricle into the atrium results in increased total stroke volume and decreased cardiac output, and ultimate weakening of the ventricle secondary to a volume overload and a pressure overload of the atrium.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0009\">For some applications, an implant is provided having a valve body that defines a lumen, an upstream support portion, and a plurality of legs. The implant is percutaneously deliverable to a native heart valve in a compressed state, and is expandable at the native valve. The implant comprises an inner frame and an outer frame. Typically, the upstream support portion is at least partly defined by the inner frame, and the legs are at least partly defined by the outer frame. The implant is secured at the native valve by sandwiching tissue of the native valve between the upstream support portion and the legs. For some applications, a flexible pouch extends radially outward from the valve body. For some such applications, the arms and the legs narrow the pouch therebetween to form a narrowed portion of the pouch, thereby dividing an interior space of the pouch into (a) an inner portion, radially inward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the lumen, and (b) an outer portion, radially outward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with the inner portion via the narrowed portion.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0010\">There is therefore provided, in accordance with an application of the present invention, apparatus, including:</p>\\n    <p

<p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0080\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A-E</figref> and <b>2</b>, which are schematic illustrations of an implant <b>20</b> and a frame assembly <b>22</b> of the implant, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Implant <b>20</b> serves as a prosthetic valve for use at a native heart valve of a subject\u2014typically the mitral valve. Implant <b>20</b> has a compressed state for minimally-invasive (typically transluminal, e.g., transfemoral) delivery, and an expanded state into which the implant is transitioned at the native heart valve, and in which the implant provides prosthetic valve functionality. Implant <b>20</b> comprises frame assembly <b>22</b>, flexible sheeting <b>23</b>, and a valve member such as prosthetic leaflets <b>58</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0081\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A-E</figref> show implant <b>20</b> and frame assembly <b>22</b> in the expanded state. For clarity, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> show frame assembly <b>22</b> alone. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an isometric exploded view of frame assembly <b>22</b>, and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a side exploded view of the frame assembly. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref> are side- and top-views, respectively, of frame assembly <b>22</b>, assembled. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1E</figref> is a perspective view of implant <b>20</b>, including sheeting <b>23</b> and leaflets <b>58</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0082\">Implant <b>20</b> has an upstream end <b>24</b>, a downstream end <b>26</b>, and defines a central longitudinal axis ax<b>1</b> therebetween. Frame assembly <b>22</b> comprises a valve frame <b>30</b> that comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion) <b>32</b> that has an upstream end <b>34</b> and a downstream end <b>36</b>, and is shaped to define a lumen <b>38</b> through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve body <b>32</b> circumscribes axis ax<b>1</b>, and thereby defines lumen <b>38</b> along the axis. Throughout this application, including the specification and the claims, unless stated otherwise, \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream,\u201d e.g., with respect to the ends of implant <b>20</b>, are defined with respect to the longitudinal axis of implant <b>20</b>, by the orientation and functioning of leaflets <b>58</b>, which facilitate one-way upstream-to-downstream fluid flow through lumen <b>38</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0083\">Valve frame <b>30</b> further comprises a plurality of arms <b>46</b>, each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body <b>32</b>. In this context, the term \u201cextends radially outward\u201d is not limited to extending in a straight line that is orthogonal to axis ax<b>1</b>, but rather, and as shown for arms <b>46</b>, includes extending away from axis ax<b>1</b> while curving in an upstream and/or downstream direction. Typically, and as shown, each arm <b>46</b> extends from valve body <b>32</b> in an upstream direction, and curves radially outward. That is, the portion of arm <b>46</b> closest to valve body <b>32</b> extends primarily upstream away from the valve body (e.g., extending radially outward only a little, extending not at all radially outward, or even extending radially inward a little), and the arm then curves to extend radially outward. The curvature of arms <b>46</b> is described in more detail hereinbelow.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0084\">Valve body <b>32</b> is defined by a repeating pattern of cells that extends around central longitudinal axis ax<b>1</b>. In the expanded state of each tubular portion, these cells are typically narrower at their upstream and downstream extremities than midway between these extremities. For example, and as shown, the cells may be roughly diamond or astroid in shape. Typically, and as shown, valve body <b>32</b> is defined by two stacked, tessellated rows of cells\u2014an upstream row <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of first-row cells, and a downstream row <b>29</b> <i>b </i>of second-row cells. Frame <b>30</b> is typically made by cutting (e.g., laser-cutting) its basic (i.e., raw) structure from a tube of, for example, Nitinol (followed by re-shaping and heat treating to form its shape-set structure). Although valve body <b>32</b> is therefore typically monolithic, because the resulting cellular structure of valve body <b>32</b> resembles an open lattice, it may be useful to describe it as defining a plurality of joists <b>28</b> that connect at nodes <b>100</b> to form the cellular structure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0085\">Typically, and as shown, each arm <b>46</b> is attached to and extends from a site <b>35</b> that is at the connection between two adjacent cells of upstream row <b>29</b> <i>a. </i>That is, site <b>35</b> is a connection node between first-row cells. The tessellation between rows <b>29</b> <i>a </i>and <b>29</b> <i>b </i>is such that site <b>35</b> may alternatively be described as the upstream extremity of cells of downstream row <b>29</b> <i>b. </i>That is, the upstream extremity of each second-row cell is coincident with a respective connection node between first-row cells. Site <b>35</b> is therefore a node <b>100</b> that connects four joists <b>28</b>. Upstream end <b>34</b> of valve body <b>32</b> may be described as defining alternating peaks and troughs, and sites <b>35</b> are downstream of the peaks (e.g., at the troughs).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0086\">It is hypothesized by the inventors that connecting arm <b>46</b> to valve body <b>32</b> at site <b>35</b> (instead of at upstream end <b>34</b>) maintains the length of the lumen of the tubular portion, but also advantageously reduces the distance that the tubular portion extends into the ventricle of the subject, and thereby reduces a likelihood of inhibiting blood flow out of the ventricle through the left ventricular outflow tract. It is further hypothesized by the inventors that because each site <b>35</b> is a node <b>100</b> that connects four joists (whereas each node <b>100</b> that is at upstream end <b>34</b> connects only two joists), sites <b>35</b> are more rigid, and therefore connecting arms <b>46</b> to valve body <b>32</b> at sites <b>35</b> provides greater rigidity to each arm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0087\">Sheeting <b>23</b> may comprise one or more individual sheets, which may or may not be connected to each other. The individual sheets may comprise the same or different materials. Typically, sheeting <b>23</b> comprises a fabric, e.g., comprising a polyester, such as polyethylene terephthalate. Arms <b>46</b> are typically covered with sheeting <b>23</b>. Typically, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1E</figref>, an annular sheet <b>25</b> of sheeting <b>23</b> is disposed over arms <b>46</b>, extending between the arms, e.g., so as to reduce a likelihood of paravalvular leakage. For some such applications, excess sheeting <b>23</b> is provided between arms <b>46</b>, so as to facilitate movement of arms <b>46</b> independently of each other. Annular sheet <b>25</b> typically covers the upstream side of arms <b>46</b>, but may alternatively or additionally cover the downstream side of the arms.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0088\">Alternatively, each arm <b>46</b> may be individually covered in a sleeve of sheeting <b>23</b>, thereby facilitating independent movement of the arms.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0089\">Arms <b>46</b>, and typically the sheeting that covers the arms, define an upstream support portion <b>40</b> of implant <b>20</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0090\">Other surfaces of frame assembly <b>22</b> may also be covered with sheeting <b>23</b>. Typically, sheeting <b>23</b> covers at least part of valve body <b>32</b>, e.g., defining a liner <b>27</b> that lines an inner surface of the valve body, and thereby defining lumen <b>38</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0091\">Support <b>40</b> has an upstream surface, and a downstream surface. Each arm <b>46</b> is typically curved such that a downstream surface of support <b>40</b> defines an annular concave region <b>152</b>, and an annular convex region <b>154</b> radially outward from the concave region. That is, in region <b>152</b> the downstream surface of support <b>40</b> (e.g., the downstream surface of each arm <b>46</b> thereof) is concave, and in region <b>154</b> the downstream surface of the support is convex.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0092\">Concave region <b>152</b> extends radially between a concave-region inner radius r<b>1</b> and a concave-region outer radius r<b>2</b>. Convex region <b>154</b> extends radially between a convex-region inner radius r<b>3</b> and a concave-region outer radius r<b>4</b>. It is to be noted that in this context (including the specification and the claims), the term \u201cradius\u201d means a radial distance from axis ax<b>1</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0093\">For some applications, and as shown, each arm <b>46</b> has a serpentine shape, such that there is no discernable gap between concave region <b>152</b> and convex region <b>154</b>. For such applications, each arm <b>46</b> has an inflection point where region <b>152</b> transitions into region <b>154</b>. For such applications, radius r<b>2</b> and radius r<b>3</b> are coincident, and collectively define an inflection radius at which the inflection point of each arm lies.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0094\">For some applications, radius r<b>1</b> is the radius of tubular portion <b>32</b>. For some applications, there is a discernable gap between regions <b>152</b> and <b>154</b>. For example, each arm may be curved in regions <b>152</b> and <b>154</b>, but have a straight portion between these regions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0095\">Although regions <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> may be locally defined with respect to one or more particular arms <b>46</b>, these regions typically completely circumscribe axis ax<b>1</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0096\">Frame assembly <b>22</b> further comprises a plurality of legs <b>50</b>, each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward and in an upstream direction from a respective leg-base <b>66</b> to a respective leg-tip <b>68</b>. Each leg <b>50</b> defines a tissue-engaging flange <b>54</b>, which is typically the most radially outward part of the leg, and includes leg-tip <b>68</b>. Typically, legs <b>50</b> are defined by an outer frame (or \u201cleg frame\u201d) <b>60</b> that circumscribes and is coupled to valve frame <b>30</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0097\">Frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> define respective coupling elements <b>31</b> and <b>61</b>, which are fixed with respect to each other at coupling points <b>52</b>. For some applications, frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> are attached to each other only at coupling points <b>52</b>. Although frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> are attached to each other at coupling points <b>52</b>, radial forces may provide further coupling between the frames, e.g., frame <b>30</b> pressing radially outward against frame <b>60</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0098\">Typically, coupling points <b>52</b> are circumferentially aligned with legs <b>50</b> (and flanges <b>54</b> thereof), but circumferentially offset with respect to arms <b>46</b>. That is, the coupling points are typically at the same rotational position around axis ax<b>1</b> as the legs, but are rotationally staggered with respect to the rotational position of the arms.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0099\">Coupling points <b>52</b> are typically disposed circumferentially around frame assembly <b>22</b> on a transverse plane that is orthogonal to axis ax<b>1</b>. That is, coupling points <b>52</b> are typically all disposed at the same longitudinal position along axis ax<b>1</b>. Typically, coupling points <b>52</b> are disposed longitudinally between upstream end <b>24</b> and downstream end <b>26</b> of frame assembly <b>22</b>, but not at either of these ends. Further typically, coupling points <b>52</b> are disposed longitudinally between upstream end <b>34</b> and downstream end <b>36</b> of tubular portion <b>32</b>, but not at either of these ends. As shown, tubular portion <b>32</b> is typically barrel-shaped\u2014i.e., slightly wider in the middle than at either end. For some applications, and as shown, coupling points <b>52</b> are disposed slightly downstream of the widest part of tubular portion <b>32</b>. For example, coupling points <b>52</b> may be 0.5-3 mm downstream of the widest part of tubular portion <b>32</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the longitudinal distance between the widest part of tubular portion <b>32</b> and coupling points <b>52</b> may be 20-50 percent (e.g., 20-40 percent) of the longitudinal distance between the widest part of the tubular portion and downstream end <b>36</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0100\">Coupling elements <b>31</b> are typically defined by (or at least directly attached to) legs <b>50</b>. Therefore legs <b>50</b> are fixedly attached to frame <b>30</b> at coupling points <b>52</b>. Despite the fixed attachment of legs <b>50</b> to frame <b>30</b>, frame <b>60</b> comprises a plurality of struts <b>70</b> that extend between, and connect, adjacent legs. Struts <b>70</b> are typically arranged in one or more rings <b>72</b>, e.g., a first (e.g., upstream) ring <b>74</b> and a second (e.g., downstream) ring <b>76</b>. For some applications, and as shown, frame <b>60</b> comprises exactly two rings <b>72</b>. Each ring is defined by a pattern of alternating peaks <b>64</b> and troughs <b>62</b>, the peaks being further upstream than the troughs. Each ring is typically coupled to legs <b>50</b> at troughs <b>62</b>\u2014i.e., such that peaks <b>64</b> are disposed circumferentially between the legs. Peaks <b>64</b> are therefore typically circumferentially aligned with arms <b>46</b>. That is, peaks <b>64</b> are typically at the same rotational position around axis ax<b>1</b> as arms <b>46</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0101\">The elongate element of frame <b>60</b> that defines leg <b>50</b> continues in a downstream direction past ring <b>74</b> and coupling element <b>61</b>, and couples ring <b>74</b> to ring <b>76</b>. However, throughout this patent application, leg <b>50</b> itself is defined as the free portion of this elongate element that extends from ring <b>74</b>. Leg-base <b>66</b> may be defined as the region of leg <b>50</b> that is coupled to the remainder of frame <b>60</b> (e.g., to ring <b>74</b>). Because each leg <b>50</b> extends in a generally upstream direction, leg-base <b>66</b> may also be defined as the most downstream region of leg <b>50</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0102\">In the expanded state, the leg-tip <b>68</b> of each leg is typically disposed radially between radius r<b>3</b> and radius r<b>4</b>. That is, the leg-tip <b>68</b> of each leg is aligned with convex region <b>154</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0103\">Frame <b>60</b> is typically cut from a single tube, e.g., of Nitinol. Therefore, the radial thickness of the frame is typically consistent throughout\u2014e.g., it is the wall thickness of the tube from which it was cut. However, the circumferential width of components of frame <b>60</b> (i.e., the width of the component measured around the circumference of the frame) may differ. For example, for some applications, a circumferential thickness W<b>2</b> of legs <b>50</b> may be at least three times greater than a circumferential thickness W<b>1</b> of struts <b>70</b>. Greater circumferential thickness typically provides the component with greater rigidity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0104\">Valve frame <b>30</b> and outer frame <b>60</b> are typically each cut from respective metallic tubes, e.g., of Nitinol. This is typically the case for each of the implants described herein. More specifically, for each of the implants described herein:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0014-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0015-0001\" num=\"0105\">(1) the valve frame is typically cut from a metallic tube to form a raw valve-frame structure in which the arms and the projections extend axially from the valve body, and the raw valve-frame structure is subsequently shape-set to form a shape-set valve-frame structure in which (i) the valve body is wider than in the raw valve-frame structure, and (ii) the arms extend radially outward from the valve body; and</li> <li id=\"ul0015-0002\" num=\"0106\">(2) the outer frame is typically cut from a metallic tube to form a raw outer-frame structure in which the legs (including the flanges) extend axially, and the raw outer-frame structure is subsequently shape-set to form a shape-set outer-frame structure in which (i) the rings are wider than in the raw outer-frame structure, and (ii) the flanges extend radially outward from the rings.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0107\">Prosthetic leaflets <b>58</b> are disposed within lumen <b>38</b>, and are configured to facilitate one-way liquid flow through the lumen from upstream end <b>34</b> to downstream end <b>36</b>. Leaflets <b>58</b> thereby define the orientation of the upstream and downstream ends of valve body <b>32</b>, and of implant <b>20</b> in general.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0108\">Typically, implant <b>20</b> is biased (e.g., shape-set) to assume its expanded state. For example, frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> may be constructed from a shape-memory metal such as Nitinol or a shape-memory polymer. Transitioning of implant <b>20</b> between the respective states is typically controlled by delivery apparatus, such as by constraining the implant in a compressed state within a capsule and/or against a control rod, and selectively releasing portions of the implant to allow them to expand.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0109\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> shows implant <b>20</b> in its compressed state, for delivery to the heart of the subject, e.g., within a capsule <b>170</b> or delivery tube. Capsule <b>90</b> may be a capsule or a catheter. For clarity, only frame assembly <b>22</b> of implant <b>20</b> is shown. In the compressed state, arms <b>46</b> define a ball <b>48</b> at an end of valve body <b>32</b>. It is to be noted that in this context, the term \u201cball\u201d (including the specification and the claims) means a substantially bulbous element. The ball may be substantially spherical, spheroid, ovoid, or another bulbous shape.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0110\">In the compressed state, frame assembly <b>22</b> defines a waist <b>56</b> (i.e., is waisted) at a longitudinal site between the valve body and the ball. For some applications, and as shown, waist <b>56</b> is longitudinally upstream of frame <b>60</b>, and is therefore primarily defined by valve frame <b>30</b>. However, for some such applications, the downstream limit of the waist may be defined by the upstream limit of frame <b>60</b> (e.g., flanges <b>54</b> thereof).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0111\">It is to be noted that, typically, the bulbous shape of ball <b>48</b> is interrupted at waist <b>56</b>, i.e., where the frame transitions from the ball to the waist. For some applications, and as shown, valve frame <b>30</b> is monolithic (e.g., cut from a single metal tube), and defines both valve body <b>32</b> and arms <b>46</b>. For some applications, and as shown, in the compressed state, the overall shape of valve frame <b>30</b> resembles that of an air rifle pellet or a shuttlecock (e.g., see the cross-section in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>). For some applications, a longitudinal cross-section of frame <b>30</b> has an overall shape that resembles a keyhole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0112\">For some applications, at waist <b>56</b>, frame <b>30</b> (and typically frame assembly <b>22</b> overall) has a transverse diameter d<b>10</b> that is less than 5 mm (e.g., 2-4 mm). For some applications, ball <b>48</b> has a greatest transverse diameter d<b>11</b> of 8-12 mm (e.g., 9-11 mm). For some applications, transverse diameter d<b>10</b> is less than 40 percent (e.g., less than 30 percent, such as 10-30 percent) of transverse diameter d<b>11</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0113\">Due to waist <b>56</b>, while implant <b>20</b> is in its compressed state and disposed within capsule <b>90</b>, the implant and capsule define a toroidal gap <b>57</b> therebetween. Toroidal gap <b>57</b> circumscribes longitudinal axis ax<b>1</b> of the implant around waist <b>56</b>. Therefore, valve body <b>32</b> extends in a first longitudinal direction (i.e., in a generally downstream direction) away from gap <b>57</b>, and arms <b>46</b> extend in a second longitudinal direction (i.e., in a generally upstream direction) away from the gap. For applications in which implant <b>20</b> is delivered to the native valve transfemorally, valve body <b>32</b> is closer to the open end of capsule <b>90</b> than is gap <b>57</b>, and arms <b>46</b> (e.g., ball <b>48</b>) are further from the open end of capsule <b>90</b> than is gap <b>57</b>. For some applications, and as shown, a downstream limit of gap <b>57</b> is defined by the tips of flanges <b>54</b>. For some applications, and as shown, an upstream limit of gap <b>57</b> is defined by the downstream side of arms <b>46</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0114\">It is to be noted that, typically, frame <b>60</b> is disposed only downstream of toroidal gap <b>57</b>, but the frame <b>30</b> is disposed both upstream and downstream of the toroidal gap.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0115\">Reference is again made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1E</figref>. For some applications, implant <b>20</b> comprises a polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., Teflon) ring <b>78</b> attached to downstream end <b>26</b>. Ring <b>78</b> circumscribes lumen <b>38</b> at downstream end <b>36</b> of valve body <b>32</b>, and typically at downstream end <b>26</b> of implant <b>20</b>. Therefore ring <b>78</b> serves as a downstream lip of lumen <b>38</b>. Typically, ring <b>78</b> is attached (e.g., stitched) to both frame <b>30</b> and frame <b>60</b>. For example, ring <b>78</b> may be attached to frame <b>60</b> at troughs <b>62</b>. For some applications, ring <b>78</b> is stitched to downstream end <b>36</b> of valve body <b>32</b> by stiches <b>99</b> that wrap around the ring (i.e., through the opening of the ring and around the outside of the ring) but do not pierce the ring (i.e., the material of the ring).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0116\">Typically, ring <b>78</b> covers downstream end <b>26</b> of the implant (e.g., covers the frames at the downstream end). It is hypothesized by the inventors that ring <b>78</b> advantageously protects tissue (e.g., native leaflets and/or chordae tendineae) from becoming damaged by downstream end <b>26</b> of implant <b>20</b>. There is therefore provided, in accordance with some applications of the invention, apparatus comprising:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0016-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0017-0001\" num=\"0117\">a valve body, having an upstream end and a downstream end, shaped to define a lumen from the upstream end to the downstream end, the lumen defining a longitudinal axis of the prosthetic valve, and the downstream end of the valve body having;</li> <li id=\"ul0017-0002\" num=\"0118\">a fabric liner, lining the lumen;</li> <li id=\"ul0017-0003\" num=\"0119\">a valve member, disposed within the lumen of the valve body; and</li> <li id=\"ul0017-0004\" num=\"0120\">a polytetrafluoroethylene ring coupled to the downstream end of the valve body such that the ring circumscribes the lumen at the downstream end of the valve body.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0121\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-F</figref>, which are schematic illustrations showing the implantation of implant <b>20</b> at a native valve <b>10</b> of a heart <b>4</b> of a subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Valve <b>10</b> is shown as a mitral valve of the subject, disposed between a left atrium <b>6</b> and a left ventricle <b>8</b> of the subject. However, implant <b>20</b> may be implanted at another heart valve of the subject, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, although <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-F</figref> show implant <b>20</b> being delivered transseptally via a sheath <b>88</b>, the implant may alternatively be delivered by any other suitable route, such as transatrially, or transapically.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0122\">Implant <b>20</b> is delivered, in its compressed state, to native valve <b>10</b> using a delivery tool <b>160</b> that is operable from outside the subject (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref>). Tool <b>160</b> typically comprises an extracorporeal controller <b>162</b> (e.g., comprising a handle) at a proximal end of the tool, and a shaft <b>164</b> extending from the controller to a distal portion of the tool. At the distal portion of tool <b>160</b>, the tool typically comprises a capsule <b>170</b> comprising one or more capsule portions <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> (described below), and a mount <b>166</b>. Mount <b>166</b> is coupled (typically fixed) to shaft <b>164</b>. Controller <b>162</b> is operable to control deployment of implant <b>20</b> by transitioning the tool between a delivery state (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref>), an intermediate state (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3E</figref>), and an open state (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3F</figref>). Typically, implant <b>20</b> is delivered within capsule <b>170</b> of tool <b>160</b> in its delivery state, the capsule retaining the implant in the compressed state. Implant <b>20</b> typically comprises one or more appendages <b>80</b> at downstream end <b>26</b>, each appendage typically shaped to define a catch or other bulbous element at the end of the appendage, and to engage mount <b>166</b>, e.g., by becoming disposed within notches in the mount. Appendages <b>80</b> are typically defined by valve frame <b>30</b>, but may alternatively be defined by outer frame <b>60</b>. Capsule <b>170</b> retains appendages <b>80</b> engaged with mount <b>166</b> by retaining implant <b>20</b> (especially downstream end <b>26</b> thereof) in its compressed state. A transseptal approach, such as a transfemoral approach, is shown. At this stage, frame assembly <b>22</b> of implant <b>20</b> is as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0123\">Subsequently, flanges <b>54</b> are deployed\u2014i.e., are allowed to protrude radially outward, e.g., by releasing them from capsule <b>170</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref>). For example, and as shown, capsule <b>170</b> may comprise a distal capsule-portion <b>172</b> and a proximal capsule-portion <b>174</b>, and the distal capsule-portion may be moved distally with respect to implant <b>20</b>, so as to expose flanges <b>54</b> while continuing to restrain upstream end <b>24</b> and downstream end <b>26</b> of implant <b>20</b>. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref>, upstream support portion <b>40</b> (e.g., arms <b>46</b>) is disposed within capsule-portion <b>174</b>, and downstream end <b>36</b> of tubular portion <b>32</b> is disposed within capsule-portion <b>172</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0124\">Typically, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-B</figref>, tool <b>160</b> is positioned such that when flanges <b>54</b> are deployed, they are deployed within atrium <b>6</b> and/or between leaflets <b>12</b> of the subject. Subsequently, the tool is moved downstream (distally, for a transseptal approach) until the leaflets are observed to coapt upstream of flanges <b>54</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>). It is hypothesized by the inventors that this reduces how far into ventricle <b>8</b> the flanges become disposed, and therefore reduces the distance that the deployed flanges must be moved in an upstream direction in order to subsequently engage the leaflets, and therefore reduces the likelihood of inadvertently or prematurely ensnaring tissue such as chordae tendineae. This is described in more detail, mutatis mutandis, in WO 2016/125160 to Hariton et al., filed Feb. 3, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0125\">Alternatively, flanges <b>54</b> may be initially deployed within ventricle <b>8</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0126\">Subsequently, implant <b>20</b> is moved upstream, such that flanges <b>54</b> engage leaflets <b>12</b> of valve <b>10</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3D</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0127\">Subsequently, delivery tool <b>160</b> is transitioned into its intermediate state, thereby allowing implant <b>20</b> to assume a partially-expanded state in which upstream support portion <b>40</b> is expanded, e.g., by releasing the upstream support portion from capsule <b>170</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3E</figref>). For example, and as shown, proximal capsule-portion <b>174</b> may be moved proximally with respect to mount <b>166</b> and/or implant <b>20</b>, so as to expose upstream support portion <b>40</b> (e.g., arms <b>46</b>). Typically, in this state, upstream support portion <b>40</b> has expanded to have a diameter that is at least 80 percent (e.g., at least 90 percent, e.g., at least 95 percent) of its diameter in the expanded state of implant <b>20</b> (e.g., the diameter after implantation is complete), while downstream end <b>26</b> of the implant remains compressed. For some applications, in the partially-expanded state, upstream support portion <b>40</b> has expanded to its fully-expanded diameter. That is, downstream end <b>36</b> of tubular portion <b>32</b> remaining disposed within capsule-portion <b>172</b> typically does not inhibit, by more than 20 percent, if at all, the expansion of upstream support portion <b>40</b>. However, in the partially-expanded state of implant <b>20</b>, legs <b>50</b> are partially inhibited from expanding, such that each leg-tip <b>68</b> is radially aligned with concave region <b>152</b>. That is, each leg-tip <b>68</b> is disposed radially between concave-region inner radius r<b>1</b> and concave-region outer radius r<b>2</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0128\">In the intermediate state, leaflets <b>12</b> of native valve <b>10</b> are sandwiched between upstream support portion <b>40</b> (e.g., annular sheet <b>25</b> thereof) and legs <b>50</b> (e.g., flanges <b>54</b> thereof). It is to be noted that appendages <b>80</b> remain engaged with mount <b>166</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0129\">Subsequently, delivery tool <b>160</b> is transitioned into its open state, thereby allowing implant <b>20</b> to expand toward its expanded state (i.e., such that tubular portion <b>32</b> widens to its fully-expanded state) (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3F</figref>). For example, capsule-portion <b>172</b> may be moved distally with respect to mount <b>166</b> and/or implant <b>20</b>. The resulting expansion of downstream end <b>26</b> of implant <b>20</b> disengages appendages <b>80</b>, and thereby implant <b>20</b> as a whole, from mount <b>166</b>. Appendages <b>80</b> are not visible in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3F</figref> (or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>) because they are obscured by ring <b>78</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0130\">In the expanded state of implant <b>20</b>, each leg-tip <b>68</b> is radially aligned with convex region <b>154</b>. That is, each leg-tip <b>68</b> is disposed radially between convex-region inner radius r<b>3</b> and convex-region outer radius r<b>4</b>. This is also illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0131\">Tool <b>160</b> (e.g., capsule-portion <b>172</b> thereof) may then be withdrawn via lumen <b>38</b> of implant <b>20</b>, and removed from the body of the subject.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0132\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4, and 5A</figref>-C, which are schematic illustrations of implants, in accordance with some applications of the invention. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> shows an implant <b>120</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an implant <b>220</b>, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a frame assembly <b>222</b> of implant <b>220</b> after shape-setting, and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref> shows a valve frame <b>230</b> of frame assembly <b>222</b> prior to shape-setting (i.e., the shape-set valve-frame structure).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0133\">Implants <b>120</b> and <b>220</b> are typically the same as implant <b>20</b>, described hereinabove, except where noted. Sheeting <b>23</b> forms annular sheet <b>25</b> that is disposed over and typically stitched to arms <b>46</b>. Implant <b>120</b> thereby comprises valve body <b>32</b> (e.g., as described hereinabove), and an upstream support portion <b>140</b> that itself comprises arms <b>46</b> and annular sheet <b>25</b>. Similarly, implant <b>220</b> comprises valve body <b>32</b> and an upstream support portion <b>240</b> that itself comprises arms <b>46</b> and annular sheet <b>25</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0134\">Implants <b>120</b> and <b>220</b> each further comprises a respective plurality of elongate projections <b>146</b> or <b>246</b>. Whereas arms <b>46</b> are covered by sheeting <b>23</b>, the projections extend in an upstream direction through sheeting <b>23</b>. For some applications, and as shown for projections <b>146</b>, the projections extend through annular sheet <b>25</b>. For some applications, and as shown for projections <b>246</b>, the projections extend between annular sheet <b>25</b>, and a portion of sheeting <b>23</b> that lines valve body <b>32</b> (e.g., at a seam where these two portions of sheeting <b>23</b> are joined). The projections and arms <b>46</b> are both configured to be positioned in atrium <b>6</b> of the heart. For some applications, and as shown for projections <b>146</b>, the projections extend through annular sheet <b>25</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0135\">It is to be noted that projection <b>146</b> and <b>246</b> are distinct from appendages <b>80</b>, which are disposed at the other end of the valve body.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0136\">Each projection terminates in a nub <b>148</b> or <b>248</b> that facilitates snaring of the projection using a transcatheter snare, lasso, or similar tool. It is to be understood that the shapes shown for the nubs are merely examples, and that the scope of the invention includes any suitably shaped nub. It is hypothesized by the inventors that the projections facilitate repositioning and/or retrieval of the implant during and/or after implantation, using a snare, lasso, or similar tool. The projections are typically positioned and/or shaped such that nubs <b>148</b> or <b>248</b> are not in contact with annular sheet <b>25</b> or atrial tissue (e.g., are disposed at least 5 mm away (e.g., 5-25 mm away) from annular sheet <b>25</b> or atrial tissue). For some applications, and as shown for projections <b>146</b> of implant <b>120</b>, the projections curve outwards and then inwards toward the central longitudinal axis of the implant (i.e., are shaped to be concave toward the axis). For some applications, and as shown for projections <b>246</b> of implant <b>220</b>, the projections do not extend radially outward from the valve body. Projections <b>246</b> typically extend axially in an upstream direction away from the valve body (i.e., generally parallel to axis ax<b>1</b>, i.e., within 10 degrees of axis ax<b>1</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0137\">Regarding implant <b>120</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>), projections <b>146</b> extend from sites <b>35</b> in a similar way to arms <b>46</b>. Projections <b>146</b> may be structurally similar to arms <b>46</b>, and may even be identically cut when frame <b>30</b> is initially cut from the original metal tube (i.e., in the raw valve-frame structure). However, projections <b>146</b> have a different curvature to arms <b>46</b> (e.g., they may be bent differently post-cutting), and are curved such that they extend through annular sheet <b>25</b>. Whereas at least some of arms <b>46</b> typically reach and press against the atrial wall, projections <b>146</b> are typically shaped such that nubs <b>148</b> are not in contact with the atrial wall. Typically, each projection <b>146</b> replaces an arm <b>46</b>, such that the cumulative sum of arms and projections is twelve. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment comprising six arms <b>46</b> and six projections <b>146</b>, but the scope of the invention includes other ratios, such as nine arms <b>46</b> and three projections <b>146</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0138\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> shows implant <b>220</b>, comprising a frame assembly <b>222</b>, leaflets <b>58</b>, and sheeting <b>23</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> shows frame assembly <b>222</b> alone, the frame assembly comprising (i) a valve frame <b>230</b> that defines valve body <b>32</b>, and (ii) an outer frame <b>260</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref> shows the basic structure of valve frame <b>230</b>, as it is initially cut from a tube (typically a metallic tube, such as a Nitinol tube), e.g., before the frame is shape-set into the shape shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. Although this basic structure is tubular, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref> depicts the structure two-dimensionally, as though the cut-out structure were cut longitudinally, and unrolled to become flat.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0139\">Except where noted, frame assembly <b>222</b>, valve frame <b>230</b>, and outer frame <b>260</b> are typically identical to frame assembly <b>22</b>, valve frame <b>30</b>, and outer frame <b>60</b>, mutatis mutandis. For some applications, implant <b>220</b> is identical to implant <b>20</b> except for projections <b>246</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0140\">In contrast to projections <b>146</b> of implant <b>120</b>, each projection <b>246</b> of implant <b>220</b> extends from a respective site <b>37</b> that is at the upstream extremity (i.e., peak) of a respective first-row cell of upstream row <b>29</b> <i>a </i>of valve body <b>32</b> (i.e., from upstream end <b>34</b> of the valve body). Projections <b>246</b> thereby alternate with, rather than replace, arms <b>46</b>. Therefore, it is possible for implant <b>220</b> to comprise projections <b>246</b> in addition to twelve arms <b>46</b>. Implant <b>220</b> may comprise an equal number of projections <b>246</b> and arms <b>46</b>, but typically, the implant comprises fewer projections than arms. For example, implant <b>220</b> may comprise half as many, or fewer, projections <b>246</b> than arms <b>46</b>\u2014e.g., a third as many, or a quarter as many projections as arms. Projections <b>246</b> and arms <b>46</b> are typically evenly distributed circumferentially, and therefore typically at least two arms (e.g., at least three arms, such as at least four arms) are disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> show implant <b>220</b> comprising three projections <b>246</b> and twelve arms <b>46</b>, with four arms disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 11A-B</figref>, described hereinbelow, show an implant in which three arms are disposed circumferentially between each projection and each of its circumferentially-neighboring projections.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0141\">Each projection <b>246</b> has a projection-length d<b>13</b>, measured from the upstream extremity of the respective first-row cell (i.e., from site <b>37</b>). Each of the arms has an arm-length d<b>14</b>, measured from the upstream extremity of the respective second-row cell (i.e., site <b>35</b>). Arm-length d<b>14</b> is greater than projection-length d<b>13</b> (e.g., 2-20 times greater, e.g., 4-20 times greater, such as 4-10 times greater). For some applications, arm-length d<b>14</b> is 20-28 mm, such as 22-26 mm (e.g., 22-23 mm, 23.5-24.5 mm, or 25-26 mm). For some applications, projection-length d<b>13</b> is 2-10 mm (e.g., 3-8 mm, e.g., 4-6 mm, such as about 5 mm).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0142\">Typically, each arm <b>46</b> (i) has a narrow portion <b>46</b> <i>a </i>that is attached to, and extends from, the upstream extremity of the respective second-row cell, and (ii) at a widening zone <b>46</b> <i>b, </i>widens into a wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>that extends from the narrow portion, and is wider than the narrow portion. Narrow portion <b>46</b> <i>a </i>has a narrow-portion length d<b>20</b> that is typically at least 30 percent of arm-length d<b>14</b> (e.g., at least 40 percent, such as 40-80 percent, such as 40-60 percent). Wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>has a wide-portion length that is at least 30 percent of arm-length d<b>14</b> (e.g., at least 40 percent, such as 40-80 percent, such as 40-60 percent).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0143\">Wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>has a width d<b>15</b> that is typically 1.5-6 times greater (e.g., 2-4 times greater, such as 2.5-3.5 times greater) than a width d<b>16</b> of narrow portion <b>46</b> <i>a. </i>For some applications width d<b>15</b> is 1-2 mm (e.g., 1.4-1.8 mm, such as 1.6 mm). Width d<b>16</b> is typically 0.2-0.8 mm (e.g., 0.4-0.6 mm, such as 0.5 mm). It is to be noted that, although individual parts of arm <b>46</b> within portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>may be narrower than within portion <b>46</b> <i>a, </i>these individual parts form a back-and-forth pattern that results in wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>being, overall, wider than narrow portion <b>46</b> <i>a. </i>Typically, wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>is more flexible, in at least one plane, than narrow portion <b>46</b> <i>a. </i>Therefore, wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>is also a flexible portion of arm <b>46</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0144\">Each projection <b>246</b> has a width d<b>17</b> that is typically 0.2-0.8 mm (e.g., 0.4-0.6 mm, such as 0.5 mm). Each nub has a nub-width d<b>18</b> that is typically 1-2 mm (e.g., 1.4-1.8 mm, such as 1.6 mm), and a nub-length d<b>19</b> that is typically 0.5-1 mm (e.g., 0.7-0.9 mm, such as 0.8 mm). Wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>is typically at least 3 times (e.g., at least 10 times) longer than nub-length d<b>19</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0145\">As described hereinabove, the valve frame is typically monolithic, cut from a single tube. Typically, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref>, while valve frame <b>230</b> is in its raw valve-frame structure (e.g., described hereinabove with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A-E</figref>, mutatis mutandis), nubs <b>248</b> are disposed between arms <b>46</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref>, arms <b>46</b> and projections <b>246</b> may be dimensioned such that, while valve frame <b>230</b> is in its raw valve-frame structure, nubs <b>248</b> are disposed between narrow portions <b>46</b> <i>a </i>of arms <b>46</b>. That is, nubs <b>248</b> may be disposed axially closer than wide portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>to valve body <b>32</b>. Thereby, arms <b>46</b> and projections <b>246</b> efficiently fit adjacently to each other within a single cutout from tube of a particular diameter. Narrow-portion length d<b>20</b> is typically greater than projection-length d<b>13</b> (e.g., at least 1.5 times greater, such as 1.5-3 times greater).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0146\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, which shows the basic structure of a variant <b>230</b> <i>a </i>of valve frame <b>230</b>, in accordance with some applications of the invention. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows variant <b>230</b> <i>a </i>as it is initially cut from a tube (typically a metallic tube, such as a Nitinol tube), e.g., before the frame is shape-set. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows a two-dimensional view, as though the cut-out structure were cut longitudinally, and unrolled to become flat. Similarly to with frame <b>230</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref>), nubs <b>248</b> of variant <b>230</b> <i>a </i>are disposed between arms <b>46</b>. However, projections <b>246</b> <i>a </i>of variant <b>230</b> <i>a </i>are longer than projections <b>246</b> of frame <b>230</b>, and nubs <b>248</b> <i>a </i>are therefore disposed between wide portions <b>46</b> <i>c </i>of arms <b>46</b>. In order to accommodate this, in frame <b>230</b> <i>a, </i>at least the arms <b>46</b> that are adjacent to nubs <b>248</b> <i>a </i>are deflected circumferentially (which is represented two-dimensionally as being laterally deflected) compared to their positions in frame <b>230</b>, and are typically unevenly spaced. During subsequent shape setting, arms <b>46</b> are typically circumferentially displaced, e.g., such that they are evenly spaced. Variant <b>230</b> <i>a </i>may be used in place of any other valve frame described herein, mutatis mutandis.

Frame assembly <b>22</b> <i>b </i>comprises a valve frame <b>30</b> <i>b </i>and an outer frame <b>60</b> <i>b. </i>Except where noted, frame assembly <b>22</b> <i>b, </i>valve frame <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>and outer frame <b>60</b> <i>b </i>are as described for frame assembly <b>22</b>, valve frame <b>30</b>, and outer frame <b>60</b>, respectively.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0149\">Outer frame <b>60</b> <i>b </i>comprises (or defines) (1) a first (e.g., upstream) ring <b>74</b> <i>b </i>defined by a pattern of alternating first-ring peaks and first-ring troughs, (2) a second (e.g., downstream) ring <b>76</b> <i>b </i>defined by a pattern of alternating second-ring peaks and second-ring troughs, and a plurality of legs <b>50</b>, each of the legs coupled to the first ring and the second ring, and extending radially outward.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0150\">Valve frame <b>30</b> <i>b </i>comprises a tubular portion (e.g., a tubular frame) that has a cellular structure defined by a plurality of metallic elements with spaces therebetween a e.g., as described for valve frame <b>30</b>, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0151\">The cellular structure of the valve frames described herein may also be viewed as defining rings of alternating peaks and troughs, the rings circumscribing the longitudinal axis of the implant. Whereas the waveform (i.e., the peak-trough waveform) of the rings of the outer frame are in phase with each other, the phase of the waveform of the rings of the valve frame typically alternate with respect to each other. That is, for the valve frame, the waveform of one ring is out of phase (e.g., is in antiphase) with that of its axially-adjacent rings. For example, and with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1B</figref>, valve frame <b>30</b> defines a first (e.g., upstream) ring <b>182</b>, a second (e.g., middle) ring <b>184</b>, and a third (e.g., downstream) ring <b>186</b>, and ring <b>184</b> is in antiphase with rings <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>. Valve frame <b>30</b> <i>b </i>similarly defines a first (e.g., upstream) ring <b>182</b> <i>b, </i>a second (e.g., middle) ring <b>184</b> <i>b, </i>and a third (e.g., downstream) ring <b>186</b> <i>b, </i>and ring <b>184</b> <i>b </i>is in antiphase with rings <b>182</b> <i>b </i>and <b>184</b> <i>b. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0152\">Typically, and as shown for each of the implants described herein, when the frame assembly is assembled, (1) the waveform of one of outer frame rings is in-phase with the waveform of the inner frame ring with which it is axially aligned, and (2) the waveform of one of outer frame rings is out of phase (e.g., is in antiphase) with the waveform of the inner frame ring with which it is axially aligned. For example, and with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1C</figref>, ring <b>74</b> is in-phase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring <b>184</b>), whereas ring <b>76</b> is in antiphase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring <b>186</b>). Similarly, for frame assembly <b>22</b> <i>b, </i>ring <b>74</b> <i>b </i>is in-phase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring <b>184</b> <i>b</i>), whereas ring <b>76</b> <i>b </i>is in antiphase with the ring of the inner frame with which it is axially aligned (ring <b>186</b> <i>b</i>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0153\">Because ring <b>76</b> <i>b </i>is in antiphase with ring <b>186</b> <i>b, </i>the peaks of ring <b>76</b> <i>b </i>are not disposed directly radially outward from respective parts of frame <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>and therefore are not in contact with frame <b>30</b> <i>b. </i>However, despite ring <b>74</b> <i>b </i>being in phase with ring <b>184</b> <i>b, </i>and the peaks of ring <b>74</b> <i>b </i>being disposed directly radially outward from respective parts of frame <b>30</b> <i>b, </i>the peaks of ring <b>74</b> <i>b </i>are also not in contact with frame <b>30</b> <i>b. </i>That is, frame assembly <b>22</b> defines a radial gap <b>188</b> between frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> at the peaks of ring <b>74</b> <i>b. </i>Typically, therefore, none of the peaks of the rings of frame <b>60</b> <i>b </i>is in contact with inner frame <b>30</b> <i>b. </i>In contrast, for frame assembly <b>22</b>, although the peaks of ring <b>76</b> are not in contact with frame <b>30</b>, the peaks of ring <b>74</b> typically are in contact with frame <b>30</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0154\">The features of frame assembly <b>22</b> <i>b </i>may be used in combination with other implants described herein. For example, other frame assemblies described herein may be shaped to define gap <b>188</b>, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0155\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9A-B</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of an inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>and an implant <b>320</b> <i>a </i>comprising inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>in accordance with some applications of the invention. Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>may be used in place of other inner frames of implants described herein, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>may be used in combination with other technologies described herein, mutatis mutandis. Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion) <b>332</b> <i>a </i>that has an upstream end <b>334</b> <i>a </i>and a downstream end <b>336</b> <i>a, </i>and is shaped to define a lumen through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>further comprises a plurality of arms <b>46</b>, each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body <b>332</b> <i>a. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0156\">Valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>has a cellular structure defined by a plurality of joists <b>28</b> connected at a plurality of nodes <b>102</b>, the joists and nodes delimiting cells of the cellular structure. Except where noted, inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>is generally the same as inner frame <b>230</b> (or inner frame <b>30</b>), mutatis mutandis, and valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>is generally the same as valve body <b>32</b>, mutatis mutandis. Compared to valve body <b>32</b>, valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>comprises additional joists <b>28</b>, which are hypothesized by the inventors to increase strength and rigidity. In particular, the additional joists are hypothesized by the inventors to increase the resistance of the valve body to compression toward axis ax<b>1</b>, including resistance to circumferential compression (e.g., compression that would otherwise reduce the diameter of the valve body, but that would retain the valve body in a generally cylindrical shape) and localized compression (e.g., compression that would otherwise reduce the diameter of the valve body at only certain locations, causing the valve body to become more oval in transverse cross-section).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0157\">Referring back to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1A-B</figref>, the cellular structure of valve body <b>32</b> is such that its nodes <b>100</b> typically connect 2-4 of its joists. For example, a node <b>100</b> <i>a </i>connects two joists, and a node <b>100</b> <i>b </i>connects four joists. (In this context, neither arms <b>46</b> nor projections <b>246</b> are joists of the valve body&#39;s cellular structure, and so sites <b>35</b> and <b>34</b> are also nodes that connect 2-4 joists.) In contrast, the cellular structure of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>is such that some of its nodes <b>102</b> are minor nodes <b>104</b>, and some are major nodes <b>106</b>. Minor nodes <b>104</b> connect 2-4 joists, whereas major nodes <b>106</b> connect 6-8 joists. Typically, and as shown, major nodes <b>106</b> connect 6 joists (again, excluding arms <b>46</b>, which are not joists of the valve body&#39;s cellular structure). Typically, and as shown, minor nodes <b>104</b> connect 2 joists. Therefore, for some applications, none of the nodes <b>102</b> of the cellular structure of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>connects 4 joists.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0158\">Similarly to valve body <b>32</b> of frame <b>30</b>, the cells of the cellular structure of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>comprise a first circumferential row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>of cells, and a second circumferential row <b>109</b> <i>b </i>of cells. That is, row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>is a row of first-row cells, and row <b>109</b> <i>b </i>is a row of second-row cells. Each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>is connected to each of its circumferentially-adjacent first-row cells at a respective major node <b>106</b>. Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>is longitudinally delimited by two minor nodes <b>104</b> (i.e., the upstream end and the downstream end of each cell is at a respective minor node). It is to be noted that, typically, each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>is not connected to another cell at these minor nodes <b>104</b> (i.e., the minor nodes that longitudinally delimit the first-row cell).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0159\">Each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>b </i>is connected to each of its circumferentially-adjacent second-row cells at a respective major node <b>106</b>. Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>b </i>is longitudinally delimited by at least one major node <b>106</b> (e.g., is delimited by one major node at an upstream end of the cell). Typically, and as shown, each of the cells of row <b>109</b> <i>b </i>is also longitudinally delimited by a minor node <b>104</b> (e.g., at a downstream end of the cell). For some applications, and as shown, each of the major nodes <b>106</b> at which circumferentially-adjacent first-row cells are connected is also the major node that longitudinally-delimits a respective second-row cell (e.g., at the upstream end of the second-row cell). In the example shown, that common major node <b>106</b> is also site <b>35</b>, at which arms <b>46</b> are attached to the valve body.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0160\">The cells of the cellular structure of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>are typically delimited by exactly four nodes <b>102</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0161\">Frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>defines coupling elements <b>31</b>, which are fixed to coupling elements <b>61</b> of frame <b>60</b> at coupling points, as described hereinabove for frame assembly <b>22</b>, mutatis mutandis. For some applications, and as shown, coupling elements <b>31</b> are defined by respective major nodes <b>106</b>. Therefore, for some applications, a frame assembly comprises (i) inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>that defines valve body <b>332</b> <i>a, </i>and (ii) an outer frame (e.g., frame <b>60</b>) that circumscribes the valve body, and is coupled to the inner frame by being fixed to major nodes of the valve body. For such applications, coupling elements <b>31</b> are typically defined by the major nodes at which circumferentially-adjacent second-row cells are connected.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0162\">For some applications, and as shown, valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>is defined by exactly two stacked, tessellated rows <b>109</b> of cells. That is, typically, first row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>is the most upstream row, second row <b>108</b> <i>b </i>is the most downstream row, and these two rows are tessellated with each other. Therefore, for some applications, all the cells of the cellular structure of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>are either first-row cells or second-row cells.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0163\">Valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>may be described as comprising pairs <b>108</b> of joists <b>28</b> that run generally parallel to each other. In the expanded state of the valve body (i.e., the state shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) the joists <b>28</b> of each pair <b>108</b> are disposed 0.1-1 mm (e.g., 0.25-0.9 mm, such as 0.25-0.65 mm) from each other. Although the joists <b>28</b> of each pair <b>108</b> run generally parallel to each other, they typically only share one node <b>102</b> in common. That shared common node is typically a major node <b>106</b>. That is, at a first end of each pair <b>108</b>, both joists <b>28</b> are typically connected to each other at a major node. In some cases, at a second end of each pair <b>108</b>, one of the joists connects to another major node <b>106</b>, but the other joist connects to a minor node <b>104</b> that is disposed a distance d<b>12</b> away from the major node at the second end of the pair. In other cases, at the second end of each pair <b>108</b>, one of the joists connects to a first minor node, and the other joist connects to another minor node that is disposed a distance d<b>12</b> away from the first minor node. Distance d<b>12</b> is typically 0.1-1 mm (e.g., 0.25-0.9 mm, such as 0.25-0.65 mm).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0164\">For some applications, and as shown, the arrangement of joists <b>28</b> in pairs <b>108</b> results in the joists that delimit the cells of first row <b>109</b> <i>a </i>not delimiting the cells of second row <b>109</b> <i>b</i>. That is, for some applications, no individual joist <b>28</b> delimits both a first-row cell and a second-row cell.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0165\">Another aspect of valve body <b>332</b> <i>a </i>is as follows: Major nodes <b>106</b> are typically arranged in major-node rows, each major-node row circumscribing longitudinal axis ax<b>1</b> at a respective major-node-row longitudinal site, and minor nodes <b>104</b> are typically arranged in minor-node rows, each minor-node row circumscribing the longitudinal axis at a respective minor-node-row longitudinal site. Along at least part of axis ax<b>1</b>, the minor-node-row longitudinal sites alternate with the major-node-row longitudinal sites. For some applications, along at least this part of axis ax<b>1</b>, at least 3 minor-node-row longitudinal sites alternate with at least 2 major-node-row longitudinal sites, e.g., in the order minor-major-minor-major-minor, as shown.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0166\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10A-B</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of an inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b, </i>and an implant <b>320</b> <i>b </i>comprising inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b, </i>in accordance with some applications of the invention.

Valve frame <b>330</b> <i>b </i>further comprises a plurality of arms <b>46</b>, each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body <b>332</b> <i>b. </i>Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b </i>is typically the same as inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>except where noted. Compared to inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b </i>comprises additional joists <b>28</b> at upstream end <b>334</b> <i>b. </i>That is, in contrast to inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>for inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b </i>pairs <b>108</b> of joists are also disposed at the upstream side of the upstream row of cells.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0168\">In frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>sites <b>37</b> are coincident with the upstream extremity of a respective upstream-row cell.

Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>may be used in place of other inner frames of implants described herein, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0171\">Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>comprises a valve body (which is a generally tubular portion) <b>332</b> <i>c </i>that has an upstream end <b>334</b> <i>c </i>and a downstream end <b>336</b> <i>c, </i>and is shaped to define a lumen through the valve body from its upstream end to its downstream end. Valve frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>further comprises a plurality of arms <b>46</b>, each of which, in the expanded state, extends radially outward from valve body <b>332</b> <i>c. </i>Inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>is typically the same as inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b, </i>except where noted.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0172\">In general, for implants having an expandable cellular structure, such as the valve bodies described herein, for a given size of the implant, a cellular structure that defines fewer, larger cells, advantageously facilitates radial compression (i.e., \u201ccrimping\u201d) to a smaller diameter than does a comparable cellular structure that defines more, smaller cells. However, this is typically at the expense of strength and rigidity of the expanded valve. As described hereinabove, the presence of additional joists <b>28</b> (e.g., in inner frames <b>330</b> <i>a, </i> <b>330</b> <i>b, </i>and <b>330</b> <i>c</i>) to form pairs <b>108</b> is hypothesized to increase strength and rigidity, in particular with respect to compression toward the central longitudinal axis. As a result, it is further hypothesized by the inventors that using such a paired joist cellular structure facilitates reducing the number, and increasing the size, of the cells of the valve body, in order to achieve a valve body that is radially compressible to a smaller diameter while maintaining sufficient strength and rigidity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0173\">Accordingly, valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>of inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>has fewer, larger cells compared to valve body <b>32</b> of inner frame <b>30</b>, and is therefore radially compressible to a smaller diameter. Whereas each row of cells of valve body <b>32</b> includes 12 cells, each row of cells of valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>includes 9 cells. More generally, whereas the rotationally-symmetrical pattern of valve body <b>32</b> has 12 repeats (e.g., 12 cells per cell row, 12 minor nodes per minor-node row, 12 major nodes per major-node row, 12 coupling elements, 12 arms <b>46</b>), the rotationally-symmetrical pattern of valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>has only 9 repeats. (Both valve body <b>32</b> and valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>typically have 3 appendages <b>80</b> and 3 projections <b>246</b>.) Both valve body <b>32</b> and valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>define two rows of cells. Therefore. whereas valve body <b>32</b> defines 24 cells in total, valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>defines 18 cells in total. Whereas valve body <b>32</b> defines exactly 24 major nodes, valve body <b>332</b> <i>c </i>defines exactly 18 major nodes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0174\">For some applications, and as shown, inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>comprises additional joists <b>28</b> at upstream end <b>334</b> <i>c </i>(e.g., similarly to inner frame <b>330</b> <i>b</i>). That is, for such applications, pairs <b>108</b> of joists are typically also disposed at the upstream side of the upstream row of cells of inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c. </i>For such applications, implant <b>320</b> <i>c </i>is typically the same as implant <b>320</b> <i>b, </i>except that implant <b>320</b> <i>c </i>comprises 9 rotationally-symmetrical repeats, rather than 12.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0175\">For some applications, inner frame <b>330</b> <i>c </i>does not comprise additional joists <b>28</b> at upstream end <b>334</b> <i>c, </i>and is instead more like inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a </i>in this regard.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0176\">Reference is again made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9A-11B</figref>.

For example, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12C-E</figref>, a bath <b>306</b> of fluid <b>310</b> <i>f </i>may be prepared, and frame <b>60</b> may be inverted and lowered into the bath such that models <b>302</b> are supported within the fluid (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12C</figref>). First substance <b>310</b> is allowed to solidify into solidified first substance <b>310</b> <i>s </i>(<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12D</figref>). Subsequently, frame <b>60</b> is withdrawn from the bath, thereby removing models <b>302</b> from solidified first substance <b>310</b> <i>s, </i>such that each model leaves a respective cavity <b>308</b> in solidified first substance <b>310</b> <i>s </i>(<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12E</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0157\" num=\"0179\">Models <b>302</b> are then removed from flanges <b>54</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12F</figref>). Pads <b>300</b> are then formed by: (i) placing flanges <b>54</b> in contact with a second substance <b>312</b> by repositioning the frame such that each flange is supported within a respective cavity <b>308</b>, and introducing a fluid <b>312</b> <i>f </i>of the second substance to the cavity (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12G</figref>), and (ii) while the flange remains in contact with the second substance, allowing the second substance to solidify into solidified second substance <b>312</b> <i>s </i>and to become affixed to the flange. Subsequently, flanges <b>54</b> are removed from cavities <b>308</b> with formed pads <b>300</b> (comprising solidified second substance <b>312</b> <i>s</i>) affixed to the flanges (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12H</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0158\" num=\"0180\">The technique described with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-H</figref> may be used with a frame that has a single tissue-engaging flange. However, as shown, the technique is typically used with a frame that has a plurality of flanges, e.g., to augment all the flanges simultaneously. It is to be noted that flanges <b>54</b> are not all disposed on the same side of frame assembly <b>22</b> (i.e., after frames <b>30</b> and <b>60</b> have been attached to each other). For example, flanges <b>54</b> are not all at the upstream end of the prosthetic valve or at the downstream end of the prosthetic valve. Rather, they are disposed downstream of the tips of arms <b>46</b> and upstream of downstream end <b>26</b>. Furthermore, flanges <b>54</b> are arranged circumferentially around the longitudinal axis of the prosthetic valve. Flanges <b>54</b> (and eventually pads <b>300</b>) are arranged circumferentially around frame <b>30</b> longitudinally between the upstream end and the downstream end of frame <b>30</b>, exclusive. For some applications, the flanges being not all disposed on the same side might inhibit the use of the technique of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-H</figref> to simultaneously augment all of the flanges. For example, it may be difficult to place all of models <b>302</b> into the fluid first substance, or to place all of flanges <b>54</b> into the fluid second substance, without also placing other portions of the frame assembly into the fluid substance. The two-frame nature of frame assembly <b>22</b> advantageously allows flanges <b>54</b> to be augmented with pads before frame <b>60</b> is attached to frame <b>30</b>. Because all of flanges <b>54</b> are disposed at the same side (e.g., the upstream side) of frame <b>60</b>, they can all be placed into the fluid substances simultaneously.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0159\" num=\"0181\">An alternative solution is also contemplated by the inventors, in which an annular bath is positioned circumscribing the central portion of the prosthetic valve or frame assembly, such that all flanges can be placed into the fluid substances even when the flanges are not all disposed on the same side of a prosthetic valve or frame assembly.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0182\">For some applications, substance <b>310</b> and/or substance <b>312</b> may be a mixture of constituents that is initially fluid upon mixing, and that solidifies as the constituents react with each other. For some applications, fluid substance <b>310</b> <i>f </i>and/or fluid substance <b>312</b> <i>f </i>is fluid because it is in a molten state, and solidifies as it cools. When solidified, second substance <b>312</b> is typically soft, flexible, and/or resilient. For some applications, second substance <b>312</b> (or at least solidified second substance <b>312</b> <i>s</i>) is a foam. For some applications, second substance <b>312</b> comprises silicone, polyurethane, a thermoplastic elastomer such as Santoprene\u2122, and/or polyether block amide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0183\">For some applications, the techniques described with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-H</figref> are alternatively or additionally used, mutatis mutandis, to augment the downstream end of the implant with one or more pads, e.g., to serve a similar function to ring <b>78</b> described hereinabove.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0184\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-E</figref>, <b>14</b>A-D, <b>15</b>A-C, <b>16</b>A-C, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>A-C, and <b>19</b>, which are schematic illustrations of an implant <b>420</b>, and steps in the assembly of the implant, in accordance with some applications of the invention. In particular, these figures illustrate steps in the attachment of various flexible components to the frame assembly of the implant, such as steps in the dressing of the frame assembly with various sheets of flexible material. Implant <b>420</b> is shown as comprising frame assembly <b>222</b>, and is typically identical to implant <b>220</b> except for where described otherwise. However, it is to be noted that the steps described with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-18C</figref> may be used, mutatis mutandis, to assemble other implants, including the other implants described herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0185\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-E</figref> show flexible components of implant <b>420</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13A-B</figref> are perspective and side views, respectively, of a valvular assembly <b>430</b>, comprising leaflets <b>58</b> arranged to serve as a check valve. In valvular assembly <b>430</b>, each leaflet <b>58</b> defines (i) an upstream surface <b>457</b>, past which blood will flow through implant <b>420</b> in an upstream-to-downstream direction, and (ii) a downstream surface <b>459</b>, against which blood will press when the valvular assembly closes and inhibits blood flow in a downstream-to-upstream direction. Valvular assembly <b>430</b> typically further comprises a liner <b>427</b> and/or a plurality of connectors <b>432</b>. Liner <b>427</b> of implant <b>420</b> generally corresponds to liner <b>27</b> of implant <b>20</b>, mutatis mutandis. Typically, valvular assembly <b>430</b> comprises three leaflets <b>58</b> and three connectors <b>432</b>. Connectors <b>432</b> couple the leaflets to each other to form commissures, and are used to secure the leaflets, at the commissures, to frame assembly <b>222</b>. Connectors <b>432</b> are arranged circumferentially, and leaflets <b>58</b> extend radially inward from the connectors. For some applications, valvular assembly <b>430</b>, and connectors <b>432</b> in particular, are as described in PCT patent application publication WO 2018/029680 to Hariton et al., and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/878,206 to Hariton et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0186\">Each leaflet <b>58</b> is attached (e.g., stitched) to liner <b>427</b> along a line (e.g., a stitch line) <b>437</b>. Each leaflet <b>58</b> defines a free edge <b>458</b>, which is typically straight, and at which the leaflet coapts with the other leaflets <b>58</b>. Stitch line <b>437</b> is typically curved. Each leaflet typically defines a curved edge (e.g., an upstream edge) <b>456</b> at which the leaflet is attached to liner <b>427</b>. The curve of edge <b>456</b> and/or stitch line <b>437</b> is concave toward the downstream end of valvular assembly <b>430</b>, such that edge <b>456</b> and/or stitch line <b>437</b> (i) become closer to the downstream end of the valvular assembly at connectors <b>432</b>, and (ii) are closest to the upstream end of the valvular assembly about midway circumferentially between the connectors. That is, edge <b>456</b> has an apex about midway circumferentially between connectors <b>432</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0187\">Typically, and as shown, leaflets <b>58</b> extend further axially downstream (i.e., downstream with respect to axis ax<b>1</b>) than does liner <b>427</b>. Therefore, a downstream portion of each leaflet <b>58</b> is typically circumferentially exposed from liner <b>427</b>. For some applications, and as shown, liner <b>427</b> is shaped to define regions <b>428</b> at which a downstream edge <b>436</b> of the liner recedes from the downstream end of valvular assembly <b>430</b>. At each region <b>428</b>, more of the respective leaflet <b>58</b> is circumferentially exposed. Each region <b>428</b> is typically circumferentially aligned with the concavity defined by edge <b>456</b> and/or stitch line <b>437</b>. At regions <b>428</b>, downstream edge <b>436</b> of liner <b>427</b> is typically stitched to ring <b>182</b> of frame <b>230</b>. Therefore, for some applications, the most upstream parts of downstream edge <b>436</b> of liner <b>427</b> are closer to the upstream end of the implant than is the most downstream parts of arms <b>46</b>. As described in more detail hereinbelow, in implant <b>420</b>, regions <b>428</b> of liner <b>427</b> facilitate the provision of windows <b>482</b> into a pouch <b>490</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0188\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13C</figref> shows a sheet <b>440</b> of flexible material. Typically, and as shown, sheet <b>440</b> is provided flat, and in the shape of a major arc of an annulus, having a first arc-end <b>442</b> <i>a </i>and a second arc-end <b>442</b> <i>b. </i>Sheet <b>440</b> of implant <b>420</b> generally corresponds to annular sheet <b>25</b> of implant <b>20</b>, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0189\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13D</figref> shows a sheet <b>450</b> of flexible material. Sheet <b>450</b> is annular, and defines an inner perimeter <b>452</b>, an outer perimeter <b>454</b>, and a radial dimension d<b>21</b> therebetween.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0190\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13E</figref> shows a sheet <b>460</b> of flexible material. Sheet <b>460</b> is shaped to define a belt <b>462</b> and a plurality of elongate strips <b>464</b>. Each strip <b>464</b> defines a respective central strip-axis ax<b>2</b>, and extends along its strip-axis from belt <b>462</b> to the end <b>466</b> of the strip. Typically, belt <b>462</b> is linear and defines a belt-axis ax<b>3</b>, and strip-axis ax<b>2</b> is orthogonal to the belt-axis. Typically, strips <b>464</b> are parallel to each other. Each strip <b>464</b> has first and second edges <b>468</b> (e.g., a first edge <b>468</b> <i>a </i>and a second edge <b>468</b> <i>b</i>), which extend on either side of axis ax<b>2</b>, between belt <b>462</b> and end <b>466</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0191\">As indicated by the reference numeral <b>23</b>, sheets <b>440</b>, <b>450</b>, and <b>460</b> may all be considered components of sheeting <b>23</b>. For some applications, liner <b>427</b>, sheet <b>440</b>, sheet <b>450</b>, and/or <b>460</b> comprise (e.g., consist of) the same material as each other. Typically, sheets <b>440</b>, <b>450</b>, and <b>460</b> are provided as flat, and are subsequently shaped during assembly of implant <b>420</b>, e.g., as described hereinbelow.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0192\">For applications in which sheet <b>440</b> is provided flat and in the shape of a major arc of an annulus, sheet <b>440</b> is shaped into an open frustum by attaching (e.g., stitching) ends <b>442</b> <i>a </i>and <b>442</b> <i>b </i>together (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 14A-B</figref>). This is represented by a stitch line <b>444</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14B</figref>. Alternatively, sheet <b>440</b> may be provided in the open frustum shape. The open frustum shape has a greater perimeter <b>446</b> at a first base of the frustum, and a smaller perimeter <b>448</b> at a second base of the frustum. Perimeter <b>448</b> defines an opening, and sheet <b>440</b> is stitched to arms <b>46</b> such that the opening is aligned with the lumen defined by valve body <b>32</b> of frame <b>30</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14C</figref>), and typically such that the sheet covers an upstream side of the arms. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14D</figref> shows valvular assembly <b>430</b> having been coupled to frame assembly <b>222</b>. This step may be performed after sheet <b>440</b> is stitched to arms <b>46</b> (as shown) or beforehand. Valvular assembly <b>430</b> is placed inside valve body <b>32</b> of frame <b>30</b>, and is attached by stitching connectors <b>432</b> and liner <b>427</b> to frame assembly <b>222</b>. Connectors <b>432</b> are typically stitched to ring <b>184</b> and/or ring <b>186</b>. For some applications, the attachment of connectors <b>432</b> to frame assembly <b>222</b> is as described in PCT patent application publication WO 2018/029680 to Hariton et al., and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/878,206 to Hariton et al., both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0193\">Smaller perimeter <b>448</b> of sheet <b>440</b> is stitched to an upstream edge <b>434</b> of liner <b>427</b>, to form a substantially sealed channel through implant <b>420</b>. This stitching is represented by a stitch line <b>435</b>. Typically, and as shown, projections <b>246</b> extend between, and are sandwiched between, perimeter <b>448</b> of sheet <b>440</b> and upstream edge <b>434</b> of liner <b>427</b>. Upstream edge <b>434</b> is typically circular.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0194\">Downstream edge <b>436</b> of liner <b>427</b> is stitched to valve body <b>32</b> of frame <b>30</b>. Typically, downstream edge <b>436</b> is shaped and positioned to approximately conform to rings <b>182</b> and <b>184</b>, and is stitched to these rings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0195\">It is to be noted that throughout this patent application (including the specification and the claims) stitching of a perimeter or edge of a sheet to a perimeter or edge of another sheet, does not necessarily mean that the sheets are stitched at their absolute edges (i.e., their free edges). Rather, in this context, the \u201cperimeter\u201d or \u201cedge\u201d also includes the adjacent area of the sheet, as is understood by one of ordinary skill in the stitching art, and as is typically required for effective stitching.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0196\">Valvular assembly <b>430</b> is typically positioned within frame assembly such that the apex of curved edge <b>456</b> of each leaflet <b>58</b> is disposed axially close to (e.g., axially within 2 mm of, e.g., within 1 mm of) an upstream end <b>34</b> of valve body <b>32</b>. Valvular assembly <b>430</b> is also typically positioned within frame assembly such that free edge <b>458</b> of each leaflet <b>58</b> is disposed downstream of leg <b>50</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0197\">Subsequently, sheet <b>450</b> is attached to frame assembly <b>222</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 15A-C</figref>). Outer perimeter <b>454</b> of sheet <b>450</b> is stitched to greater perimeter <b>446</b> of the sheet <b>440</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref>). This is represented by stitch line <b>455</b>. Typically, perimeter <b>454</b> is larger than perimeter <b>446</b>, and is brought inwards to be stitched to perimeter <b>446</b> (e.g., making sheet <b>450</b> frustoconical), with inner perimeter <b>452</b> disposed axially away from frame assembly <b>222</b> (e.g., further axially away than outer perimeter <b>454</b> from the frame assembly).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0198\">Subsequently, sheet <b>450</b> is everted by bringing inner perimeter <b>452</b> toward frame assembly <b>222</b>, and passing the inner perimeter around the tips of arms <b>46</b>\u2014i.e., axially past the tips of all of the arms (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15B</figref>). Typically, and as shown, arms <b>46</b> collectively define an arm-span d<b>23</b> that is wider than perimeter <b>452</b>. That is, the tips of arms <b>46</b> typically define a perimeter that is greater than perimeter <b>452</b>. For some applications, the passage of inner perimeter <b>452</b> around the tips of arms <b>46</b> is facilitated by bending (e.g., temporarily) one or more of arms <b>46</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0199\">Inner perimeter <b>452</b> is advanced over at least part of valve body <b>32</b> toward a downstream end of frame assembly <b>222</b>, and is stitched in place. Typically, perimeter <b>452</b> is advanced between the valve body and legs <b>50</b>, such that perimeter <b>452</b> circumscribes valve body <b>32</b>, and legs <b>50</b> are disposed radially outside of sheet <b>450</b>. As described hereinabove, each leg <b>50</b> extends radially outward and in an upstream direction from a respective leg-base <b>66</b> to a respective leg-tip <b>68</b>. Each leg therefore extends at an acute angle to define a respective cleft <b>250</b> between the leg and valve body <b>32</b> (e.g., the tubular portion), the cleft open to the upstream direction. Typically, perimeter <b>452</b> is tucked into clefts <b>250</b>, and is stitched into place. Frame assembly <b>222</b> defines a distance d<b>22</b>, measured along a straight line, between the ends of arms <b>46</b> and clefts <b>250</b>. For clarity, distance d<b>22</b> may be defined as a distance between (i) an imaginary ring described by the ends of arms <b>46</b>, and (ii) an imaginary ring described by clefts <b>250</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0200\">The dimensions and positioning of sheet <b>450</b> defines an inflatable pouch <b>490</b> that is bounded by sheet <b>450</b> (e.g., defining an outer and/or downstream wall of the pouch), sheet <b>440</b> (e.g., defining an upstream wall of the pouch), and liner <b>427</b> (e.g., defining an inner wall of the pouch). Pouch <b>490</b> typically circumscribes the longitudinal axis of the implant and/or the valve body of frame assembly <b>222</b> (e.g., the pouch is a cuff), and further typically extends radially outward from the valve body. Typically, an upstream portion of pouch <b>490</b> is attached to valve frame <b>30</b> (e.g., and is not attached to outer frame <b>60</b>), and a downstream portion of the pouch is attached to the outer frame. As described in more detail hereinbelow, at least one respective window <b>482</b> into pouch <b>490</b> is defined between each leaflet <b>58</b> and perimeter <b>452</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0201\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 16A-C</figref> show steps in dressing frame assembly <b>222</b> with sheet <b>460</b>, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Each strip <b>464</b> is formed into a respective pocket <b>478</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 16A-B</figref>). Each strip is folded over itself, about a fold-line <b>463</b> that is orthogonal to strip-axis ax<b>2</b>, thereby forming (i) a first strip-portion <b>464</b> <i>a </i>that extends from belt <b>462</b> to the fold-line, and (ii) a second strip-portion <b>464</b> <i>b </i>that extends from fold-line back toward the belt. First strip-portion <b>464</b> <i>a </i>and second strip-portion <b>464</b> <i>b </i>are stitched together at first edge <b>468</b> <i>a </i>and second edge <b>468</b> <i>b. </i>The resulting pocket <b>478</b> is typically elongate, and has (i) an opening <b>470</b> defined at least in part by end <b>466</b> of the strip, and (ii) a tip <b>472</b> at the fold-line.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0202\">For some applications, a soft pad <b>476</b> is provided in each pocket <b>478</b>, typically at tip <b>472</b>. For some such applications, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15B</figref>, pad <b>476</b> is formed from a piece of foam <b>474</b> (e.g., comprising polyurethane). Piece of foam <b>474</b> may initially be generally cubic. For some applications, and as shown, piece of foam <b>474</b> is folded to form a niche <b>477</b> in pad <b>476</b>, typically after having been at least partly flattened by compression. Pad <b>476</b> may be introduced into pocket <b>478</b> before the pocket is fully formed (e.g., as shown), or may be subsequently introduced into the pocket via opening <b>470</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0203\">Alternatively, pads <b>300</b> may be used in place of pads <b>476</b>, and may be added to flanges <b>54</b> as described with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-H</figref>, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0204\">For applications in which pad <b>476</b> is used, each strip-portion <b>464</b> <i>a </i>and <b>464</b> <i>b </i>typically defines a widened region <b>479</b> adjacent to fold-line <b>463</b>, such that when pockets <b>478</b> are formed, a receptacle for pad <b>476</b> is formed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0205\">Pockets <b>478</b> are subsequently slid onto legs <b>50</b>, and belt <b>462</b> is wrapped around frame assembly <b>222</b> downstream of legs <b>50</b> (e.g., downstream of the axial level at which the legs are coupled to the valve body). Belt <b>462</b> is typically positioned such that it is disposed over the commissures of leaflets <b>58</b> and/or over connectors <b>432</b>. That is, the belt is typically wrapped around the frame assembly at an axial level such t For applications in which pads <b>476</b> are used, flanges <b>54</b> of legs <b>50</b> are typically advanced into niches <b>477</b> of the pads. Belt <b>462</b> (e.g., the edge of the belt from which pockets <b>478</b> extend) is stitched to sheet <b>450</b>. More specifically, the upstream edge of belt <b>462</b> is stitched circumferentially to perimeter <b>452</b> of sheet <b>450</b>. This is represented by a stitch line <b>465</b>. Therefore, once implant <b>420</b> is assembled, the edge of belt <b>462</b> from which pockets <b>478</b> extend is an upstream edge of the belt, while the edge that is closest to the downstream end of the implant is a downstream edge of the belt. Legs <b>50</b>, within pockets <b>478</b>, extend radially outward from between belt <b>462</b> and sheet <b>450</b> (e.g., at stitch line <b>465</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0206\">For some applications, tips <b>472</b> and/or pads <b>476</b> are further secured to flanges <b>54</b> by stitching <b>475</b>, which may pass through a hole <b>55</b> (labeled in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1A</figref>) defined in each flange <b>54</b>. Stitching <b>475</b> is visible in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 18A-C</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0207\">As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16C</figref>, for some applications, polytetrafluoroethylene ring <b>78</b> is typically also attached to frame assembly <b>222</b>. For some such applications, in addition to being stitched to frame assembly <b>222</b>, ring <b>78</b> is also stitched to belt <b>462</b> (e.g., to the edge of the belt opposite pockets <b>478</b>\u2014i.e., the downstream edge of the belt).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0208\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> shows a ribbon <b>480</b> being wrapped around the leg-base <b>66</b> of each leg <b>50</b>, in accordance with some applications of the invention. For some applications, the ends of ribbon <b>480</b> overlap. Ribbons <b>480</b> are stitched in place, but the stitches are typically not disposed in cleft <b>250</b>. As shown, ribbons <b>480</b> may be stitched to belt <b>462</b>. Although ribbons <b>480</b> are shown being used in combination with pockets <b>478</b> (and are therefore wrapped around the pockets at leg-base <b>66</b>), it is to be noted that ribbons <b>480</b> may alternatively be used for applications in which legs <b>50</b> are generally uncovered. Ribbon <b>480</b> covers cleft <b>250</b>, and is hypothesized by the inventors to reduce a likelihood of tissue (e.g., leaflet or chordae tissue) from becoming wedged in and/or damaged by the cleft.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0209\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 18A-C</figref> show implant <b>420</b> after its assembly. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref> is an upper perspective view (e.g., showing upstream surfaces of the implant), <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18B</figref> shows a side view, and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18C</figref> shows a lower perspective view (e.g., showing downstream surfaces of the implant).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0210\">As described with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3E-F</figref>, implant <b>20</b> (which comprises frame assembly <b>22</b>) is secured in place at the native valve by sandwiching tissue of the native valve between the implant&#39;s upstream support portion <b>40</b> and flanges <b>54</b>. Implants that comprise frame assembly <b>222</b>, such as implant <b>220</b>, are typically secured in the same way, mutatis mutandis. Implants that further comprise pouch <b>490</b>, such as implant <b>420</b>, are typically secured similarly, but with pouch <b>490</b> disposed between the upstream support portion and the tissue of the native valve. Therefore in at least some regions of implant <b>420</b>, the tissue of the native valve is sandwiched between flanges <b>54</b> and pouch <b>490</b>, e.g., as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0211\">Windows <b>482</b> open into pouch <b>490</b> from the lumen of the valve body. Once implant <b>420</b> has been implanted at the native valve, windows <b>482</b> are disposed functionally within ventricle <b>8</b>, whereas at least portions of pouch <b>490</b> are disposed functionally within atrium <b>6</b>. Therefore, during ventricular systole, ventricular pressure (which is much greater than atrial pressure) forces blood into pouch <b>490</b>, thereby inflating the pouch. This inflation presses pouch <b>490</b> against the tissue of the native valve. It is hypothesized by the inventors that this inhibits paravalvular leakage of blood, especially during ventricular systole. For example, the pouch may seal a paravalvular gap at the commissures of the native valve. For some applications, inflation of pouch <b>490</b> squeezes tissue of the native valve (e.g., native leaflets) between the pouch and flanges <b>54</b>. Pouch <b>490</b> is typically dimensioned such that if, in a particular region, tissue is not disposed between a flange <b>54</b> and pouch <b>490</b>, inflation of the pouch presses the pouch against the flange.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0212\">There is therefore provided, in accordance with an application of the present invention, apparatus, comprising:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0018-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0019-0001\" num=\"0213\">a frame assembly (e.g., frame assembly <b>222</b>) that comprises: (i) a valve body that circumscribes a longitudinal axis and defines a lumen along the axis; (ii) a plurality of arms (e.g., arms <b>46</b>) that are coupled to the valve body at a first axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis (e.g., defined by sites <b>35</b>), each of the arms extending radially outward from the valve body to a respective arm-tip; and (iii) a plurality of ventricular legs (e.g., legs <b>50</b>) that (a) are coupled to the valve body at a second axial level with respect to the longitudinal axis (e.g., defined by coupling points <b>52</b>), the second axial level being downstream of the first axial level, and that (b) extend radially outward from the valve body and toward the plurality of arms;</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0002\" num=\"0214\">a tubular liner (e.g., liner <b>427</b>) that lines the lumen, and that has an upstream end and a downstream end;</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0003\" num=\"0215\">a plurality of prosthetic leaflets (e.g., leaflets <b>58</b>), disposed within the lumen, attached to the liner, and arranged to facilitate one-way upstream-to-downstream fluid flow through the lumen;</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0004\" num=\"0216\">a first sheet of flexible material (e.g., sheet <b>440</b>), the first sheet having (i) a greater perimeter, and (ii) a smaller perimeter that defines an opening, the first sheet being attached to the plurality of arms with the opening aligned with the lumen of the valve body; and</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0005\" num=\"0217\">a second sheet of flexible material (e.g., sheet <b>450</b>):\\n        <ul> <li id=\"ul0020-0001\" num=\"0218\">the second sheet having a first perimeter and a second perimeter,</li> <li id=\"ul0020-0002\" num=\"0219\">the first perimeter being attached to the greater perimeter of the first sheet around the greater perimeter of the first sheet,</li> <li id=\"ul0020-0003\" num=\"0220\">the second sheet extending from the first perimeter radially inwards and downstream toward the second perimeter, the second perimeter circumscribing, and attached to, the valve body at a third axial level that is downstream of the first axial level.</li> </ul>\\n        </li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0221\">The first sheet, the second sheet, and the liner define inflatable pouch <b>490</b> therebetween, the first sheet defining an upstream wall of the pouch, the second sheet defining a radially-outer wall of the pouch, and the liner defining a radially-inner wall of the pouch. The apparatus defines a plurality of windows (e.g., windows <b>482</b>) from the lumen into the pouch, each of the windows bounded by the liner at upstream edges of the window, and bounded by the second perimeter and/or belt <b>462</b> at a downstream edge of the window. Each window <b>482</b> is typically discrete\u2014i.e., bounded on all sides, and separate from other windows. For some applications in which downstream edge <b>436</b> of liner <b>427</b> is stitched to ring <b>182</b> of frame <b>230</b>, the most upstream parts of windows <b>482</b> are closer to the upstream end of the implant than are the most downstream parts of arms <b>46</b> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0222\">Typically, and as shown, pouch <b>490</b> circumscribes the valve body of implant <b>420</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0223\">Typically, and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18C</figref>, each window <b>482</b> spans more than one cell of the valve body. This is represented by the multiple instances of reference numeral <b>482</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18C</figref>. For some applications, and as shown, each window spans at least partly of five cells of the valve body. For some such applications, and as shown, each window spans substantially all of two cells (e.g., two cells of row <b>29</b> <i>a</i>) and about half (e.g., 40-60 percent) of each of three cells (e.g., three cells of row <b>29</b> <i>b</i>). Each window <b>482</b> is bounded by liner <b>427</b> at an upstream edge of the window. Typically, and as shown, the upstream edge of each window <b>482</b> is defined at rings <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> of valve frame <b>230</b>, at which region <b>428</b> of liner <b>427</b> is stitched to the valve frame. At the downstream edge of each window, the window is bounded by perimeter <b>452</b>, and also by belt <b>462</b>. Therefore, at the downstream edge of each window <b>482</b>, the window may be considered to be bounded by stitch line <b>465</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0224\">For some applications, the upstream edge of each window <b>482</b> is the shape of a capital letter M, e.g., with the apices of the letter M at upstream end <b>34</b> of the valve body, and with the vertex of the letter M at a site <b>35</b>. Because region <b>428</b> of liner <b>427</b> follows, and is stitched to, the joists of valve frame <b>230</b> at region <b>428</b> of the liner, it is hypothesized by the inventors that this arrangement reinforces the upstream edge of window <b>482</b>, e.g., increasing durability compared to an arrangement in which the upstream edge of the window crosses between joists of the valve frame.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0195\" num=\"0225\">As described hereinabove, sheet <b>440</b> typically covers an upstream side of arms <b>46</b>. Once pouch <b>490</b> has been formed, at least most of each arm <b>46</b> is therefore disposed inside the pouch. As also described hereinabove, sheet <b>440</b> is stitched to arms <b>46</b>. Once pouch <b>490</b> has been formed, the pouch (i.e., the part of the pouch defined by sheet <b>440</b>) is therefore stitched to arms <b>46</b>,</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0196\" num=\"0226\">For some applications, a circumferential stitch line <b>445</b> is used to stitch sheet <b>440</b> to sheet <b>450</b> at a radius smaller than the overall radius of upstream support portion <b>40</b> (i.e., radially inward from the tips of arms <b>46</b>), typically sandwiching arms <b>46</b> between these two sheets. Stitch line <b>445</b> is typically radially aligned with region <b>154</b> and/or wide (and flexible) portion <b>46</b> <i>c </i>of arm <b>46</b>. This typically creates a region <b>484</b> in which the portions of sheets <b>440</b> and <b>450</b> that are disposed radially outward from stitch line <b>445</b> are isolated from pouch <b>490</b>. For such applications, the ends of arms <b>46</b> are therefore typically disposed in region <b>484</b>, and are isolated from pouch <b>490</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0227\">For some applications, and as shown, sheet <b>450</b> is sufficiently baggy that the sheet (e.g., pouch <b>490</b>) may extend radially outward beyond arms <b>46</b>, particularly if uninhibited by tissue of the native valve. This may be achieved by radial dimension d<b>21</b> of sheet <b>450</b> being greater than distance d<b>22</b> between the ends arms <b>46</b> and clefts <b>250</b>. For some applications, dimension d<b>21</b> is more than 30 percent greater (e.g., more than 50 percent greater) than distance d<b>22</b>. For example, dimension d<b>21</b> may be 30-100 percent greater (e.g., 30-80 percent greater, e.g., 40-80 percent greater, such as 50-70 percent greater) than distance d<b>22</b>. As shown, pouch <b>490</b> may extend radially outward beyond arms <b>46</b> irrespective of the presence of stitch line <b>445</b>, which is disposed radially-inward from the ends of arms <b>46</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0198\" num=\"0228\">Regarding the axial position (i.e., the position along the longitudinal axis of implant <b>420</b>) of pouch <b>490</b> and windows <b>482</b>. For some applications, pouch <b>490</b> extends, with respect to the longitudinal axis of implant <b>420</b>, further upstream than the leaflets. That is, for some applications, upstream regions of pouch <b>490</b> (e.g., those closest to prosthetic valve support <b>40</b>) are situated further upstream than even the apex of curved edge <b>456</b> of leaflets <b>58</b>. For some applications, and as shown, each of leaflets <b>58</b> is attached to liner <b>427</b> upstream of windows <b>482</b>. That is, at least the apex of curved edge <b>456</b> of leaflets <b>58</b> is disposed upstream of windows <b>482</b>. Free edge <b>458</b> of each leaflet <b>58</b> is typically disposed downstream of the third axial level\u2014i.e., the axial level at which perimeter <b>452</b> of sheet <b>450</b> is attached to frame assembly <b>222</b>. That is, leaflets <b>58</b> typically extend further downstream than pouch <b>490</b>. For some applications, and as shown, the third axial level (i.e., the axial level at which perimeter <b>452</b> of sheet <b>450</b> is attached to frame assembly <b>222</b>) is upstream of the second axial level (i.e., the axial level at which legs <b>50</b> are attached to the valve body).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0199\" num=\"0229\">It is to be noted that, whereas liner <b>427</b> is disposed on the inside of valve body <b>32</b>, sheet <b>450</b> and belt <b>462</b> are disposed on the outside of the valve body. Axially downstream of windows <b>482</b>, valve body <b>32</b> is typically not lined\u2014i.e., no liner is typically disposed between leaflets <b>58</b> and frame <b>30</b>. However, belt <b>462</b> circumscribes valve body <b>32</b> and serves a similar function to a liner\u2014channeling fluid through the lumen of the valve body.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0200\" num=\"0230\">It is to be noted that projections <b>246</b> are not visible in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18B</figref>. For some applications, and as shown, the projection-length of projections <b>246</b> (e.g., see projection-length d<b>13</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5C</figref>) is such that the projections do not extend further upstream than the tips of arms <b>46</b>. For some applications, and as shown, projections <b>246</b> extend further upstream than the highest part of arms <b>46</b> within concave region <b>152</b>. For some applications, and as shown, projections <b>246</b> extend to an axial height that is between (a) that of the tips of arms <b>46</b>, and (b) that of the highest part of arms <b>46</b> within concave region <b>152</b>. This is illustrated perhaps most clearly in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9A</figref>, which shows inner frame <b>330</b> <i>a, </i>but is applicable to each of the inner frames described herein, mutatis mutandis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0201\" num=\"0231\">Reference is made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 20, and 21A</figref>-C, which are schematic illustrations of implant <b>420</b>, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Pouch <b>490</b> defines an interior space <b>500</b>. For some applications, and as shown, arms <b>46</b> and legs <b>50</b> (e.g., flanges <b>54</b> thereof) narrow pouch <b>490</b> therebetween to form a narrowed portion <b>510</b> of the pouch. Narrowed portion <b>510</b> typically circumscribes valve body <b>32</b> and/or the longitudinal axis of the implant\u2014e.g., the narrowed portion being annular. This thereby defines (i) an inner portion <b>502</b> of the interior space, radially inward from narrowed portion <b>510</b>, and in fluid communication with lumen <b>38</b> of the implant (e.g., via windows <b>482</b>), and (ii) an outer portion <b>504</b> of the interior space, radially outward from the narrowed portion, and in fluid communication with inner portion <b>502</b> via the narrowed portion. At narrowed portion <b>510</b> each leg <b>50</b> (e.g., flange <b>54</b> thereof) typically pushes sheet <b>450</b> (which defines a downstream surface of pouch <b>490</b>) toward sheet <b>440</b> (which defines an upstream surface of the pouch), such as pressing sheet <b>450</b> into contact with sheet <b>440</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0202\" num=\"0232\">Typically, and as shown, arms <b>46</b> and legs <b>50</b> alternate circumferentially. That is, when viewed from above, an arm <b>46</b> is disposed circumferentially on either side of each leg <b>50</b>, and a leg is disposed circumferentially on either side of each arm. This is illustrated for implant <b>22</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1D</figref>, mutatis mutandis. For applications in which arms <b>46</b> and legs <b>50</b> alternate circumferentially, at narrowed portion <b>510</b> each leg <b>50</b> (e.g., flange <b>54</b> thereof) forms a respective bulge <b>506</b> in sheet <b>440</b> (i.e., the upstream surface of pouch <b>490</b>) by pressing sheet <b>450</b> (i.e., the downstream surface of the pouch) against the upstream surface (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18A</figref>). Bulges <b>506</b> are therefore disposed circumferentially between arms <b>46</b>. It is typically the tip of each leg <b>50</b> that presses into sheet <b>450</b>, and therefore bulges <b>506</b> are typically compact (e.g., as opposed to being elongate).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0233\">It is to be noted that narrowed portion <b>510</b> is therefore formed without pouch <b>490</b> being sandwiched directly between arms <b>46</b> and legs <b>50</b>. It is also to be noted that, at narrowed portion <b>510</b>, pouch <b>490</b> is stitched to arms <b>46</b> but not to legs <b>50</b>. For some applications, at narrowed portion <b>510</b>, legs <b>50</b> extend in an upstream direction past arms <b>46</b>. (This can be understood from <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1C</figref>, mutatis mutandis). For some applications, this configuration results in sheet <b>450</b> billowing between legs <b>50</b>, e.g., as indicated by reference numeral <b>508</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18C</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0234\">It is to be noted that the configuration described hereinabove exists in implant <b>420</b> even prior to implantation\u2014i.e., even in the absence of tissue captured between arms <b>46</b> and flanges <b>54</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0235\">For some applications of the invention, narrowed portion <b>510</b> impedes fluid communication between outer portion <b>504</b> and inner portion <b>502</b> (and thereby between the outer portion and the lumen of the implant). It is hypothesized by the inventors that, for some such applications, this advantageously inhibits blood that has entered outer portion <b>504</b>, from exiting the outer portion. During ventricular systole, ventricular pressure forces blood through windows <b>482</b> into pouch <b>490</b> (i.e., inner portion <b>502</b> thereof). At least some of this blood typically enters outer portion <b>504</b>, e.g., due to the relatively high ventricular pressure. It is hypothesized by the inventors that, at least in part due to narrowed portion <b>510</b>, during ventricular diastole, pressure in the opposite direction is insufficient to force as much blood back out of outer portion <b>504</b>. It is further hypothesized by the inventors that, for some applications, this results in a net increase in the volume of blood within outer portion <b>504</b> during each cardiac cycle, e.g., until resistance inhibits further inflation of outer portion <b>504</b>. This is illustrated by the sequence of frames A-F in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, which represent the state of implant <b>420</b> over time. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref> shows blood <b>14</b> entering outer portion <b>504</b> only after inner portion <b>502</b> has become substantially filled (frames C-D), but for some applications blood may begin to enter outer portion <b>504</b> earlier.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0236\">It is hypothesized by the inventors that such a configuration of pouch <b>490</b> further improves paravalvular sealing provided by the pouch. It is further hypothesized by the inventors that, for some applications of the invention, such a configuration of pouch <b>490</b> facilitates the pouch (e.g., outer portion <b>504</b> thereof) conforming to the tissue surrounding implant <b>420</b>, and therefore further facilitating sealing. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21A-C</figref> show implant <b>420</b> disposed at native valve <b>10</b>, when the anatomy of the native valve (e.g., the annulus and/or leaflets) are uneven with respect to the implant. For example, the anatomy itself may be particularly uneven, or the implant may have been implanted at a sub-optimal angle with respect to the anatomy. In the example shown, at a zone <b>520</b> <i>a </i>the anatomy is relatively close to upstream support portion <b>40</b>, whereas at a zone <b>520</b> <i>b, </i>the anatomy is relatively spaced apart from the upstream support portion, e.g., resulting in a gap <b>522</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21A</figref>). Over time (e.g., between ten seconds and one hour), outer portion <b>504</b> fills, in each zone, according to the mechanical constraints of that region (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 21B-C</figref>). In the example shown, in zone <b>520</b> <i>a </i>outer portion <b>504</b> inflates with blood until space between upstream support portion <b>40</b> and the anatomy (e.g., annulus or leaflet tissue) is filled, and the anatomy resists further inflation of the outer portion (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21B</figref>). In zone <b>520</b> <i>b </i>outer portion <b>504</b> continues to inflate with blood because, in this zone, the space between the upstream support portion and the anatomy is larger (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21C</figref>). In this way, it is hypothesized by the inventors that implant <b>420</b> advantageously adapts to the native anatomy, providing improved paravalvular sealing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0207\" num=\"0237\">For some applications, at least one coagulation component <b>530</b> is disposed within outer portion <b>504</b>, and is configured to promote blood coagulation within the outer portion. For some applications, coagulation component <b>530</b> is annular and, within outer portion <b>504</b>, circumscribes the longitudinal axis of the implant. For some applications, coagulation component <b>530</b> comprises a fabric (e.g., comprising polyethylene terephthalate). For some applications, coagulation component <b>530</b> comprises polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g., expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), e.g., in the form of a membrane or ribbon. For some applications, coagulation component <b>530</b> comprises a metallic (e.g., nitinol or stainless steel) wire, membrane, or mesh, covered by a fabric or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. For applications, coagulation component comprises a coagulation-inducing drug coated thereon or embedded therein (e.g., within a fabric). For some applications, coagulation component <b>530</b> comprises pericardial tissue (e.g., bovine or porcine).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0238\">For some applications of the invention, the scope of the invention includes using one or more of the apparatus and techniques described in this patent application in combination with one or more of the apparatus and techniques described in one or more of the following documents, each of which is incorporated herein by reference:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0021-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0022-0001\" num=\"0239\">U.S. patent application Ser.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'This invention relates to a pneumatic pump. This invention has particular application to a pneumatic pump for pumping flowable or semi-flowable waste compositions, chip-entraining spent drilling muds and the like, and for illustrative purposes the invention will be described with reference to this application. However, this invention may find use in other applications such as continuous-phase liquids, non-homogeneous particulate-solids-in-liquids compositions, and flowable particulate solids per se such as grain. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the referenced prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere. \\n     Pneumatic pumps may be used for pumping flowable compositions in hot or chemically and physically aggressive environments. The compositions may be intractable to rotary, piston and diaphragm pumps, or may be in or of environments where motive means such as internal combustion (IC) or electric motors cannot be used. The general configuration of a pneumatic pump comprises a pressure vessel cyclically transitioned between an intake cycle where compressed air is used to lower the internal pressure of the vessel by venturi effect to draw material in and a discharge cycle where the venturi is stalled or choked to pressurize the vessel and expel the material. \\n     General principles of operation must be optimised for the pneumatic apparatus to be practical and/or efficient. Efficiency may demand that the delivery and/or inlet ports to the pressure vessel are controlled by gates. Control means may control timing of venturi cycle between vacuum and pressure phases, and control operation of any gate on the inlet and outlet. Control means may respond to time or charge mass to optimize cycle volumes. Efficient pumping of highly heterogenous material including a relatively large proportion of solids may be particularly challenging. \\n     Conventional configurations of pressure vessels of pneumatic pumps usually include that the vessel is in the form of a solid of rotation to resist distortion under pressure, locates the material outlet at the lowest point to maximize gravity assistance, and spatially separates the inlet and the outlet. For example, the pressure vessel may comprise a vertical-axis vessel having a conical lower portion and a domed upper portion, wherein the inlet is toward the top of the vessel and the outlet is toward the bottom. In other embodiments a horizontal-axis vessel may comprise a dome-ended cylinder with the inlet and outlet separated both horizontally and vertically. \\n     Existing designs may work well, at least for some applications, for large scale apparatus, but there can be difficulty associated with scaling down designs for portability. The shape of conventional designs may not admit of a compact package. The size of inlets and outlets (confined by the materials) may not scale down as far as the size of the pressure vessel by proportions, resulting in volumetric inefficiency. \\n     Achieving efficient pumping of highly heterogenous material including abundant solids can be particularly challenging. The potential for blockage and/or infective closure of gates or valves that may be incorporated into inlet and/or outlet arrangements is a significant difficulty that can be encountered in the context of pumping highly heterogenous material using pneumatic pumps, \\n     SUMMARY \\n     This invention in a first aspect resides broadly in a pneumatic pump including: \\n     a pressure vessel having a lower transfer port and an upper ventilation port; \\n     a transfer assembly communicating with said transfer port and including an inlet for pumpable material, and a delivery outlet, one or both of said inlet and said outlet having a valve facilitating selective flow therethrough; \\n     a venturi assembly having a suction side communicating with said ventilation port and a closable exhaust vent selectively operable to cycle said ventilation port between a suction phase and a pressurized phase; and \\n     a controller adapted to selectively close the exhaust vent. \\n     Suitably, the venturi assembly of the pneumatic pump is a compressed gas-operated venturi assembly, Suitably, the venturi assembly is a compressed air-operated venturi assembly. \\n     The pneumatic pump of the first aspect may suitably include a supporting frame, for supporting the pressure vessel. The supporting frame may take the form of a portable or transportable frame of metal or the like. The supporting frame may support all of the components of the apparatus as an assembly, whereby only fluid connections are required to put the assembly into service. The supporting frame may include roll-over or other in-service protection, such as roll-over bars, cage components or the like. The supporting frame may be provided with lifting points or adaptations for forklifting. The supporting frame for smaller installations may comprise a tubular steel frame, typically of all-welded construction. \\n     The pressure vessel may be formed principally from any suitable material including but not limited to metal or reinforced polymer. The pressure vessel may be of any conventional shape. However, it has been determined that for smaller devices a spherically-derived shape can be desirable. Especially it has been empirically determined that the best compromise between useful volume, small overall size, and width to height ratio is provided by using a pressure vessel in the form of a disc, essentially a sphere flattened in the vertical plane to be taller and longer in the supporting frame than it is wide. Such a pressure vessel may have a narrow dimension selected to enhance access to relatively narrow industrial spaces. \\n     The transfer port may penetrate the pressure vessel at any relatively lower position but is typically at or near a lowest point. The transfer port may penetrate the pressure vessel in any orientation. For example, a conical lower portion may advantageously include a transfer port oriented on the substantially vertical axis in the manner of a hopper chute. In the case of the spherical or disc-like pressure vessel the penetration of the transfer port may be either parallel to the disc axis (through the flattened side wall) or substantially perpendicular to the vertical plane containing disc axis (substantially tangential to the annular rim of the disc). \\n     The transfer assembly may comprise a conduit extending from the transfer port. The conduit may include a T-connection with side branch connection substantially adjacent the transfer port and an axial connection adjacent the side branch connection. In an alternative, the conduit of the transfer assembly may comprise a Y-connection. In the case of a T-connection the side branch may comprise the inlet and the axial branch may comprise the outlet for the minor efficiency benefit conferred by this arrangement. The inlet and the outlet may be configured with quick-release coupling means such as cam-lock couplings. \\n     Suitably, one or both of the inlet and outlet are fitted with a valve facilitating selective flow therethrough, with the choice determined at least in part by the application. The valve of the inlet and/or outlet may be a passive valve or an active valve. \\n     In embodiments of the pneumatic pump wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is a passive valve, the passive valve may be a non-return valve. The passive valve may be a swing valve. In some embodiments, the passive operation of the swing valve may be enhanced by a closure-assist mechanism. For example, the swing valve may be positively assisted and maintained in a closed position as part of a swing valve apparatus as hereinbelow described. \\n     In some practical applications the inlet will be connected to a material source delivered by a head of pressure. In this instance the apparatus may be fitted with just an outlet passive valve, such as a non-return valve, to resist aspiration of contents from a delivery line downstream of the outlet on the vacuum phase of the venturi. In other applications the inlet may be fitted with a non-return valve to reduce the reflux of pressure vessel contents back up a supply conduit connected to the inlet during the pressure phase of the venturi. Efficiency may be optimized by fitting a non-return valve to both of the inlet and the outlet. \\n     In the application of pumping non-homogeneous materials, passive valves, such as swing valves, may suffer from a statistical distribution of cycles where closure is incomplete. For said application, the use of an active valve or valves may be desirable. Alternatively, if a passive valve is to be used, a closure-assisted swing valve as present in a swing valve apparatus as herein described may be suitable. \\n     In embodiments wherein a closure-assisted swing valve is present, the swing valve may be positively assisted and maintained in a closed position by a valve actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is a linear actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is of a swing valve apparatus, as hereinbelow described. Operation of the valve actuator may be controlled in concert with the closable exhaust vent of the pneumatic pump. \\n     In embodiments of the pneumatic pump wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is an active valve, suitably, the valve is actively convertible between an open configuration wherein flowable substance can pass therethrough, and a closed configuration wherein flowable substances is prevented or at least substantially constrained from passing therethrough. \\n     Suitably, the valve is convertible between an open and a closed position using a valve actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is a rotary actuator. In embodiments, the actuator is of a rotatable valve apparatus, as hereinbelow described. Operation of the actuator may be controlled in concert with the closable exhaust vent of the pneumatic pump. \\n     The active valve may be a rotatable valve, such as a quarter-turn valve. In embodiments, the rotatable valve is a ball valve. In typical embodiments, the ball valve is a two-way ball valve. In alternative embodiments, the active valve may be a knife gate valve. \\n     Typically, in embodiments wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is an active valve, the pneumatic pump comprises a first active valve fitted with, or incorporated as or as part of, the inlet, and a second active valve fitted with, or incorporated as or as part of, the outlet. In embodiments, the first and second active valves are operatively connected such that when the first active valve is in an open position the second active valve is in a closed position, and when the first active valve is in a closed position the second active valve is in an open position. \\n     The venturi assembly of the pneumatic pump of this aspect may comprise an elongate venturi body comprising a venturi orifice interposed between the suction side communicating with said ventilation port and the closable exhaust vent. The closable exhaust suitably comprises a closure mechanism. The orifice may cooperate with a constant-flow gas, such as air, jet supplied by an external compressed gas, such as air, source to induce depression in the suction side of the body upstream of the jet. During the suction phase the open closure mechanism may allow the venturi exhaust to vent through a diffuser and/or muffler. Suitably, the diffuser and/or muffler constrains or prevents air screech, which may otherwise occur at relatively high decibels. \\n     The closure mechanism of the closable exhaust vent may take any form consistent with allowing substantially open flow of venturi exhaust during the suction phase, and allowing sufficient occlusion of venturi exhaust during the pressurized phase. The closure mechanism may be selected from butterfly valves, gate valves, iris valves, slide valves and ball valves. The closure mechanism may be selected to provide an opening cross section substantially the same as or bigger than the cross section of the venturi orifice. The valve closure mechanism may be selected to have low inertia and/or be balanced to enhance speed of action. \\n     The closure mechanism of the closable exhaust vent may be operated by a suitable closure actuator. A pneumatic closure actuator may be desirable given a suitable source of compressed gas, such as air, and the potential lack of useful electrical power in some operating environments. The closure actuator may comprise a rotary actuator or a linear actuator. The closure actuator may be a single-action actuator cycling against a return spring or may comprise a double-action actuator, typically depending on the operating parameters of the controller. \\n     The controller of the pneumatic pump may comprise a digital-electronic over electric or pneumatic control mechanism, an analogue air over electric or pneumatic control mechanism. In order to provide for an air-only system, an air control over air deliver system may be used. For example, a combination of air solenoids and delay-dashpots may be used to provide for simple time-dependent cyclic control. Alternatively an air-analogue programmable logic controller may be used. \\n     The energy of the venturi exhaust air may be used to optimise delivery line performance by being injected to the delivery line downstream of an outlet non-return valve. For example, the venturi exhaust air may be selectively passed through a two-way valve whereby one-way vents to atmosphere and the alternative way vents into the material outlet downstream of a non-return valve. The two-way valve may for example comprise a ball-tee valve. The two-way valve may be manual, remote-controlled, or demand operated by a condition-responsive mechanism. \\n     While the working venturi is typically straight, the body upstream of the jet and orifice may be a curved conduit connected to the ventilation port, whereby the venturi and exhaust axis may be directed in a straight line toward the material outlet despite lack of clear line of sight between the ventilation port and the material outlet. \\n     As described above, in some embodiments, the inlet and/or outlet of the pneumatic pump may be equipped with passive valves, such as swing valves, that are closure assisted, such as to alleviate tendency to fouling. In a second aspect there is provided a swing valve apparatus including: \\n     a valve body having a swing chamber interposed between a valve inlet and a valve outlet; \\n     an annular valve seat located in said swing chamber about an opening into said valve inlet; \\n     a valve gate pivotally mounted in said chamber and adapted to move between a closed position substantially occluding said opening and an open position whereby fluid may pass from said valve inlet to said valve outlet; and \\n     a valve closer mechanism operable to selective urge and maintain said valve gate in said closed position. \\n     The valve gate may comprise a valve closure disc portion adapted to cooperate with the annular valve seat and a body portion pivoted to the walls of the chamber extension. The body portion may include a mechanism to assist with valve closer, associated with the chamber extension. For example, the body portion may include a surface that a selectively operated closer mechanism may cooperate with to effect closure and maintenance of the valve gate on the closed position. \\n     In the case of the pumps described above, a valve gate assembly may comprise a supporting body pivoted to the walls of the chamber extension and having a front surface that mounts a resilient valve closure disc with, for example, a bolt and spreader washer. The front surface may lie in a plane that includes the pivotal axis of the valve gate. The supporting body may have a back surface adapted to cooperate with the valve closer means. \\n     The valve closer mechanism may comprise a linear actuator that is adapted to utilize the transverse extension and is mounted to present a push rod adapted to pass closely adjacent the back or body portion surface. In order that there be provided an initial closing force the back or body portion surface may include a camming surface portion that the pushrod will first contact if the valve is not fully closed. \\n     In one embodiment of the present invention the swing valve is for use on the inlet side of a pump in accordance with the present invention and may include a valve closer assembly including a double acting pneumatic linear actuator mounted coaxially with and closing the top end of a swing valve chamber extension. The actuator may include a push rod adapted to engage a body surface portion of a valve gate having a camming surface at the point of first contact of the push rod with the valve gate and closure maintenance portion engaged on substantially full closure. \\n     As described above the inlet and/or outlet of the pneumatic pump may comprise an active valve, typically a rotatable valve, such as a ball valve. In a third aspect there is provided a rotatable valve apparatus including: \\n     first and second valve bodies having respective rotation chambers interposed between respective valve body inlets and valve body outlets; \\n     first and second rotatable valves located within the respective rotation chambers; and \\n     a valve actuator connected with the first and second rotatable valves, wherein the valve actuator is convertible between; \\n     a first configuration wherein the first rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the first valve body inlet and the first valve body outlet, and the second rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the second valve body inlet and the second valve body outlet; and \\n     a second configuration wherein the second rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the second valve body inlet and the second valve body outlet, and the first rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the first valve body inlet and the first valve body outlet. \\n     In embodiments, the rotatable valve apparatus comprises an intermediate body located between the first valve body and the second valve body. Suitably, the intermediate body is engaged with the first valve body outlet and the second valve body inlet. Suitably, when the valve actuator is in the first configuration, flowable substance can pass through the first valve body outlet to the intermediate body. Suitably, when the valve actuator is in the second configuration, flowable substance can pass from the intermediate body through the second valve body inlet. \\n     Suitably, conversion of the valve actuator between the first configuration and the second configuration rotates the first and second rotatable valves between respective open and closed positions. \\n     In embodiments, the valve actuator is a pneumatic actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator of the rotatable valve apparatus is a rotatable actuator. The valve actuator may comprise a rotatable shaft, wherein the shaft is rotated during conversion of the actuator between the first configuration and the second configuration. Suitably, rotation of the rotatable shaft in a first direction towards the second configuration rotates the first rotatable valve from the open position towards the closed position and rotates the second rotatable valve from the closed position towards the open position; and rotation of the rotatable shaft in a second direction towards the first configuration rotates the first rotatable valve from the closed position towards the open position and the second rotatable valve from the open position towards the closed position. \\n     In embodiments, the rotatable valve apparatus comprises a first arm connecting the rotatable shaft of the valve actuator with the first rotatable valve; and a second arm connecting the rotatable shaft of the valve actuator with the second rotatable valve. Suitably, rotation of the rotatable shaft of the valve apparatus rotates the first rotatable valve via the first arm and the second rotatable valve via the second arm. \\n     The valve body or bodies of the swing valve apparatus of the second aspect or the rotatable valve apparatus of the third aspect may be substantially conventional for such valves and may be of bronze, stainless steel, reinforced polymer or other material. The valve inlet and valve outlet may be integrally formed with connector means including but not limited to male or female threaded portions, quick release connectors such as cam-locks, bayonet connections or the like. \\n     In the case of swing valves of the second aspect, in the way of such valve bodies, there is generally provided a chamber extension or turret extending away from the flow axis and through which the valve gate may be pivotally installed the valve body. The chamber extension may include a bore that is substantially perpendicular to the flow path through the valve. \\n     A fourth aspect of the invention provides the pneumatic pump of the first aspect fitted with the swing valve apparatus of the second aspect, or the rotatable valve apparatus of the third aspect. \\n     One embodiment of the fourth aspect provides a pneumatic pump including: \\n     a pressure vessel having a lower transfer port and an upper ventilation port; \\n     a transfer assembly communicating with said transfer port and including an inlet for pumpable material, and a delivery outlet, the inlet incorporating a swing valve assembly facilitating selective flow therethrough; \\n     a venturi assembly having a suction side communicating with said ventilation port and a closable exhaust vent selectively operable to cycle said ventilation port between a suction phase and a pressurized phase; and \\n     a controller adapted to selectively close the exhaust vent, \\n     wherein the swing valve assembly includes: \\n     a valve body forming at least part of the pneumatic pump inlet, the valve body including a swing chamber interposed between a valve inlet and a valve outlet; \\n     an annular valve seat located in said swing chamber about an opening into said valve inlet; \\n     a valve gate pivotally mounted in said chamber and adapted to move between a closed position substantially occluding said opening and an open position whereby fluid may pass from said valve outlet inlet to said valve outlet; and \\n     valve actuator operable to selective urge and maintain said valve gate in said closed position, \\n     One embodiment of the fourth aspect provides a pneumatic pump including: \\n     a pressure vessel having a lower transfer port and an upper ventilation port; \\n     a transfer assembly communicating with said transfer port and including an inlet for pumpable material, and a delivery outlet, said inlet and outlet incorporating a rotatable valve assembly facilitating selective flow therethrough; \\n     a venturi assembly having a suction side communicating with said ventilation port and a closable exhaust vent selectively operable to cycle said ventilation port between a suction phase and a pressurized phase; and \\n     a controller adapted to selectively close the exhaust vent, \\n     wherein the rotatable valve assembly includes: \\n     a first valve body forming at least part of the pneumatic pump inlet and a second valve body forming at least part of the pneumatic pump outlet, the first and second valve bodies having respective rotation chambers interposed between respective valve inlets and valve outlets; \\n     first and second rotatable valves located within the respective rotation chambers; and \\n     a valve actuator connected with the first and second rotatable valves, wherein the valve actuator is configurable between: \\n     a first configuration wherein the first rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the first valve inlet and the first valve outlet, and the second rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the second valve inlet and the second valve outlet; and \\n     a second configuration wherein the second rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the second valve inlet and the second valve outlet, and the first rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the first valve inlet and the first valve outlet. \\n     In the preceding embodiments of the fourth aspect, the controller adapted to selectively close the exhaust vent of the venturi of the pneumatic pump may further be adapted to operate the valve actuator. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       The invention will be described with reference to the following non-limiting embodiment as illustrated in the drawings and wherein: \\n         FIG. 1  is a front view of an embodiment of a pneumatic pump apparatus, pneumatic pump  10 A, in accordance with the present invention.

For example, stainless steel WOG 1000 ball valves as manufactured by Unimech Group (Malaysia) under the Arita brand are typical for use according to rotatable apparatus  100 . For illustrative purposes, manufacturer&#39;s information from Arita is set forth in  FIG. 10 . \\n     It will be further understood that valve actuator  150  of rotatable valve apparatus  100  is a pneumatic rotary actuator, as are known in the art. For example, actuator model A092 as manufactured by Wuxi Belef Pneumatic Actuators Co Ltd (China) is typical for use according to rotatable apparatus  100 . Double actuating pneumatic rotary actuators are considered particularly desirable, although without limitation thereto. For illustrative purposes, manufacturers information from Wuxi Belef Pneumatic Actuators is set forth in  FIG. 11 . \\n     While known ball valve and pneumatic rotary actuator components are suitable for use in rotatable valve apparatus  100 , the arrangement and connection of ball valve and pneumatic rotary actuator components is specifically adapted for the purposes of the present invention, as described in detail as follows. \\n     As set out in  FIG. 9 , valve actuator  150  is engaged with actuator shaft  151 , located within shaft casing  152 . Actuator shaft  151  of valve actuator  150  is engaged with actuator shaft lever  153 . \\n     Also set out in  FIG. 9 , valve shafts  131  and  141  of ball valves  130  and  140  are engaged with respective valve levers  133  and  143 . First valve lever  133  and second valve lever  143  are located adjacent shaft channels  114  and  124 , respectively, atop valve body connection pads  132  and  142 . \\n     Valve actuator  150  is connected to ball valve  130  via first arm  160 ; and to ball valve  140  via second arm  170 . More particularly, first arm  160  extends from actuator shaft lever  153  to valve lever  133 ; and second arm  170  extends from actuator shaft lever  153  to valve lever  143 . \\n     The connection of first arm  160  to actuator shaft lever  153  and valve lever  133 , and the connection of second arm  170  to actuator shaft lever  153  and valve lever  143 , are rotatable connections. A bolt extends through aperture  1531  of actuator lever  153 ; aperture  161  at a first end of first arm  160 ; and aperture  171  at a first end of second arm  170 , to rotatably connect actuator lever  153  with first arm  160  and second arm  170 . A bolt extends through aperture  1331  of first valve lever  133 ; and aperture  162  at a second end of first arm  160 , to rotatably connect first valve lever  133  with first arm  160 . A bolt extends through aperture  1431  of second valve lever  143  and aperture  172  at a second end of second arm  170 ; to rotatably connect second valve lever with second arm  170 . \\n     Rotatable valve apparatus  100  also includes support plate  180 , extending from shaft casing  152  to first valve body  110  and second valve body  120 . Support plate  180  is in substantially fixed connection with shaft casing  152  and valve connection pads  132  and  142 . As depicted, support plate  180  is welded to shaft casing  152  and bolted to valve connection pads  132  and  142 . First valve lever  133  is positioned between valve connection pad  132  and support plate  180 . Second valve lever  143  is positioned between valve connection pad  142  and support plate  180 . \\n     As best seen in  FIG. 7 , it will be appreciated that the relative orientation of the ball valve components of rotatable apparatus  100  are opposing. That is, outlet  112  of first valve body  110  is positioned towards outlet  122  of second valve body  120 . The opposing orientation the ball valve components facilitates coordinated opening and closing of ball valves  130  and  140  in use, as described in further detail hereinbelow. \\n     Typical use of pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B, swing valve apparatus  50 , and rotatable valve apparatus  100  will now be described. \\n     Pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B is typically used for pumping of non-homogenous flowable or semi-flowable compositions, such as drilling mud containing drill chips, in an industrial context. Typically, conduits, such as pipes or industrial hoses are connected to inlet assembly  17  and outlet assembly  20 , such as by cam-lock. Broadly, the flowable composition is drawn in through a conduit connected to inlet assembly  17  during a suction phase, and pumped out through a conduit connected to outlet assembly  20  during a pressure phase. \\n     In use, pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B is in the pressure phase when closure assembly  25  is closed, wherein air flow from constant-flow air jet  33  enters ventilation port  15 , pressurising pressure vessel  12 . When pneumatic pump apparatus  10 A/ 10 B is in the pressure phase, flowable substance is urged by pressure through transfer port  14  away from pressure vessel  12 . \\n     In use, pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B is in the suction phase when closure assembly  25  is open, wherein air flow within assembly  22  past closure  25  depressurises pressure vessel  12 . When pneumatic pump apparatus  10 A/ 10 B is in the suction phase, flowable substance is urged by suction through transfer port  14  towards pressure vessel  12 . \\n     It will be understood that, in use, in the pressure phase, outlet  20  will allow flow of flowable substance being pumped by pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B away from pressure vessel  12  and, in the suction phase, inlet assembly  17  will allow flow of flowable substance being pumped by pneumatic pump  10 A/ 10 B towards pressure vessel  12 . \\n     As herein described, one or both of an inlet (such as inlet assembly  17 ) and an outlet (such as outlet assembly  20 ) of pneumatic pumps of the invention, may be fitted with a valve. Additionally, a control arrangement, such as that herein described with reference to  FIG. 3 , may be used to coordinate appropriate opening of valves of the inlet and/or outlet, during the respective pressure and suction phases. \\n     Embodiment  10 A of the pneumatic pump described herein comprises swing valve apparatus  50 , incorporated into inlet assembly  17 . In use, when the pressurisation phase is to commence, the slow-acting (dashpot), push-pull, positive-close actuator  30  positively closes swing valve apparatus  50 , by action of pushrod  72  against back surface  70  of supporting body  62 , wherein valve seat  55  closes swing chamber  52 . On transition to the suction phase, positive-close actuator  30  slightly delays opening of the swing valve gate  17 , allowing vacuum accumulation in the pressure vessel  12 . \\n     Embodiment  10 B of the pneumatic pump described herein includes rotatable valve apparatus  100 , incorporated into inlet assembly  17 ; T-connector  26 ; and outlet assembly  20 . In use, when the pressurisation phase of pneumatic pump  10 B is to commence, valve actuator  150  of rotatable valve apparatus  100  rotates actuator shaft  151  in a first direction, wherein actuator shaft lever  153  rotates in the first direction; ball valve  130  of inlet assembly  17  is rotated via first arm  160 , first valve lever  133 , and first valve shaft  131  into a closed configuration; and ball valve  140  of outlet assembly  20  is rotated via second arm  170 , second valve lever  143 , and second valve shaft  141  into an open position. When the suction phase of pneumatic pump  10 B is to commence, valve actuator  150  of rotatable valve apparatus  100  rotates actuator shaft  151  in a second direction opposite the first direction, wherein ball valve  130  of inlet assembly  17  is rotated via first arm  160 , first valve lever  133 , and first valve shaft  131  into an open configuration, and ball valve  140  of outlet assembly  20  is rotated via second arm  170 , second shaft lever  143 , and second valve shaft  141  into a closed position. \\n     To avoid doubt, it will be understood that rotation of actuator shaft lever  153  in the first or second direction results in rotation of first valve lever  133  and second valve lever  143  in substantially the same direction. \\n     It will be further understood that rotation of first valve lever  133  and second valve lever  143  in the first or second direction results in opposite actions on first ball valve  130  and second ball valve  140 . That is, rotation of first valve lever  133  in the first direction rotates first ball valve  130  towards the closed configuration; and rotation of second valve lever  143  in the first direction rotates second ball valve  140  towards the open configuration. Similarly, rotation of first valve lever  133  in the second direction rotates first ball valve  130  towards the open configuration; and rotation of second valve lever  143  in the second direction rotates second ball valve  140  towards the closed configuration. \\n     In use, pneumatic pump apparatus  10 A as described herein may be housed in a removable housing  74  having an air supply cut-out  75 , an inlet cut-out and an outlet cut-out (not shown). The cover includes bolt holes  77  adapted to secure the cover  74  to the frame  11  at mount tags  80 . It will be appreciated that pneumatic pump apparatus  10 B may be housed in a similar removable housing, if desired. \\n     Pneumatic pumps as herein described have been found to be highly desirable for pumping flowable compositions in industrial settings, wherein an ability to tolerate significant heat, chemical exposure, and/or physical force, both internally from material being pumped, and/or from the external environment, is required. \\n     Embodiments incorporating a rotatable valve apparatus, such as rotatable valve apparatus  100 , have been observed to offer surprising efficacy benefits in some circumstances. In particular, the use of rotatable valve apparatus  100  has been observed to offer significant advantages for pumping of highly heterogenous substances containing relatively large amounts of solid material. For these applications, pneumatic pumps incorporating a rotatable valve apparatus as described herein has offered substantial superiority in terms of continuous pumping at desirable flow rates. Rotatable valve apparatus  100  has been observed to be surprisingly superior for avoiding or limiting blockages and ineffective closure at inlet  17  and outlet  20 . \\n     By way of non-limiting example, one highly heterogenous flowable substance containing relatively large amounts of solid material may be drilling mud or drilling fluid, as is known in the art, comprising solids in the form of drill cuttings and/or rock fragments and the like. \\n     The highly heterogenous substance may comprise at least about 5% solids by volume, inclusive of high gravity solids or the like and/or low gravity solids or the like. In embodiments, the highly heterogenous substance comprises at least 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, or 25% solids by volume. \\n     In this specification, terms such as \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cbelow\u201d; \u201cfront\u201d and \u201cback\u201d; \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d; \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d; \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d, and the like, may be used herein for descriptive purposes. However, it will be understood that embodiments of the apparatus and system can potentially be arranged in various orientations, and that such relative terms are not limiting and may be interchangeable in appropriate circumstances. \\n     In this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms \u201cconnection\u201d, \u201cconnected\u201d, \u201cconnecting\u201d, and the like, are not to be read as limited to direct connections, and may also include indirect connections. For example, unless the context requires otherwise, a stated first component \u201cconnected\u201d to a stated second component may be connected via, through, or by, one or more unstated components. \\n     It will be appreciated that the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are not to be read as singular indefinite articles or as otherwise excluding more than one or more than a single subject to which the indefinite article refers. For example, \u201can\u201d arm includes one arm, one or more arms or a plurality of arms. \\n     In this specification, the terms \u201ccomprises\u201d, \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cincludes\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, and similar terms are intended to mean a non-exclusive inclusion, such that an apparatus, system, or method that comprises a list of elements does not include those elements solely, but may well include other elements not listed. \\n     The above description of embodiments of the invention is provided for purposes of description to one of ordinary skill in the related art. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to a single disclosed embodiment. In some instances, well-known components and/or processes have not been described in detail, so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. \\n     As described, numerous alternatives and variations to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art of the above teaching.

This invention has particular application to a pneumatic pump for pumping flowable or semi-flowable waste compositions, chip-entraining spent drilling muds and the like, and for illustrative purposes the invention will be described with reference to this application. However, this invention may find use in other applications such as continuous-phase liquids, non-homogeneous particulate-solids-in-liquids compositions, and flowable particulate solids per se such as grain.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0001\">BACKGROUND</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that the referenced prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Pneumatic pumps may be used for pumping flowable compositions in hot or chemically and physically aggressive environments. The compositions may be intractable to rotary, piston and diaphragm pumps, or may be in or of environments where motive means such as internal combustion (IC) or electric motors cannot be used. The general configuration of a pneumatic pump comprises a pressure vessel cyclically transitioned between an intake cycle where compressed air is used to lower the internal pressure of the vessel by venturi effect to draw material in and a discharge cycle where the venturi is stalled or choked to pressurize the vessel and expel the material.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">General principles of operation must be optimised for the pneumatic apparatus to be practical and/or efficient. Efficiency may demand that the delivery and/or inlet ports to the pressure vessel are controlled by gates. Control means may control timing of venturi cycle between vacuum and pressure phases, and control operation of any gate on the inlet and outlet. Control means may respond to time or charge mass to optimize cycle volumes. Efficient pumping of highly heterogenous material including a relatively large proportion of solids may be particularly challenging.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Conventional configurations of pressure vessels of pneumatic pumps usually include that the vessel is in the form of a solid of rotation to resist distortion under pressure, locates the material outlet at the lowest point to maximize gravity assistance, and spatially separates the inlet and the outlet. For example, the pressure vessel may comprise a vertical-axis vessel having a conical lower portion and a domed upper portion, wherein the inlet is toward the top of the vessel and the outlet is toward the bottom. In other embodiments a horizontal-axis vessel may comprise a dome-ended cylinder with the inlet and outlet separated both horizontally and vertically.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Existing designs may work well, at least for some applications, for large scale apparatus, but there can be difficulty associated with scaling down designs for portability. The shape of conventional designs may not admit of a compact package. The size of inlets and outlets (confined by the materials) may not scale down as far as the size of the pressure vessel by proportions, resulting in volumetric inefficiency.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Achieving efficient pumping of highly heterogenous material including abundant solids can be particularly challenging. The potential for blockage and/or infective closure of gates or valves that may be incorporated into inlet and/or outlet arrangements is a significant difficulty that can be encountered in the context of pumping highly heterogenous material using pneumatic pumps,</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">This invention in a first aspect resides broadly in a pneumatic pump including:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">a pressure vessel having a lower transfer port and an upper ventilation port;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">a transfer assembly communicating with said transfer port and including an inlet for pumpable material, and a delivery outlet, one or both of said inlet and said outlet having a valve facilitating selective flow therethrough;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">a venturi assembly having a suction side communicating with said ventilation port and a closable exhaust vent selectively operable to cycle said ventilation port between a suction phase and a pressurized phase; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">a controller adapted to selectively close the exhaust vent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">Suitably, the venturi assembly of the pneumatic pump is a compressed gas-operated venturi assembly, Suitably, the venturi assembly is a compressed air-operated venturi assembly.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">The pneumatic pump of the first aspect may suitably include a supporting frame, for supporting the pressure vessel. The supporting frame may take the form of a portable or transportable frame of metal or the like. The supporting frame may support all of the components of the apparatus as an assembly, whereby only fluid connections are required to put the assembly into service. The supporting frame may include roll-over or other in-service protection, such as roll-over bars, cage components or the like. The supporting frame may be provided with lifting points or adaptations for forklifting. The supporting frame for smaller installations may comprise a tubular steel frame, typically of all-welded construction.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">The pressure vessel may be formed principally from any suitable material including but not limited to metal or reinforced polymer. The pressure vessel may be of any conventional shape. However, it has been determined that for smaller devices a spherically-derived shape can be desirable. Especially it has been empirically determined that the best compromise between useful volume, small overall size, and width to height ratio is provided by using a pressure vessel in the form of a disc, essentially a sphere flattened in the vertical plane to be taller and longer in the supporting frame than it is wide. Such a pressure vessel may have a narrow dimension selected to enhance access to relatively narrow industrial spaces.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">The transfer port may penetrate the pressure vessel at any relatively lower position but is typically at or near a lowest point. The transfer port may penetrate the pressure vessel in any orientation. For example, a conical lower portion may advantageously include a transfer port oriented on the substantially vertical axis in the manner of a hopper chute. In the case of the spherical or disc-like pressure vessel the penetration of the transfer port may be either parallel to the disc axis (through the flattened side wall) or substantially perpendicular to the vertical plane containing disc axis (substantially tangential to the annular rim of the disc).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The transfer assembly may comprise a conduit extending from the transfer port. The conduit may include a T-connection with side branch connection substantially adjacent the transfer port and an axial connection adjacent the side branch connection. In an alternative, the conduit of the transfer assembly may comprise a Y-connection. In the case of a T-connection the side branch may comprise the inlet and the axial branch may comprise the outlet for the minor efficiency benefit conferred by this arrangement. The inlet and the outlet may be configured with quick-release coupling means such as cam-lock couplings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">Suitably, one or both of the inlet and outlet are fitted with a valve facilitating selective flow therethrough, with the choice determined at least in part by the application. The valve of the inlet and/or outlet may be a passive valve or an active valve.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">In embodiments of the pneumatic pump wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is a passive valve, the passive valve may be a non-return valve. The passive valve may be a swing valve. In some embodiments, the passive operation of the swing valve may be enhanced by a closure-assist mechanism. For example, the swing valve may be positively assisted and maintained in a closed position as part of a swing valve apparatus as hereinbelow described.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">In some practical applications the inlet will be connected to a material source delivered by a head of pressure. In this instance the apparatus may be fitted with just an outlet passive valve, such as a non-return valve, to resist aspiration of contents from a delivery line downstream of the outlet on the vacuum phase of the venturi. In other applications the inlet may be fitted with a non-return valve to reduce the reflux of pressure vessel contents back up a supply conduit connected to the inlet during the pressure phase of the venturi. Efficiency may be optimized by fitting a non-return valve to both of the inlet and the outlet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">In the application of pumping non-homogeneous materials, passive valves, such as swing valves, may suffer from a statistical distribution of cycles where closure is incomplete. For said application, the use of an active valve or valves may be desirable. Alternatively, if a passive valve is to be used, a closure-assisted swing valve as present in a swing valve apparatus as herein described may be suitable.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">In embodiments wherein a closure-assisted swing valve is present, the swing valve may be positively assisted and maintained in a closed position by a valve actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is a linear actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is of a swing valve apparatus, as hereinbelow described. Operation of the valve actuator may be controlled in concert with the closable exhaust vent of the pneumatic pump.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">In embodiments of the pneumatic pump wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is an active valve, suitably, the valve is actively convertible between an open configuration wherein flowable substance can pass therethrough, and a closed configuration wherein flowable substances is prevented or at least substantially constrained from passing therethrough.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">Suitably, the valve is convertible between an open and a closed position using a valve actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator is a rotary actuator. In embodiments, the actuator is of a rotatable valve apparatus, as hereinbelow described. Operation of the actuator may be controlled in concert with the closable exhaust vent of the pneumatic pump.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">The active valve may be a rotatable valve, such as a quarter-turn valve. In embodiments, the rotatable valve is a ball valve. In typical embodiments, the ball valve is a two-way ball valve. In alternative embodiments, the active valve may be a knife gate valve.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">Typically, in embodiments wherein the valve of the inlet and/or outlet is an active valve, the pneumatic pump comprises a first active valve fitted with, or incorporated as or as part of, the inlet, and a second active valve fitted with, or incorporated as or as part of, the outlet. In embodiments, the first and second active valves are operatively connected such that when the first active valve is in an open position the second active valve is in a closed position, and when the first active valve is in a closed position the second active valve is in an open position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">The venturi assembly of the pneumatic pump of this aspect may comprise an elongate venturi body comprising a venturi orifice interposed between the suction side communicating with said ventilation port and the closable exhaust vent. The closable exhaust suitably comprises a closure mechanism. The orifice may cooperate with a constant-flow gas, such as air, jet supplied by an external compressed gas, such as air, source to induce depression in the suction side of the body upstream of the jet. During the suction phase the open closure mechanism may allow the venturi exhaust to vent through a diffuser and/or muffler. Suitably, the diffuser and/or muffler constrains or prevents air screech, which may otherwise occur at relatively high decibels.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">The closure mechanism of the closable exhaust vent may take any form consistent with allowing substantially open flow of venturi exhaust during the suction phase, and allowing sufficient occlusion of venturi exhaust during the pressurized phase. The closure mechanism may be selected from butterfly valves, gate valves, iris valves, slide valves and ball valves. The closure mechanism may be selected to provide an opening cross section substantially the same as or bigger than the cross section of the venturi orifice. The valve closure mechanism may be selected to have low inertia and/or be balanced to enhance speed of action.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">The closure mechanism of the closable exhaust vent may be operated by a suitable closure actuator. A pneumatic closure actuator may be desirable given a suitable source of compressed gas, such as air, and the potential lack of useful electrical power in some operating environments. The closure actuator may comprise a rotary actuator or a linear actuator. The closure actuator may be a single-action actuator cycling against a return spring or may comprise a double-action actuator, typically depending on the operating parameters of the controller.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">The controller of the pneumatic pump may comprise a digital-electronic over electric or pneumatic control mechanism, an analogue air over electric or pneumatic control mechanism. In order to provide for an air-only system, an air control over air deliver system may be used. For example, a combination of air solenoids and delay-dashpots may be used to provide for simple time-dependent cyclic control. Alternatively an air-analogue programmable logic controller may be used.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">The energy of the venturi exhaust air may be used to optimise delivery line performance by being injected to the delivery line downstream of an outlet non-return valve. For example, the venturi exhaust air may be selectively passed through a two-way valve whereby one-way vents to atmosphere and the alternative way vents into the material outlet downstream of a non-return valve. The two-way valve may for example comprise a ball-tee valve. The two-way valve may be manual, remote-controlled, or demand operated by a condition-responsive mechanism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">While the working venturi is typically straight, the body upstream of the jet and orifice may be a curved conduit connected to the ventilation port, whereby the venturi and exhaust axis may be directed in a straight line toward the material outlet despite lack of clear line of sight between the ventilation port and the material outlet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">As described above, in some embodiments, the inlet and/or outlet of the pneumatic pump may be equipped with passive valves, such as swing valves, that are closure assisted, such as to alleviate tendency to fouling. In a second aspect there is provided a swing valve apparatus including:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">a valve body having a swing chamber interposed between a valve inlet and a valve outlet;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">an annular valve seat located in said swing chamber about an opening into said valve inlet;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">a valve gate pivotally mounted in said chamber and adapted to move between a closed position substantially occluding said opening and an open position whereby fluid may pass from said valve inlet to said valve outlet; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">a valve closer mechanism operable to selective urge and maintain said valve gate in said closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">The valve gate may comprise a valve closure disc portion adapted to cooperate with the annular valve seat and a body portion pivoted to the walls of the chamber extension. The body portion may include a mechanism to assist with valve closer, associated with the chamber extension. For example, the body portion may include a surface that a selectively operated closer mechanism may cooperate with to effect closure and maintenance of the valve gate on the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">In the case of the pumps described above, a valve gate assembly may comprise a supporting body pivoted to the walls of the chamber extension and having a front surface that mounts a resilient valve closure disc with, for example, a bolt and spreader washer. The front surface may lie in a plane that includes the pivotal axis of the valve gate. The supporting body may have a back surface adapted to cooperate with the valve closer means.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">The valve closer mechanism may comprise a linear actuator that is adapted to utilize the transverse extension and is mounted to present a push rod adapted to pass closely adjacent the back or body portion surface. In order that there be provided an initial closing force the back or body portion surface may include a camming surface portion that the pushrod will first contact if the valve is not fully closed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">In one embodiment of the present invention the swing valve is for use on the inlet side of a pump in accordance with the present invention and may include a valve closer assembly including a double acting pneumatic linear actuator mounted coaxially with and closing the top end of a swing valve chamber extension. The actuator may include a push rod adapted to engage a body surface portion of a valve gate having a camming surface at the point of first contact of the push rod with the valve gate and closure maintenance portion engaged on substantially full closure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">As described above the inlet and/or outlet of the pneumatic pump may comprise an active valve, typically a rotatable valve, such as a ball valve. In a third aspect there is provided a rotatable valve apparatus including:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">first and second valve bodies having respective rotation chambers interposed between respective valve body inlets and valve body outlets;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">first and second rotatable valves located within the respective rotation chambers; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">a valve actuator connected with the first and second rotatable valves, wherein the valve actuator is convertible between;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">a first configuration wherein the first rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the first valve body inlet and the first valve body outlet, and the second rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the second valve body inlet and the second valve body outlet; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">a second configuration wherein the second rotatable valve is open and flowable substance can pass between the second valve body inlet and the second valve body outlet, and the first rotatable valve is closed and flowable substance is constrained or prevented from passing between the first valve body inlet and the first valve body outlet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">In embodiments, the rotatable valve apparatus comprises an intermediate body located between the first valve body and the second valve body. Suitably, the intermediate body is engaged with the first valve body outlet and the second valve body inlet. Suitably, when the valve actuator is in the first configuration, flowable substance can pass through the first valve body outlet to the intermediate body. Suitably, when the valve actuator is in the second configuration, flowable substance can pass from the intermediate body through the second valve body inlet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">Suitably, conversion of the valve actuator between the first configuration and the second configuration rotates the first and second rotatable valves between respective open and closed positions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">In embodiments, the valve actuator is a pneumatic actuator. In embodiments, the valve actuator of the rotatable valve apparatus is a rotatable actuator. The valve actuator may comprise a rotatable shaft, wherein the shaft is rotated during conversion of the actuator between the first configuration and the second configuration.

No. 15/856,849 entitled \u201cSYSTEM, APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EYE PROTECTION,\u201d filed on Dec. 28, 2017, which is a continuation of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 to U.S. Pat. No. 9,895,265 entitled \u201cSAFETY APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR USE WITH EYE PROTECTION,\u201d filed on Jun. 30, 2017, the disclosure of each of the preceding is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. \\n    \\n    \\n     BACKGROUND OF INVENTION \\n     1. Field of Invention \\n     This invention relates generally to apparatus, systems and methods for increasing the safety of personnel operating tools and equipment. More specifically, at least one embodiment, relates to systems, apparatus and methods providing improved safety for operators of electrically powered tools and equipment. \\n     2. Discussion of Related Art \\n     More than 800,000 individuals sustain an eye injury annually in U.S. workplaces. Tens or hundreds of thousands of other individuals sustain an eye injury outside of the workplace annually. Workplace eye injuries alone cost an estimated 300 million dollars in lost productivity, medical treatment and worker&#39;s compensation. Frequently, these injuries result from the use of power equipment without eye protection, for example, operation of electrically operated hand tools. \\n     Traditional approaches to eye-safety have developed over time in an effort to reduce eye injuries. For example, systems have been developed to prevent the operation of certain types of medical equipment unless operating personnel are wearing prescribed safety equipment. These and other approaches also employed in industrial settings generally focus on a fixed piece of equipment. Some of these prior approaches are location-based and rely on the fact that the equipment that requires the use of safety equipment will not be moved from the location. \\n     Another approach employs a key lock to lock a switch to the prongs on a plug located at the end of a power cord for a specific piece of equipment. However, application of the preceding is very limited because of the nature of the connection between the lock and a specific type of plug. In addition, an integrated key lock creates a complex mechanical device. Other approaches are directed to an automatic shutoff based on a lack of motion of a piece of equipment. However, these approaches require a physical connection to a sensor included in the piece of electrically operated equipment or employ a device that is included as an integral part of the power cord of the piece of equipment. \\n     SUMMARY OF INVENTION \\n     Therefore, there is a need for apparatus and systems that provide an adaptable safety system that is better suited to the dynamics found in most workplaces. These approaches provide apparatus and systems that provide a safety interlock that is not restricted to a specific location or a specific piece of equipment. Some of these embodiments provide an approach that is much more universal than conventional approaches because the apparatus is designed to secure to the power cords most commonly employed with electrical equipment in the workplace and/or by home hobbyists. According to some further embodiments, a safety apparatus is configured to a secure to the distal end of an extension cord that can be employed with any number of electrically operated pieces of equipment.

The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccomprising,\u201d or \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining\u201d, \u201cinvolving\u201d, and variations thereof herein, is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 1 , a safety device  100  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. The safety device  100  includes a body  102 , a fastening device  104 , a first face  106 , a female socket  108  located in the first face, a male plug  110  and a user interface  112 .  FIG. 1  also illustrates an extension cord  130  including a cord  132  and a female socket  134  located at the distal end of the extension cord  130 . In addition,  FIG. 1  illustrates a power cord  140  including a male plug  136  and a cord  138 . The power cord  140  can be included in an electrically operated hand tool  142 , for example, a circular saw  142 A, a drill  142 B, a router  142 C and a grinder  142 D. One of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure provided herein will recognize the preceding list is non-exhaustive. Thus, while the illustrated embodiment shows a mix of conventional power tools, other hand tools can be employed with the safety device  100 , for example, electrically-operated lawn mowers, hedge trimmers, weed whackers and vacuums to name a few. Further, the electrically-operated equipment can be fixed in place, for example, bench-mounted tools or equipment such as a drill press. \\n     As is described in greater detail below, the safety device  100  includes an electronic system in the body  102  that allows the device  100  to communicate with a pair of safety glasses. In general, the electronic system includes an electrical isolation device to maintain an open circuit in one or more line conductors included in the body  102  to prevent operation of equipment (for example, the power tool  142 ) plugged into the device  102  unless the electronic systems receives information communicated from the safety glasses that indicates the safety glasses are being worn properly. \\n     In various embodiments, the conductors located in the body  102  connect the conductors included in the female socket  108  with the corresponding conductors included in the male plug  110 . For example, in a single phase device, the line conductor included in the male plug  110  is connected to the line conductor in the female socket  108 , the neutral conductor included in the male plug  110  is connected to the neutral conductor in the female socket  108  and the ground conductor included in the male plug  110  is connected to the ground conductor included in the female receptacle  108 . \\n     In various embodiments, the body  102  is manufactured from a material having electrical insulating properties sufficient to maintain electrical isolation between the conductors located in the body  102 . Further, the materials of construction of the body  102  safely insulate the conductors from a user who takes hold of the body  102 . In further embodiments, the required electrical insulation rating is determined based on the voltage rating of the device, for example, 120 VAC, 240 VAC, etc. \\n     The fastening device  104  allows the safety device  100  to receive the cord  140  of the power tool  142  and securely attach the cord  140  to the device  100  with the cord  140  plugged into the female socket  108  located in the face  106 . The male plug  110  is an integral part of the safety device  100  and is configured to plug into the distal end of the extension cord  130 . According to the illustrated embodiment, the fastening device  104  includes a fastener  116 , a first wall  118  and a second wall  119 . In the illustrated embodiment, the first wall  118  and the second wall  119 , respectively, are hingedly attached to the body  102  such that they are moved apart to place the fastening device  104  in an open position. To place the fastening device  104  in the closed position, the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  are moved together to place the respective distal ends of walls  118 ,  119  adjacent to one another. According to the illustrated embodiment, the respective distal ends of walls  118 ,  119  are secured to one another by the fastener  116 . According to the illustrated embodiment, the fastener  116  includes two screws. As is described in greater detail below, other fastening structure can be used alone or in combination with a mechanical fastener. \\n     The user interface  112  can vary depending on the embodiment. According to the illustrated embodiment, the user interface  112  provides two indicating lamps, for example, a red indicating lamp and a green indicating lamp (e.g., LEDs). In one embodiment, the red indicating lamp provides a status indication concerning the state of the electrical isolation device and the green indicating lamp provides an indication of whether the safety device  100  is connected to an active source of electricity. According to this embodiment, the green indicating lamp is on when the safety device  100  is connected to an active (i.e., \u201cenergized\u201d) electrical circuit, for example, with the extension cord  130  connected and plugged into an energized source of electricity. The red indicating lamp is on with the electrical isolation device is closed as a result of the proper use of the safety glasses associated with the device  100 . In another embodiment, the red lamp can indicate that the electrical isolation device is in a first state that prevents current flow between the male plug  110  to the female socket  108 . The green lamp can indicate that the electronic system has placed the electrical isolation device in a second state to permit current flow between the male plug  110  to the female socket  108 . In one embodiment, the change of state is a result of feedback from the safety glasses concerning whether the safety glasses are being worn properly. \\n     The user interface can include different elements either alone or in combination with indicating lamps depending on the embodiment. Thus, the user interface  112  can include one or more switches or pushbuttons, for example, to allow a user to turn the electronic system included in the safety device \u201con\u201d or to activate a wireless communication system included in the safety device  100 . The user interface  112  can also include additional or different indicating lamps. In one embodiment, the user interface  112  includes an indicating lamp that identifies when the wireless communication system included in the safety device  100  is in communication with a wireless communication system included in the safety glasses. For example, the indicating lamp can turn on when the communications systems of the safety device and the safety glasses are \u201cpaired\u201d for communication with one another. According to still another embodiment, the user interface includes a speaker to provide an audio output that can provide feedback to the user regarding the operating status of the safety system including the safety device  100  and/or the status one or more features included in the device  100 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 2 , a safety system  200  including the safety device  100  with a pair of safety glasses  150  is illustrated in an embodiment in which the device  100  and glasses  150  are configured to wirelessly communicate with one another. According to the illustrated embodiment, the safety glasses  150  include an electronic apparatus  152 . As is described in greater detail herein, the electronic apparatus  152  can include one or more sensors to detect whether the safety glasses are being worn properly.  FIG. 2  illustrates the user interface  112  and an electrical isolation device  114 . Other elements of the electronic system included the body are described below with reference to  FIG. 5 .  FIG. 2  also illustrates a first hinge  120 , a second hinge  121  and a face  109  which is included in the body. According to this embodiment, the male plug  110  extends from the face  109 . \\n     According to some embodiments, the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  are hingedly connected to the body  102  on opposite sides of the body from one another. The first wall  118  is attached to the body at the first hinge  120  while the second wall  119  is attached to the body at the second hinge  121 . According to other embodiments, only a single hinge can be employed where, for example, only one wall of the fastening device pivots while a second wall remains substantially fixed in place. In this embodiment, a position of the single movable wall is adjusted to move the fastening device between the open position and the closed position. According to still another embodiment, hinges are not employed in any of the walls of the fastening device. According to this embodiment, the shape and materials of construction of the fastening device provide a natural resiliency that allows the fastening device to be moved between the open position and the closed position by deformation of the walls. This resiliency causes the distal ends of the walls of the fastening device to \u201cspring\u201d apart from one another when the fastener  116  releases the respective distal ends of the walls from engagement with one another. Further, while  FIG. 2  illustrates a configuration in which the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  are attached to opposing sides of the body, other relative orientations of the two walls  118 ,  119  can be employed provided that they allow the power cord  140  to be secured to the safety device  100  by the fastening device  104 . \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 2 , the safety device  100  is connected to each of the extension cord  130  and the power cord  140 . The male plug  110  is connected to the distal end of the extension cord  130  such that the face  109  meets a corresponding face of the extension cord. The power cord  140  is received in a cavity formed in the fastening device  104  when the fastening device is placed in the closed position. In particular, the male plug  136  is received in the cavity and the cord  138  extends from the cavity via an opening located at the distal end of the fastening device  104 . \\n     According to various embodiments, the electronic apparatus  152  detects a status of the safety glasses to determine whether the safety glasses are being worn properly. For example, the electronic apparatus  152  can include one or more switches, biometric sensors and/or inertial sensors used alone, in combination with one another or in combination with other devices to determine whether the safety glasses are being worn properly. \\n     In operation, the safety system  200  ensures that a user is properly wearing the safety glasses  150  before the isolation device  114  is placed in a state in which the female socket  108  is energized such that the equipment connected by the power cord  140  can be operated. For example, where a proximate end of the extension cord  130  is plugged into an energized wall outlet and the male plug  110  is plugged into the socket located at a distal end of the extension cord  130  electricity is present at the safety device  100 . If the safety glasses  150  are not being worn, the safety device  100  receives a signal from the electronic apparatus  152  indicating that the glasses  150  are not being worn. Based on that information, the safety device  100  is placed in a first state in which the isolation device  114  maintains the female socket  108  in a de-energized state, for example, by preventing current flow from the male plug  110  to the female socket  108 . When the safety glasses  150  are being worn, the electronic apparatus  152  wirelessly communicates the updated status to the safety device  100 . In response, the safety device  100  is placed in a second state in which the isolation device operates to allow current flow from the male plug  110  to the female socket  108  thereby energizing the female socket  108 . As a result, the equipment connected to the power cord  140  can now be operated by the user. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 3A , the safety device  100  is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments. According to this embodiment, the fastening device  104  is located to securely attach to the power cord of a piece of electrically operated equipment. As mentioned above, the electrically operated equipment can include portable equipment that is freely moved about by a user (for example, an electrically-operated hand drill) or a fixed piece of equipment (for example, a drill press). In the illustrated embodiment, the fastening device  104  includes the first side wall  118  and the second side wall  119  in an arrangement in which they are pivotably attached to the body  102  and operate like a set of jaws to move between the open position and the closed position in which the power cord is secured to the body  102 . \\n     Details concerning the female socket  108  are also illustrated in  FIG. 3A . In the illustrated embodiment, the female socket  108  includes a line-conductor socket  108 A, a neutral-conductor socket  108 B and a ground-conductor socket  108 C. Each of these sockets is connected to a corresponding prong included in the male plug  110 . According to the illustrated embodiment, the male plug  110  includes a line conductor  111 A, a neutral conductor  111 B and a ground conductor  111 C. In the preceding arrangement, the line-conductor socket  108 A is connected to the line conductor  111 A, the neutral-conductor socket  108 B is connected to the neutral conductor  111 B and the ground-conductor socket  108 C is connected to the ground conductor  111 C. According to a further embodiment, the isolation device (for example, the isolation device  114  illustrated in  FIG. 2 ) is connected in series within the body between the line-conductor socket  108 A and the line conductor  111 A. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 3B , a top view of the safety device  100  and the power cord  140  are illustrated with the device  100  and the power cord  140  located in positions adjacent to one another. The power cord  140  includes a face  141  located at a distal end of the plug  136 . A set of conductors  139  extends from the face  141 . The set of conductors  139  includes a line conductor, a neutral conductor and a ground conductor arranged in a conventional layout that allows the socket  108  to receive the conductors  139 . The plug  136  includes dimensions including a width W 1  and a length L 1 . The cord  138  includes an outside diameter OD 1 . \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 3A-3B , the fastening device  104  includes a first distal end  123  located at a distal end of the first wall  118 . The fastening device  104  also includes a second distal end  124  located at a distal end of the second wall  119 . A first proximate end  125  is located at a proximate end of the first wall  118 . A second proximate end  126  is located at a proximate end of the second wall  119 .  FIG. 3B  illustrates the fastening device in the closed position in which the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  are pivoted together such that the first distal end  123  and the second distal end  124  are located adjacent to one another. According to some embodiments, the first distal end  124  and the second distal end  125  are in contact with one another with the fastening device  104  in the closed position. \\n     Although embodiments illustrated herein show the use of a mechanical fastener (for example, the fastener  116 ), other fastening structure can be provided to secure the first distal end  123  to the second distal end  124  according to alternate embodiments. For example, a latch can be integrally formed as a feature of the first distal end  123  and the second distal end  124 . According to this embodiment, the latch can securely fasten the respective distal ends  123 ,  124  to one another when the fastening device  104  is moved to the closed position. Where the fastening device  104  is formed of a plastic material, for example, injection molded, one or more elements of the latch can be molded into the first distal end  123  with corresponding features molded into the second distal end  124  to provide a snap-fit closure. In other embodiments, the fastening device  104  can include a fastening element on one of the distal ends  118 ,  119  that moves into engagement by looping that fastening element over the other distal end. \\n     According to some embodiments, the fastening device  104  can include a feature that provides a suitable structure to attach a padlock that prevents the fastening device from being opened when the padlock is secured to the attachment structure. For example the first distal end  123  can include a first opening designed to receive a shackle of a padlock and the second distal end  124  can include a second opening designed to receive the shackle. According to one embodiment, the first opening and the second opening can extend in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the safety device  100 . In operation, the distal ends  123 ,  124  are moved proximate to one another such that the two openings are aligned. The shackle is then slid through the two openings and the padlocked is closed to lock it. The preceding effectively secures the first wall  118  to the second wall  119  and places the fastening device in the closed position. The power cord  140  can be effectively locked to the safety device  100  in this embodiment. In other embodiments illustrated herein, conventional hand tools can be employed to secure the fastening device in the closed position. \\n     According to the illustrated embodiment, a cavity  115  is formed in a central region of the fastening device  104 . The cavity  115  has a width W 2  and a length L 2 . The width W 2  is an interior dimension measured between the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  with the fastening device  104  in the closed position. The length L 2  is an interior dimension measured between the face  106  and distal ends  123 ,  124  with the fastening device  104  in the closed position. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 3C , further details of the fastening device  104  are illustrated in a rear view provided in the direction in which the power cord  140  is plugged into the safety device  100 .  FIG. 3C  illustrates the fastening device in the closed position. According to this embodiment, an opening  122  is formed between the first distal end  123  and the second distal end  124  with the fastening device  104  closed. The opening includes an inside diameter ID 1  located to capture the cord  138  in the opening when the fastening device  104  is closed. \\n     Each of the cavity  115  and the opening  122  are sized and configured to allow the fastening device  104  to receive the power cord  140  and fasten the power cord  140  to the safety device  100  when the power cord is plugged into the female socket  108 . For example, the width W 2  of the cavity  115  is sized relative to the width W 1  of the plug  136  to allow the cavity  115  to receive the plug  136  while still allowing the fastening device  104  to close and fasten to the power cord  140 . Similarly, the length L 2  of the cavity  115  is sized relative to the length L 1  of the plug  136  to allow the cavity  115  to receive the plug  136  and allow the fastening device  104  to close thereby allowing the fastening device  104  to secure the safety device  100  the power cord  140 . In addition to the preceding, a shape of the cavity  115  is also selected to accommodate the plug  136  within the fastening device  104  with the fastening device in the closed position. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  each include a taper that brings the two walls together at the distal end. In one embodiment, the taper of the two walls  118 ,  119  is shaped to conform to the taper found at a transition from the plug  136  to the cord  138  of the power cord  140 . \\n     The ID 1  of the opening  122  is sized to allow the cord  138  included in the power cord  140  to extend outside the cavity  115 . According to the illustrated embodiment, the ID 1  of the opening  122  is sized slightly larger than the OD 1  of the cord  138 . A proper sizing of the ID 1  of the opening  122  relative to the OD 1  of the cord  138  also allows the first distal end  123  and the second distal end  124  to meet properly to secure the two ends together with the fastening device  104  in the closed position. \\n     To provide wide adaptability, the dimensions (W 2 , L 2 ) and shape of the cavity  115  can be provided based on the dimensions and shapes of the power cords found in certain types of equipment (for example, vacuums) or the dimensions and shapes of power cords found in a particular brand of power tool. Electrically-operated hand tools are generally operated using 120 VAC circuits rated at 15 or 20 Amps. The conductor size and insulation ratings of the power cords are standardized based on the operating voltage and current ratings of the power source and the power requirements of the tool. Consequently, the ID 1  of the opening  122  can be sized and adapted to receive a cord having an OD most often employed among common hand tools. \\n     In operation, the fastening device  104  is placed in the open position by spreading the first wall  118  apart from the second wall  119 , for example, as shown in  FIG. 1 . The power cord  140  is then positioned to align the set of conductors  139  with the female socket  108  and the power cord  140  is plugged into the safety device  100  to bring the face  106  into contact with the face  141 . The first wall  118  and the second wall  119  are then moved together to bring the first distal end  123  into contact with the second distal end  124 . With the first distal end  118  attached to the second distal end  119  the plug  136  is secured within the cavity  115  and the cord  138  extends through the opening  122 . \\n     While the illustrated embodiment, shows that the top and bottom of the cavity  115  are open other approaches can be used. For example, the first wall  118  and the second wall  119  can each wrap 180 degrees around the cavity  115 . According to this embodiment, an internal diameter provided by the cavity is sized to receive ad fully enclose the plug  136  when it is plugged in the female socket  108  and the fastening device  104  is in the closed position. \\n       FIGS. 4A-4C  illustrate another embodiment of a safety device  400 . A difference between the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 4A-4C  and the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 3A-3C  is that the fastening device of the safety device  400  is oriented and configured to fasten to the distal end of the extension cord  130 . In many other respects, the features of the safety device  400  are similar to those found in the safety device  100 . As a result, some of the features and functionality common to each embodiment are not repeated in full in the following description. \\n     The safety device  400  includes a body  402 , a fastening device  404 , a first face  406  and a second face  409 .

The distal end  424  includes second fastening structure  446 . In the illustrated embodiment, the fastening device includes a pair of fasteners  416 , for example, screws or bolts. According to this embodiment, the first fastening structure  444  includes a pair of threaded holes sized and configured to receive the pair of fasteners  416  in a threaded engagement. Further, the second fastening structure  446  includes unthreaded holes sized and configured to allow the pair of fasteners  416  to slide through the holes. According to alternate embodiments, other fastening structure can be used as described above concerning the safety device  100 , for example, snaps or clips integral to the walls  418 ,  419 , or additional hardware to assist in maintaining the fastening device in the closed position. Conductors internal to the body  402  connect the conductors located in the female socket (not illustrated) to the conductors located in the male plug  410 . \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 4B , a top view of the safety device  400  and the extension cord  130  are illustrated with the device  400  and the extension cord  130  located in positions adjacent to one another. The extension cord  130  includes a face  131  located at a distal end of the cord  130 . The conductors included in the extension cord  130  are accessible in the face  131  of the female socket  134 . For example, the female socket  134  can include a line conductor, a neutral conductor and a ground conductor arranged in a conventional layout that allows the socket  134  to receive conductors provided by the male plug  410 . The female socket  130  includes dimensions including a width W 3  and a length L 3 . The cord  132  includes an outside diameter OD 2 . \\n     According to the illustrated embodiment, a cavity  415  is formed in a central region of the fastening device  404 . The cavity  415  has a width W 4  and a length L 4 . The width W 4  is an interior dimension measured between the first wall  418  and the second wall  419  with the fastening device  404  in the closed position. The length L 4  is an interior dimension measured between the face  406  and distal ends  423 ,  424  with the fastening device  404  in the closed position. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 4C , further details of the fastening device  404  are illustrated in a rear view provided in the direction in which the safety device  100  is plugged into the extension cord  130 .  FIG. 4C  illustrates the safety device  400  with the fastening device  404  in the closed position. According to this embodiment, an opening  422  is formed between the first distal end  423  and the second distal end  424  with the fastening device  404  closed. The opening  422  includes an inside diameter ID 2  located to capture the cord  132  in the opening when the fastening device  404  is closed. \\n     Each of the cavity  415  and the opening  422  are sized and configured to allow the fastening device  404  to receive the extension cord  130  and fasten the extension cord  130  to the safety device  400  when the safety device  400  is plugged into the female socket  134 . For example, the width W 4  of the cavity  115  is sized relative to the width W 3  of the female socket  134  to allow the cavity  415  to receive the socket  134  while still allowing the fastening device  404  to close and fasten to the extension cord  130 . Similarly, the length L 4  of the cavity  415  is sized relative to the length L 3  of the female socket  134  to allow the cavity  415  to receive the socket  134  and allow the fastening device  404  to close thereby allowing the fastening device  404  to secure the safety device  400  the extension cord  130 . In addition to the preceding, a shape of the cavity  415  is also selected to accommodate the socket  134  within the fastening device  404  with the fastening device in the closed position. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first wall  418  and the second wall  419  each include a taper that brings the two walls together at the respective distal ends. In one embodiment, the taper of the two walls  418 ,  419  is shaped to conform to the taper found at a transition from the socket  134  to the cord  132  of the extension cord  130 . \\n     The ID 2  of the opening  122  is sized to allow the cord  132  included in the extension cord  130  to extend outside the cavity  415 . According to the illustrated embodiment, the ID 2  of the opening  422  is sized slightly larger than the OD 2  of the cord  132 . A proper sizing of the ID 2  of the opening  422  relative to the OD 2  of the cord  132  also allows the first distal end  423  and the second distal end  424  to meet properly to secure the two ends together with the fastening device  404  in the closed position. \\n     To provide wide adaptability, the dimensions (W 4 , L 4 ) and shape of the cavity  415  can be provided based on the dimensions and shapes of the most widely available extension cords, for example, 20 Amp, 120 VAC extension cord carried at one or more box stores found nationally. The conductor size and insulation ratings of the extension cords are standardized based on the operating voltage and current ratings of the power circuits typically found in home, and at commercial and industrial sites. This standardization allows the ID 2  of the opening  122  to be sized and adapted to receive a cord having an outside diameter most often found among common extension cords. \\n     In operation, the fastening device  404  is placed in the open position by spreading the first wall  418  apart from the second wall  419 . The extension cord  130  is then positioned to align the female socket  134  with male plug  410  and the safety device  400  is plugged into the female socket  134  to bring the face  409  into contact with the face  131 . The first wall  418  and the second wall  419  are then moved together to bring the first distal end  423  into contact with the second distal end  424 . With the first distal end  418  attached to the second distal end  419  the female socket  134  is secured within the cavity  415  and the cord  132  extends through the opening  422 . \\n     One advantage to the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 4A-4C  is that the safety device  400  can provide a universal approach suitable to any of a wide variety of extension cords. Once attached to the distal end of the extension cord  130 , the safety device  400  is easily moved about a job site as a part of the extension cord  130 . Because the safety device  400  becomes a functional part of the extension cord  130  once attached, the device  400  can be employed with any electrically-powered piece of equipment that is being plugged into the extension cord  130 . That is, the safety device  400  does not become tied up with a single piece of equipment. Instead, so long as the safety device remains secured to the female plug  134 , the safety device  400  is automatically employed with each new piece of equipment that is plugged into the extension cord  130 . \\n     In addition, the attachment of the safety device  400  at the distal end of the extension cord  130  also places the device  400  in close proximity to the user. This helps insure that the safety device  400  is in close proximity to the safety glasses  150 . The close proximity assists the continuity of the wireless communication between the safety device  400  and the safety glasses  150 . The preceding is especially advantageous when compared with an alternative safety device that is located at the proximate end of the extension cord  130  and/or at the socket where the cord  130  is plugged-in. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 5 , an electronic system  500  is illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. The electronic system  500  includes a first electronic apparatus  551  configured for inclusion in the safety device  100 ,  400  and a second electronic apparatus  552  configured for inclusion in the safety glasses  150 . For example, the first electronic apparatus can be located in the body  102 ,  402  of safety device with the second electronic apparatus  552  included as a part of the safety glasses  150 . In general, the electronic system  500  provides for: sensing of a status of the safety glasses (for example, whether they are being worn properly); operation of an isolation device to maintain an electrical output in an off state unless the glasses are being worn properly; and wireless communication between the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552 . As described herein, additional or alternate features and functionality of the electronic system  500  can vary depending on the embodiment. \\n     According to the illustrated embodiment, the first electronic apparatus  551  includes a user interface  512 , an isolation device  514 , a power system  553 , a processor  554 , a memory  555  and a communication module  556 . The second electronic apparatus  552  includes a sensor  558 , a power system  560 , a processor  562 , a user interface  564  and a communication module  566 . Each of the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552  include respective power circuits (not illustrated). For example, the components included in the first electronic apparatus  551  can be coupled to the power system  553  by one or more power buses or lines. The power buses are employed to deliver the necessary power to the various illustrated components and to other components included in the device depending on the embodiment. The components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can be coupled to the power system  560  in a similar fashion. \\n     Each of the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552  also include respective communication circuits (not illustrated). For example, the components included in the first electronic apparatus  551  can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines. The communication buses can be used for the communication of instructions/commands and data between the illustrated components and between the illustrated components and other components included in the device depending on the embodiment. The components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines included in the apparatus  552  in a similar fashion. \\n     In some embodiments, the isolation device  514  operates in the manner described above concerning the isolation device  114 . For example, depending on the embodiment, the isolation device  514  can operate to open and close one or more conductors included in the body  102 ,  402 . When open, the isolation device prevents current flow between the female socket  108 ,  408  and the male plug  110 ,  410  included in the safety device  100 ,  400 . The isolation device closes when the safety device  100 ,  400  receives a signal that indicates the safety glasses  150  are being worn properly. The isolation device  514  can be implemented using any of a variety of technologies depending on the embodiment and provided that the isolation device is rated for the operating voltage and current required for a particular application, for example, a 120 VAC, 20 Amp circuit. According to one embodiment, the isolation device  514  includes a mechanical switch including contacts that make and break the conductor in which the device  514  is installed. According to an alternate embodiment, the isolation device  514  includes an electronic switch that operates to block current flow, for example, when the isolation device  514  is in the off state. \\n     The communication module  556  can also be implemented using any of a variety of technologies depending on the embodiment provided that the module  556  supports wireless communication with the second electronic apparatus  552 . For example, the communication module  556  can employ one of either RF communication or optical communication in different embodiments. According to one embodiment, a Bluetooth\u2122 protocol is employed by the communication module  556 . Such a protocol or a similar technology is well suited to the wireless communication employed by the system  500  because the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552  are typically separated by a small distance and the amount of data transmitted between the two devices is typically not large. According to one embodiment, a Bluetooth\u2122 protocol is implemented with an automatic pairing of the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552 . For example, the automatic pairing can be completed independent of any action by the user other than turning on either or both of the first electronic apparatus  551  and the second electronic apparatus  552 . The preceding approach is advantageous in a retail setting where, for example, a system (for example, the system  200 ) including each of the safety device  100 ,  400  and the safety glasses  150  can be packaged and sold together to an end consumer. Once the system is purchased, the user need only remove the system from the packaging and turn on the system to use the safety device. The approach is also advantageous in situations where multiple users are located on the same job site because it helps ensure that the user and their associated safety device  100 ,  400  are in communication with the associated pair of safety glasses. \\n     According to various embodiments, the communication module  556  includes one or more of a USB port or other hardware serial communication in combination with the capability to employ one or more wireless communication protocols such as an optical communication protocol, a Bluetooth\u2122 communication protocol or a Wi-Fi communication protocol.

The power system  553  can include any of a power source, power conversion circuitry and power conditioning circuitry. In some embodiments, the power system  553  includes a battery power source, for example, one or more coin cell batteries, alkaline batteries or lithium batteries. According to another embodiment, the power system  553  is employed to convert power provided from a line conductor included in the body  102 ,  402 . In either approach, power conversion circuitry can be included to convert the power provided from the power source to a nominal voltage and/or current required by the components included in the first electronic apparatus  551 . \\n     Depending on the embodiment, the processor  554  and the memory are included in a microcontroller. According to another embodiment, the processor  554  is included in the microcontroller along with memory  555  including either or both of RAM and ROM. In a further embodiment, the memory  555  also includes memory external to microcontroller. In other embodiments, the processor can be included in a microprocessor. According to one embodiment, the first electronic apparatus  551  includes one or more integrated circuits. \\n     The user interface  512  can vary depending on the embodiment as described above concerning the user interface  112  illustrated in  FIG. 1 . For example, the user interface  512  can include one or more indicating lamps, switches or pushbuttons or audio speakers. In one embodiment, the user interface includes a display, for example, an LCD display that can display the state/status of the various features and functionality included in the safety device  100 ,  500  in which the first electronic apparatus  551  is installed. \\n     The sensor  558  included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can employ different types of technology depending on the embodiment. In various embodiments, a pressure sensitive switch is included in the sensor  558  to sense contact between the users head, face or nose when the safety glasses are being worn by the user. According to one embodiment, a mechanical switch is employed. According to another embodiment, a piezoelectric switch is employed. According other embodiments, the sensor  558  includes a physiological-monitoring sensor. For example, the sensor  558  can employ a capacitive sensor to determine whether the safety glasses are in contact with the skin of the user. A pulse or skin temperature sensor can be used in other embodiments. Further, the sensor  558  can include a single sensor, multiple sensors of the same type or multiple different-types of sensors depending on the embodiment. According to further embodiments, the sensor  558  can include one or more inertial sensors. For example, the sensor  558  can include one or more accelerometers employed to detect an orientation and/or relative motion of the safety glasses  550 . In one embodiment, the sensor  558  includes a multi-axis accelerometer to determine the orientation of the safety glasses relative to the orientation of the user. \\n     The communication module  566  included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can also be implemented using any of a variety of technologies depending on the embodiment provided that the module  566  supports wireless communication with the first electronic apparatus  551 . For example, the communication module  566  can employ one of either RF communication or optical communication in different embodiments. According to one embodiment, a Bluetooth\u2122 protocol is employed by the communication module  566 . As mentioned above concerning the communication module included in the first electronic apparatus  551 , automatic pairing can be employed in some embodiments to improve the user&#39;s experience and better ensure that the safety device  100 ,  400  is effectively employed. \\n     The user interface  564  can vary depending on the embodiment. For example, the user interface  564  can include one or more indicating lamps, switches or pushbuttons or audio speakers. Due to the size constraints of the second electronic apparatus  552 , the scale and functionality of the user interface  564  may be more limited than that found in the user interface  512  included in the first electronic apparatus  551 . According to one embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  does not include the user interface  564 . According to another embodiment, the user interface  564  only includes one or more indicating lamps, for example, to provide the user with information concerning whether the wireless communication module  566  is operational. \\n     In various embodiments, the power system  560  is employed to provide operating power for the second electronic apparatus  552 . For example, operating power can be provided for operating one or more of the components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  such as the processor  554 , and the communication module  556  as two examples. The power system  560  can include any of a power source, power conversion circuitry and power conditioning circuitry. In some embodiments, the power system  560  includes a battery power source, for example, one or more coin cell batteries, alkaline batteries or lithium batteries. According to some embodiments, power conversion circuitry can be included to convert the power provided from the power source to a nominal voltage and/or current required by the components included in the second electronic apparatus  552 . According to one embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  is a passive device (for example, a passive RFID device) that does not include the power source  560 . \\n     Depending on the embodiment, the processor  562  can be a standalone component (for example, a microprocessor) or included in a microcontroller. According to either embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  can include memory, for example, RAM, ROM or a combination of both RAM and ROM. \\n     According to various embodiments, the second electronic apparatus  552  is provided in a form factor that is small enough to allow the apparatus  552  to be integrated into the safety glasses  150  without interfering with their use. For example, users often have a negative view of personal protective equipment (glasses, gloves, respirators, etc.) because they can increase the difficulty in completing a task. Thus, the second electronic apparatus  552  must be small enough to avoid a negative impact on the perceived comfort and utility of the safety glasses  150  in which the second electronic apparatus  552  is employed. The size and functionality of the components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can be selected with the preceding in mind to maintain the small profile and form factor required of the apparatus  552 . Further, although the second electronic apparatus  552  is illustrated as a single element including different components (i.e., the sensor  558 , the processor  562 , etc.), one or more of the identified components or other components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can be located at a first region of the safety glasses  150  while another component or components included in the second electronic apparatus  552  can be located at a second region of the safety glasses  150 . \\n     Safety glasses can sometimes be damaged during normal use such that they have to replaced. According to one embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  is detachable from the safety glasses  150  either in whole or part. For example, the second electronic apparatus  552  can be fastened to a first pair of safety glasses in a manner that allows the second electronic apparatus  552  to be removed and re-fastened to a second pair of safety glasses if the first pair of safety glasses becomes unusable. \\n     According to some embodiments, the system  500  includes an RFID system where, for example, the first electronic device  551  interrogates the second electronic device  552  to determine the status of a particular pair of safety glasses, i.e., whether he glasses are being worn properly. According to one embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  is a battery assisted RFID tag. In one alternate embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  is a semi-active RFID tag. In still another alternate embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  is an active RFID tag. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 6 , a safety kit  670  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. The safety kit  670  includes a product package  672 , a safety device  600 , and safety glasses  650 . According to the illustrated embodiment, a first electronic system  651  is included in the safety device  600  and a second electronic system  652  is included as a part of the safety glasses  650 . In the illustrated embodiment, each of the safety device  600  and the safety glasses  650  are enclosed in the package  672 . \\n     According to some embodiments, the product package  672  is configured for display at a point of sale location, for example, for display on a rack or shelf viewed by shoppers in a retail store. In one embodiment, all or a portion of the product package  672  is transparent. Transparent packaging allows the shoppers to easily view the safety items included in the package to quickly ascertain the nature of the contents included therein. For example, with the safety device  600  and the safety glasses  652  visible to individuals passing by the display, shoppers will readily understand that the combination provides an eye-safety solution in combination with an electrical isolation device. Although  FIG. 6  illustrates the product package  672  in the form of a blister pack other forms of packaging can be used depending on the embodiment. According to one embodiment, the safety device  600  and the safety glasses  652  are packaged in cardboard packaging including a transparent window. According to another embodiment, the safety device  600  and the safety glasses  652  are packaged in non-rigid transparent packaging, for example, a plastic bag. According to still another embodiment, the safety device  600  and the safety glasses  652  are packaged in the product package  672  and are not visible without opening the package  672 . \\n     According to various embodiments, the first electronic apparatus  651  includes components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the first electronic apparatus  551  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . Further, depending on the embodiment, the second electronic apparatus  552  can include components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the second electronic apparatus  552  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . In general, the safety device  600  and safety glasses  650  operate to maintain electrical isolation of equipment plugged into the safety device  600  until the safety glasses  650  are being worn properly by the user. \\n     Depending on the embodiment, the safety device  600  can provide an apparatus that is configured to secure to the distal end of a cord employed with electrically-operated equipment, (for example, the safety device  100 ) or at the distal end an extension cord (for example, the safety device  400 ). Various embodiments can provide a \u201cuniversal\u201d solution where a cavity (for example, one of the cavities  115 ,  415 ) and an opening (for example, one of the openings  122 ,  422 ) are sized and adapted to allow the safety device  650  to be employed with the most common range of physical sizes and electrical ratings of cords employed with utilization equipment and extension cords, respectively. According to these embodiments, the safety device can be easily secured to a first piece of equipment while that piece of equipment is being used and then removed and attached to the power cord of a second piece of equipment when the second piece of equipment is being used. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 7 , a safety system  776  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. The safety system  776  includes a safety device  700 , safety glasses  750  and an extension cord  730  including a power cord  732 , a distal end  734  and a proximate end  735 . The safety device  700  includes a body  702  that houses a user interface  712  and an isolation device  714 . The safety glasses  750  include an electronic apparatus  752 . In general, the safety device  700  and safety glasses  750  operate to maintain electrical isolation between equipment plugged into the distal end of the safety cord  734  and the proximate end  735  of the safety cord until the safety glasses  750  are being worn properly by the user. \\n     In various embodiments, the safety device  700  is included as an integral part of the extension cord  730 , for example, an integral part of an otherwise conventional extension cord. According to some embodiments, the user interface  712  and isolation device  714  are included in an electronic apparatus that includes components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the first electronic apparatus  551  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . Further, depending on the embodiment, the electronic apparatus  752  can include components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the second electronic apparatus  552  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . \\n     Because the safety device  700  is an integral component of the extension cord  730 , the safety device  700  is automatically employed with any piece of electrically-operated equipment that is powered by the extension cord  730 . In addition, it is impractical for a user operating equipment using the extension cord  730  to remove the safety device  700  from the cord  732 . Thus, the safety device  700  goes wherever the extension cord  730  is used. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 8 , a safety system  877  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. The safety system  877  includes a safety device  800 , safety glasses  850  and battery-operated equipment  843  including a battery pack  845 . The battery pack  845  includes terminals  848  that are connected to an electric motor included in the battery-operated equipment  843 . In some embodiments, the battery pack  845  is a removable battery pack. The safety glasses  850  include an electronic apparatus  852 . In general, the safety device  800  and safety glasses  850  operate to maintain electrical isolation between at least one conductor included in the output of the battery pack  845  and a corresponding input connection to the electric motor until the safety glasses  850  are being worn properly by the user. \\n     The battery-operated equipment  843  can include hand-held power tools, for example, a jig saw  843 A, a sander  843 B, a reciprocating saw  843 C and a nail gun  843 D. One of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure provided herein will recognize the preceding list is non-exhaustive. Thus, while the illustrated embodiment shows a mix of conventional cordless equipment, other cordless equipment can be employed with the safety device  800 , for example, staple guns and drills to name two. \\n     In various embodiments, the safety device  800  is included as an integral part of the battery pack  845 . According to some embodiments, the safety device  800  is an electronic apparatus that includes components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the first electronic apparatus  551  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . For example, the safety device  800  can include an isolation device and a user interface. Further, depending on the embodiment, the electronic apparatus  852  can include components, features and functionality as described for the various embodiments of the second electronic apparatus  552  illustrated in  FIG. 5 . \\n     According to one embodiment, the battery pack  845  is removed from the battery-operated equipment for recharging via the terminals  848 . For example, the battery pack  845  can be placed in a charging station in which the terminals  848  are connected to a source of charging power. Typically, safety glasses are not required for the charging operation. In this embodiment, the isolation device included in the safety device  800  can be temporarily placed in a closed-state to permit current flow from the terminals  848  to the battery included in the battery pack  845  during charging. In one embodiment, the safety device  800  includes a mechanically operated switch that the user moves from a first position in which a user must be properly wearing safety glasses to close the isolation device to a second position in which the isolation device is placed in a closed position regardless of whether the associated pair of safety glasses  850  is worn by the user. According to one embodiment, the switch is inaccessible unless the battery pack  845  is removed from the battery-operated equipment  843 . Further, the switch and the housing for the battery pack  845  provided by the battery-operated device can be configured such that it creates a mechanical interference that prevents the battery pack  845  from being reinstalled in the battery-operated equipment  843  unless the switch is located in the first position. According to some embodiments, the safety device  800  automatically changes state to permit current flow for charging when the battery pack is removed from the battery operated equipment  843 . \\n     Embodiments of the safety device  800  can be advantageously employed to retrofit battery operated equipment  843  that is provided with a conventional battery pack as originally shipped from the manufacturer. According to these embodiments, a battery pack  845  including the safety device  800  is configured to directly replace the conventional battery pack. The removable nature of the original power source (i.e., the battery pack) allows the retrofit of the battery operated equipment  843  in a ready manner. According to one embodiment, a retrofit battery pack equipped with the safety device  800  is packaged with one or more items of personal protective equipment for sale of the items together with the retrofit battery pack. These systems can be seamlessly deployed together in the field with the safety device  800  and corresponding electronic apparatus  852  paired for immediate use. Thus, worksite safety can be improved at a significant cost savings because there is no need to replace the battery operated equipment itself. \\n     Referring now to  FIG. 9 , a safety system  978  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment. The safety system  978  includes a safety device  900 , safety glasses  950  and equipment powered by a combustion engine  947 .

Similarly, the second abutment  1427  projects radially inward from the inner wall  1419  for a full 360 degrees around the inner wall. The preceding is advantageous where the fastening device  1404  is free to rotate about the body  1402 . According to another embodiment, a longitudinal channel can be provided in the outer surface  1418  to receive a projection extending radially inward from the inner wall  1419 . According to this embodiment, the fastening device  1404  does not rotate about the body  1402 . As a result, the first abutment  1425  and the second abutment  1427  can be located at one or more discrete locations on the outer surface  1418  and the inner wall  1419 , respectively. \\n     In operation, the fastening device  1404  is free to move forward and back relative to the body  1402  as shown by the arrow A in  FIG. 14A . For example, the fastening device  1404  can be moved in a distal direction parallel to a longitudinal axis of the body  1402  until the second abutment  1427  makes contact with the first abutment  1425 . \\n     Further, in some embodiments the body includes one or more additional abutments extending from the outer surface  1418  located at or near the proximate end  1407  of the body  1402 . According to these embodiments, the additional abutment(s) limit the travel of the fastening device  1404  in a direction of the proximate end  1407  of the body  1402 . That is, the fastening device  1404  is moved in the direction of the proximate end  1407  until the second abutment  1427  makes contact with the additional abutment. The preceding approach can assist in preventing the fastening device  1404  from being uncoupled from the body  1402 . \\n     Referring now to  FIGS. 15A-15C , a clamp  1530  is illustrated in accordance with one embodiment.

According to the illustrated embodiment, the two halves  1532 ,  1534  are secured together by threading multiple fasteners (for example, the mechanical fasteners  1536 A,  1536 B) into corresponding threaded holes ( 1538 A,  1538 B) included in the second half  1534 . The clamp  1530  includes an outer surface  1549  formed with the clamp  1530  fully assembled. \\n     In operation, the clamp  1530  is secured around a female socket located at a distal end of a power cord. When assembled, the clamp  1530  provides a cavity sized and configured to receive the female socket within it. A cross-sectional view of the assembled clamp  1530  is illustrated in  FIG. 15C . In the illustrated embodiment, the clamp includes a first cavity  1554  and a second cavity  1560 . The second cavity  1560  includes a diameter  1561  and a length  1562 . According to this embodiment, a power cord is received in the first cavity  1554  and a female socket located at the distal end of the power cord is received in the second cavity  1560 . \\n     Referring now to  FIGS. 16A and 16B , a safety system  1600  including the safety device  1401  and the clamp  1530  is illustrated. According to this embodiment, the safety system  1600  is employed in combination with the extension cord  1163  and the electrical cord  1166  for an electrically-operated device. The extension cord  1163  includes the power cord  1164  and the female socket  1165 . The electrical cord  1166  includes the power cord  1168  and the male plug  1170 .

No. 15/856,849 entitled \u201cSYSTEM, APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EYE PROTECTION,\u201d filed on Dec. 28, 2017, which is a continuation of, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 to U.S. Pat. No. 9,895,265 entitled \u201cSAFETY APPARATUS AND SYSTEM FOR USE WITH EYE PROTECTION,\u201d filed on Jun. 30, 2017, the disclosure of each of the preceding is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">1. Field of Invention</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">This invention relates generally to apparatus, systems and methods for increasing the safety of personnel operating tools and equipment. More specifically, at least one embodiment, relates to systems, apparatus and methods providing improved safety for operators of electrically powered tools and equipment.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">2. Discussion of Related Art</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">More than 800,000 individuals sustain an eye injury annually in U.S. workplaces. Tens or hundreds of thousands of other individuals sustain an eye injury outside of the workplace annually. Workplace eye injuries alone cost an estimated 300 million dollars in lost productivity, medical treatment and worker&#39;s compensation. Frequently, these injuries result from the use of power equipment without eye protection, for example, operation of electrically operated hand tools.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Traditional approaches to eye-safety have developed over time in an effort to reduce eye injuries. For example, systems have been developed to prevent the operation of certain types of medical equipment unless operating personnel are wearing prescribed safety equipment. These and other approaches also employed in industrial settings generally focus on a fixed piece of equipment. Some of these prior approaches are location-based and rely on the fact that the equipment that requires the use of safety equipment will not be moved from the location.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Another approach employs a key lock to lock a switch to the prongs on a plug located at the end of a power cord for a specific piece of equipment. However, application of the preceding is very limited because of the nature of the connection between the lock and a specific type of plug. In addition, an integrated key lock creates a complex mechanical device. Other approaches are directed to an automatic shutoff based on a lack of motion of a piece of equipment. However, these approaches require a physical connection to a sensor included in the piece of electrically operated equipment or employ a device that is included as an integral part of the power cord of the piece of equipment.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Therefore, there is a need for apparatus and systems that provide an adaptable safety system that is better suited to the dynamics found in most workplaces. These approaches provide apparatus and systems that provide a safety interlock that is not restricted to a specific location or a specific piece of equipment.

For example, in a single phase device, the line conductor included in the male plug <b>110</b> is connected to the line conductor in the female socket <b>108</b>, the neutral conductor included in the male plug <b>110</b> is connected to the neutral conductor in the female socket <b>108</b> and the ground conductor included in the male plug <b>110</b> is connected to the ground conductor included in the female receptacle <b>108</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">In various embodiments, the body <b>102</b> is manufactured from a material having electrical insulating properties sufficient to maintain electrical isolation between the conductors located in the body <b>102</b>. Further, the materials of construction of the body <b>102</b> safely insulate the conductors from a user who takes hold of the body <b>102</b>. In further embodiments, the required electrical insulation rating is determined based on the voltage rating of the device, for example, 120 VAC, 240 VAC, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">The fastening device <b>104</b> allows the safety device <b>100</b> to receive the cord <b>140</b> of the power tool <b>142</b> and securely attach the cord <b>140</b> to the device <b>100</b> with the cord <b>140</b> plugged into the female socket <b>108</b> located in the face <b>106</b>. The male plug <b>110</b> is an integral part of the safety device <b>100</b> and is configured to plug into the distal end of the extension cord <b>130</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, the fastening device <b>104</b> includes a fastener <b>116</b>, a first wall <b>118</b> and a second wall <b>119</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b>, respectively, are hingedly attached to the body <b>102</b> such that they are moved apart to place the fastening device <b>104</b> in an open position. To place the fastening device <b>104</b> in the closed position, the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> are moved together to place the respective distal ends of walls <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> adjacent to one another. According to the illustrated embodiment, the respective distal ends of walls <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> are secured to one another by the fastener <b>116</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, the fastener <b>116</b> includes two screws. As is described in greater detail below, other fastening structure can be used alone or in combination with a mechanical fastener.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">The user interface <b>112</b> can vary depending on the embodiment. According to the illustrated embodiment, the user interface <b>112</b> provides two indicating lamps, for example, a red indicating lamp and a green indicating lamp (e.g., LEDs). In one embodiment, the red indicating lamp provides a status indication concerning the state of the electrical isolation device and the green indicating lamp provides an indication of whether the safety device <b>100</b> is connected to an active source of electricity. According to this embodiment, the green indicating lamp is on when the safety device <b>100</b> is connected to an active (i.e., \u201cenergized\u201d) electrical circuit, for example, with the extension cord <b>130</b> connected and plugged into an energized source of electricity. The red indicating lamp is on with the electrical isolation device is closed as a result of the proper use of the safety glasses associated with the device <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, the red lamp can indicate that the electrical isolation device is in a first state that prevents current flow between the male plug <b>110</b> to the female socket <b>108</b>. The green lamp can indicate that the electronic system has placed the electrical isolation device in a second state to permit current flow between the male plug <b>110</b> to the female socket <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the change of state is a result of feedback from the safety glasses concerning whether the safety glasses are being worn properly.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The user interface can include different elements either alone or in combination with indicating lamps depending on the embodiment. Thus, the user interface <b>112</b> can include one or more switches or pushbuttons, for example, to allow a user to turn the electronic system included in the safety device \u201con\u201d or to activate a wireless communication system included in the safety device <b>100</b>.

For example, the indicating lamp can turn on when the communications systems of the safety device and the safety glasses are \u201cpaired\u201d for communication with one another. According to still another embodiment, the user interface includes a speaker to provide an audio output that can provide feedback to the user regarding the operating status of the safety system including the safety device <b>100</b> and/or the status one or more features included in the device <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, a safety system <b>200</b> including the safety device <b>100</b> with a pair of safety glasses <b>150</b> is illustrated in an embodiment in which the device <b>100</b> and glasses <b>150</b> are configured to wirelessly communicate with one another. According to the illustrated embodiment, the safety glasses <b>150</b> include an electronic apparatus <b>152</b>. As is described in greater detail herein, the electronic apparatus <b>152</b> can include one or more sensors to detect whether the safety glasses are being worn properly. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the user interface <b>112</b> and an electrical isolation device <b>114</b>. Other elements of the electronic system included the body are described below with reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates a first hinge <b>120</b>, a second hinge <b>121</b> and a face <b>109</b> which is included in the body. According to this embodiment, the male plug <b>110</b> extends from the face <b>109</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">According to some embodiments, the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> are hingedly connected to the body <b>102</b> on opposite sides of the body from one another. The first wall <b>118</b> is attached to the body at the first hinge <b>120</b> while the second wall <b>119</b> is attached to the body at the second hinge <b>121</b>. According to other embodiments, only a single hinge can be employed where, for example, only one wall of the fastening device pivots while a second wall remains substantially fixed in place. In this embodiment, a position of the single movable wall is adjusted to move the fastening device between the open position and the closed position. According to still another embodiment, hinges are not employed in any of the walls of the fastening device. According to this embodiment, the shape and materials of construction of the fastening device provide a natural resiliency that allows the fastening device to be moved between the open position and the closed position by deformation of the walls. This resiliency causes the distal ends of the walls of the fastening device to \u201cspring\u201d apart from one another when the fastener <b>116</b> releases the respective distal ends of the walls from engagement with one another. Further, while <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a configuration in which the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> are attached to opposing sides of the body, other relative orientations of the two walls <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> can be employed provided that they allow the power cord <b>140</b> to be secured to the safety device <b>100</b> by the fastening device <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the safety device <b>100</b> is connected to each of the extension cord <b>130</b> and the power cord <b>140</b>. The male plug <b>110</b> is connected to the distal end of the extension cord <b>130</b> such that the face <b>109</b> meets a corresponding face of the extension cord. The power cord <b>140</b> is received in a cavity formed in the fastening device <b>104</b> when the fastening device is placed in the closed position. In particular, the male plug <b>136</b> is received in the cavity and the cord <b>138</b> extends from the cavity via an opening located at the distal end of the fastening device <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">According to various embodiments, the electronic apparatus <b>152</b> detects a status of the safety glasses to determine whether the safety glasses are being worn properly. For example, the electronic apparatus <b>152</b> can include one or more switches, biometric sensors and/or inertial sensors used alone, in combination with one another or in combination with other devices to determine whether the safety glasses are being worn properly.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">In operation, the safety system <b>200</b> ensures that a user is properly wearing the safety glasses <b>150</b> before the isolation device <b>114</b> is placed in a state in which the female socket <b>108</b> is energized such that the equipment connected by the power cord <b>140</b> can be operated. For example, where a proximate end of the extension cord <b>130</b> is plugged into an energized wall outlet and the male plug <b>110</b> is plugged into the socket located at a distal end of the extension cord <b>130</b> electricity is present at the safety device <b>100</b>. If the safety glasses <b>150</b> are not being worn, the safety device <b>100</b> receives a signal from the electronic apparatus <b>152</b> indicating that the glasses <b>150</b> are not being worn. Based on that information, the safety device <b>100</b> is placed in a first state in which the isolation device <b>114</b> maintains the female socket <b>108</b> in a de-energized state, for example, by preventing current flow from the male plug <b>110</b> to the female socket <b>108</b>. When the safety glasses <b>150</b> are being worn, the electronic apparatus <b>152</b> wirelessly communicates the updated status to the safety device <b>100</b>. In response, the safety device <b>100</b> is placed in a second state in which the isolation device operates to allow current flow from the male plug <b>110</b> to the female socket <b>108</b> thereby energizing the female socket <b>108</b>. As a result, the equipment connected to the power cord <b>140</b> can now be operated by the user.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref>, the safety device <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments. According to this embodiment, the fastening device <b>104</b> is located to securely attach to the power cord of a piece of electrically operated equipment. As mentioned above, the electrically operated equipment can include portable equipment that is freely moved about by a user (for example, an electrically-operated hand drill) or a fixed piece of equipment (for example, a drill press). In the illustrated embodiment, the fastening device <b>104</b> includes the first side wall <b>118</b> and the second side wall <b>119</b> in an arrangement in which they are pivotably attached to the body <b>102</b> and operate like a set of jaws to move between the open position and the closed position in which the power cord is secured to the body <b>102</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">Details concerning the female socket <b>108</b> are also illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3A</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the female socket <b>108</b> includes a line-conductor socket <b>108</b>A, a neutral-conductor socket <b>108</b>B and a ground-conductor socket <b>108</b>C. Each of these sockets is connected to a corresponding prong included in the male plug <b>110</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, the male plug <b>110</b> includes a line conductor <b>111</b>A, a neutral conductor <b>111</b>B and a ground conductor <b>111</b>C. In the preceding arrangement, the line-conductor socket <b>108</b>A is connected to the line conductor <b>111</b>A, the neutral-conductor socket <b>108</b>B is connected to the neutral conductor <b>111</b>B and the ground-conductor socket <b>108</b>C is connected to the ground conductor <b>111</b>C. According to a further embodiment, the isolation device (for example, the isolation device <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>) is connected in series within the body between the line-conductor socket <b>108</b>A and the line conductor <b>111</b>A.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref>, a top view of the safety device <b>100</b> and the power cord <b>140</b> are illustrated with the device <b>100</b> and the power cord <b>140</b> located in positions adjacent to one another. The power cord <b>140</b> includes a face <b>141</b> located at a distal end of the plug <b>136</b>. A set of conductors <b>139</b> extends from the face <b>141</b>. The set of conductors <b>139</b> includes a line conductor, a neutral conductor and a ground conductor arranged in a conventional layout that allows the socket <b>108</b> to receive the conductors <b>139</b>. The plug <b>136</b> includes dimensions including a width W<b>1</b> and a length L<b>1</b>. The cord <b>138</b> includes an outside diameter OD<b>1</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>, the fastening device <b>104</b> includes a first distal end <b>123</b> located at a distal end of the first wall <b>118</b>. The fastening device <b>104</b> also includes a second distal end <b>124</b> located at a distal end of the second wall <b>119</b>. A first proximate end <b>125</b> is located at a proximate end of the first wall <b>118</b>. A second proximate end <b>126</b> is located at a proximate end of the second wall <b>119</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the fastening device in the closed position in which the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> are pivoted together such that the first distal end <b>123</b> and the second distal end <b>124</b> are located adjacent to one another. According to some embodiments, the first distal end <b>124</b> and the second distal end <b>125</b> are in contact with one another with the fastening device <b>104</b> in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">Although embodiments illustrated herein show the use of a mechanical fastener (for example, the fastener <b>116</b>), other fastening structure can be provided to secure the first distal end <b>123</b> to the second distal end <b>124</b> according to alternate embodiments. For example, a latch can be integrally formed as a feature of the first distal end <b>123</b> and the second distal end <b>124</b>. According to this embodiment, the latch can securely fasten the respective distal ends <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> to one another when the fastening device <b>104</b> is moved to the closed position. Where the fastening device <b>104</b> is formed of a plastic material, for example, injection molded, one or more elements of the latch can be molded into the first distal end <b>123</b> with corresponding features molded into the second distal end <b>124</b> to provide a snap-fit closure. In other embodiments, the fastening device <b>104</b> can include a fastening element on one of the distal ends <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> that moves into engagement by looping that fastening element over the other distal end.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">According to some embodiments, the fastening device <b>104</b> can include a feature that provides a suitable structure to attach a padlock that prevents the fastening device from being opened when the padlock is secured to the attachment structure. For example the first distal end <b>123</b> can include a first opening designed to receive a shackle of a padlock and the second distal end <b>124</b> can include a second opening designed to receive the shackle. According to one embodiment, the first opening and the second opening can extend in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the safety device <b>100</b>. In operation, the distal ends <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> are moved proximate to one another such that the two openings are aligned. The shackle is then slid through the two openings and the padlocked is closed to lock it. The preceding effectively secures the first wall <b>118</b> to the second wall <b>119</b> and places the fastening device in the closed position. The power cord <b>140</b> can be effectively locked to the safety device <b>100</b> in this embodiment. In other embodiments illustrated herein, conventional hand tools can be employed to secure the fastening device in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">According to the illustrated embodiment, a cavity <b>115</b> is formed in a central region of the fastening device <b>104</b>. The cavity <b>115</b> has a width W<b>2</b> and a length L<b>2</b>. The width W<b>2</b> is an interior dimension measured between the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> with the fastening device <b>104</b> in the closed position. The length L<b>2</b> is an interior dimension measured between the face <b>106</b> and distal ends <b>123</b>, <b>124</b> with the fastening device <b>104</b> in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref>, further details of the fastening device <b>104</b> are illustrated in a rear view provided in the direction in which the power cord <b>140</b> is plugged into the safety device <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the fastening device in the closed position. According to this embodiment, an opening <b>122</b> is formed between the first distal end <b>123</b> and the second distal end <b>124</b> with the fastening device <b>104</b> closed. The opening includes an inside diameter ID<b>1</b> located to capture the cord <b>138</b> in the opening when the fastening device <b>104</b> is closed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">Each of the cavity <b>115</b> and the opening <b>122</b> are sized and configured to allow the fastening device <b>104</b> to receive the power cord <b>140</b> and fasten the power cord <b>140</b> to the safety device <b>100</b> when the power cord is plugged into the female socket <b>108</b>. For example, the width W<b>2</b> of the cavity <b>115</b> is sized relative to the width W<b>1</b> of the plug <b>136</b> to allow the cavity <b>115</b> to receive the plug <b>136</b> while still allowing the fastening device <b>104</b> to close and fasten to the power cord <b>140</b>. Similarly, the length L<b>2</b> of the cavity <b>115</b> is sized relative to the length L<b>1</b> of the plug <b>136</b> to allow the cavity <b>115</b> to receive the plug <b>136</b> and allow the fastening device <b>104</b> to close thereby allowing the fastening device <b>104</b> to secure the safety device <b>100</b> the power cord <b>140</b>. In addition to the preceding, a shape of the cavity <b>115</b> is also selected to accommodate the plug <b>136</b> within the fastening device <b>104</b> with the fastening device in the closed position. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> each include a taper that brings the two walls together at the distal end. In one embodiment, the taper of the two walls <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> is shaped to conform to the taper found at a transition from the plug <b>136</b> to the cord <b>138</b> of the power cord <b>140</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">The ID<b>1</b> of the opening <b>122</b> is sized to allow the cord <b>138</b> included in the power cord <b>140</b> to extend outside the cavity <b>115</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, the ID<b>1</b> of the opening <b>122</b> is sized slightly larger than the OD<b>1</b> of the cord <b>138</b>. A proper sizing of the ID<b>1</b> of the opening <b>122</b> relative to the OD<b>1</b> of the cord <b>138</b> also allows the first distal end <b>123</b> and the second distal end <b>124</b> to meet properly to secure the two ends together with the fastening device <b>104</b> in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">To provide wide adaptability, the dimensions (W<b>2</b>, L<b>2</b>) and shape of the cavity <b>115</b> can be provided based on the dimensions and shapes of the power cords found in certain types of equipment (for example, vacuums) or the dimensions and shapes of power cords found in a particular brand of power tool. Electrically-operated hand tools are generally operated using 120 VAC circuits rated at 15 or 20 Amps. The conductor size and insulation ratings of the power cords are standardized based on the operating voltage and current ratings of the power source and the power requirements of the tool. Consequently, the ID<b>1</b> of the opening <b>122</b> can be sized and adapted to receive a cord having an OD most often employed among common hand tools.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">In operation, the fastening device <b>104</b> is placed in the open position by spreading the first wall <b>118</b> apart from the second wall <b>119</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>. The power cord <b>140</b> is then positioned to align the set of conductors <b>139</b> with the female socket <b>108</b> and the power cord <b>140</b> is plugged into the safety device <b>100</b> to bring the face <b>106</b> into contact with the face <b>141</b>. The first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> are then moved together to bring the first distal end <b>123</b> into contact with the second distal end <b>124</b>. With the first distal end <b>118</b> attached to the second distal end <b>119</b> the plug <b>136</b> is secured within the cavity <b>115</b> and the cord <b>138</b> extends through the opening <b>122</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">While the illustrated embodiment, shows that the top and bottom of the cavity <b>115</b> are open other approaches can be used. For example, the first wall <b>118</b> and the second wall <b>119</b> can each wrap 180 degrees around the cavity <b>115</b>. According to this embodiment, an internal diameter provided by the cavity is sized to receive ad fully enclose the plug <b>136</b> when it is plugged in the female socket <b>108</b> and the fastening device <b>104</b> is in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a safety device <b>400</b>.

The length L<b>4</b> is an interior dimension measured between the face <b>406</b> and distal ends <b>423</b>, <b>424</b> with the fastening device <b>404</b> in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4C</figref>, further details of the fastening device <b>404</b> are illustrated in a rear view provided in the direction in which the safety device <b>100</b> is plugged into the extension cord <b>130</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates the safety device <b>400</b> with the fastening device <b>404</b> in the closed position. According to this embodiment, an opening <b>422</b> is formed between the first distal end <b>423</b> and the second distal end <b>424</b> with the fastening device <b>404</b> closed. The opening <b>422</b> includes an inside diameter ID<b>2</b> located to capture the cord <b>132</b> in the opening when the fastening device <b>404</b> is closed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">Each of the cavity <b>415</b> and the opening <b>422</b> are sized and configured to allow the fastening device <b>404</b> to receive the extension cord <b>130</b> and fasten the extension cord <b>130</b> to the safety device <b>400</b> when the safety device <b>400</b> is plugged into the female socket <b>134</b>. For example, the width W<b>4</b> of the cavity <b>115</b> is sized relative to the width W<b>3</b> of the female socket <b>134</b> to allow the cavity <b>415</b> to receive the socket <b>134</b> while still allowing the fastening device <b>404</b> to close and fasten to the extension cord <b>130</b>. Similarly, the length L<b>4</b> of the cavity <b>415</b> is sized relative to the length L<b>3</b> of the female socket <b>134</b> to allow the cavity <b>415</b> to receive the socket <b>134</b> and allow the fastening device <b>404</b> to close thereby allowing the fastening device <b>404</b> to secure the safety device <b>400</b> the extension cord <b>130</b>. In addition to the preceding, a shape of the cavity <b>415</b> is also selected to accommodate the socket <b>134</b> within the fastening device <b>404</b> with the fastening device in the closed position. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first wall <b>418</b> and the second wall <b>419</b> each include a taper that brings the two walls together at the respective distal ends. In one embodiment, the taper of the two walls <b>418</b>, <b>419</b> is shaped to conform to the taper found at a transition from the socket <b>134</b> to the cord <b>132</b> of the extension cord <b>130</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">The ID<b>2</b> of the opening <b>122</b> is sized to allow the cord <b>132</b> included in the extension cord <b>130</b> to extend outside the cavity <b>415</b>. According to the illustrated embodiment, the ID<b>2</b> of the opening <b>422</b> is sized slightly larger than the OD<b>2</b> of the cord <b>132</b>. A proper sizing of the ID<b>2</b> of the opening <b>422</b> relative to the OD<b>2</b> of the cord <b>132</b> also allows the first distal end <b>423</b> and the second distal end <b>424</b> to meet properly to secure the two ends together with the fastening device <b>404</b> in the closed position.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">To provide wide adaptability, the dimensions (W<b>4</b>, L<b>4</b>) and shape of the cavity <b>415</b> can be provided based on the dimensions and shapes of the most widely available extension cords, for example, 20 Amp, 120 VAC extension cord carried at one or more box stores found nationally. The conductor size and insulation ratings of the extension cords are standardized based on the operating voltage and current ratings of the power circuits typically found in home, and at commercial and industrial sites. This standardization allows the ID<b>2</b> of the opening <b>122</b> to be sized and adapted to receive a cord having an outside diameter most often found among common extension cords.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">In operation, the fastening device <b>404</b> is placed in the open position by spreading the first wall <b>418</b> apart from the second wall <b>419</b>. The extension cord <b>130</b> is then positioned to align the female socket <b>134</b> with male plug <b>410</b> and the safety device <b>400</b> is plugged into the female socket <b>134</b> to bring the face <b>409</b> into contact with the face <b>131</b>. The first wall <b>418</b> and the second wall <b>419</b> are then moved together to bring the first distal end <b>423</b> into contact with the second distal end <b>424</b>. With the first distal end <b>418</b> attached to the second distal end <b>419</b> the female socket <b>134</b> is secured within the cavity <b>415</b> and the cord <b>132</b> extends through the opening <b>422</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">One advantage to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> is that the safety device <b>400</b> can provide a universal approach suitable to any of a wide variety of extension cords. Once attached to the distal end of the extension cord <b>130</b>, the safety device <b>400</b> is easily moved about a job site as a part of the extension cord <b>130</b>. Because the safety device <b>400</b> becomes a functional part of the extension cord <b>130</b> once attached, the device <b>400</b> can be employed with any electrically-powered piece of equipment that is being plugged into the extension cord <b>130</b>. That is, the safety device <b>400</b> does not become tied up with a single piece of equipment. Instead, so long as the safety device remains secured to the female plug <b>134</b>, the safety device <b>400</b> is automatically employed with each new piece of equipment that is plugged into the extension cord <b>130</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In addition, the attachment of the safety device <b>400</b> at the distal end of the extension cord <b>130</b> also places the device <b>400</b> in close proximity to the user. This helps insure that the safety device <b>400</b> is in close proximity to the safety glasses <b>150</b>. The close proximity assists the continuity of the wireless communication between the safety device <b>400</b> and the safety glasses <b>150</b>. The preceding is especially advantageous when compared with an alternative safety device that is located at the proximate end of the extension cord <b>130</b> and/or at the socket where the cord <b>130</b> is plugged-in.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">Referring now to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, an electronic system <b>500</b> is illustrated in accordance with some embodiments. The electronic system <b>500</b> includes a first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> configured for inclusion in the safety device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> and a second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> configured for inclusion in the safety glasses <b>150</b>. For example, the first electronic apparatus can be located in the body <b>102</b>, <b>402</b> of safety device with the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> included as a part of the safety glasses <b>150</b>. In general, the electronic system <b>500</b> provides for: sensing of a status of the safety glasses (for example, whether they are being worn properly); operation of an isolation device to maintain an electrical output in an off state unless the glasses are being worn properly; and wireless communication between the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b>. As described herein, additional or alternate features and functionality of the electronic system <b>500</b> can vary depending on the embodiment.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">According to the illustrated embodiment, the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> includes a user interface <b>512</b>, an isolation device <b>514</b>, a power system <b>553</b>, a processor <b>554</b>, a memory <b>555</b> and a communication module <b>556</b>.

Each of the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> include respective power circuits (not illustrated). For example, the components included in the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> can be coupled to the power system <b>553</b> by one or more power buses or lines. The power buses are employed to deliver the necessary power to the various illustrated components and to other components included in the device depending on the embodiment. The components included in the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> can be coupled to the power system <b>560</b> in a similar fashion.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">Each of the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> also include respective communication circuits (not illustrated). For example, the components included in the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines. The communication buses can be used for the communication of instructions/commands and data between the illustrated components and between the illustrated components and other components included in the device depending on the embodiment. The components included in the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> can be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines included in the apparatus <b>552</b> in a similar fashion.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">In some embodiments, the isolation device <b>514</b> operates in the manner described above concerning the isolation device <b>114</b>. For example, depending on the embodiment, the isolation device <b>514</b> can operate to open and close one or more conductors included in the body <b>102</b>, <b>402</b>. When open, the isolation device prevents current flow between the female socket <b>108</b>, <b>408</b> and the male plug <b>110</b>, <b>410</b> included in the safety device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b>. The isolation device closes when the safety device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> receives a signal that indicates the safety glasses <b>150</b> are being worn properly. The isolation device <b>514</b> can be implemented using any of a variety of technologies depending on the embodiment and provided that the isolation device is rated for the operating voltage and current required for a particular application, for example, a 120 VAC, 20 Amp circuit. According to one embodiment, the isolation device <b>514</b> includes a mechanical switch including contacts that make and break the conductor in which the device <b>514</b> is installed. According to an alternate embodiment, the isolation device <b>514</b> includes an electronic switch that operates to block current flow, for example, when the isolation device <b>514</b> is in the off state.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">The communication module <b>556</b> can also be implemented using any of a variety of technologies depending on the embodiment provided that the module <b>556</b> supports wireless communication with the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b>. For example, the communication module <b>556</b> can employ one of either RF communication or optical communication in different embodiments. According to one embodiment, a Bluetooth\u2122 protocol is employed by the communication module <b>556</b>. Such a protocol or a similar technology is well suited to the wireless communication employed by the system <b>500</b> because the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b> are typically separated by a small distance and the amount of data transmitted between the two devices is typically not large. According to one embodiment, a Bluetooth\u2122 protocol is implemented with an automatic pairing of the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b>. For example, the automatic pairing can be completed independent of any action by the user other than turning on either or both of the first electronic apparatus <b>551</b> and the second electronic apparatus <b>552</b>. The preceding approach is advantageous in a retail setting where, for example, a system (for example, the system <b>200</b>) including each of the safety device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> and the safety glasses <b>150</b> can be packaged and sold together to an end consumer. Once the system is purchased, the user need only remove the system from the packaging and turn on the system to use the safety device. The approach is also advantageous in situations where multiple users are located on the same job site because it helps ensure that the user and their associated safety device <b>100</b>, <b>400</b> are in communication with the associated pair of safety glasses.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">According to various embodiments, the communication module <b>556</b> includes one or more of a USB port or other hardware serial communication in combination with the capability to employ one or more wireless communication protocols such as an optical communication protocol, a Bluetooth\u2122 communication protocol or a Wi-Fi communication protocol.
