            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0001] 1. Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] This invention generally relates to a multi-layer plastic pipe and a method for manufacturing the same, and, in particular, to such a plastic pipe as a duct for use as an automobile component like an intake manifold.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art  \\n       [0004] Since the advent of a method for manufacturing a plastic pipe whose center axis varies two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally in an arbitrary manner by blow molding, many of the pipes or ducts used in automobiles have been and still are being replaced with plastic pipes and ducts. By providing such plastic pipes having a two-dimensional or three-dimensional arbitrary shape, for example, when ducts or pipes are to be disposed in a limited space of an automobile, such as an engine room, without the necessity to assemble a plurality of pipe components having simpler shapes, a plastic pipe of a unitary structure having a complicatedly bent shape, either two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally, can be provided, which contributes to facilitate an mounting operation of ducts or pipes. In addition, with such a plastic pipe of a unitary structure, since there is no connection between pipe components, there is no possibility of occurrence of leaks of a fluid passing through the ducts or pipes. For this reason, many of the conventional ducts or pipes made of rubber or the like for use in an engine room of an automobile have been and are being replaced by plastic pipes.  \\n       [0005] However, for example, even for duct and pipes for use in an engine room of an automobile, the required conditions may vary radically depending on the conditions in which they are used. In particular, since such a duct or pipe as an intake manifold is directly mounted on an engine, it is exposed to a significantly high temperature, and, moreover, since a vibration is directly applied thereto, a high degree of durability is required. For such a reason, the conventional intake manifold of an automobile was normally fabricated from a metal, such as aluminum. However, when a duct or pipe is to be manufactured from a metal, its manufacturing operation is complicated, difficult and expensive, and, moreover, the shape of a duct or pipe to be manufactured tends to be limited.  \\n       [0006] Therefore, a considerable effort and a sizable amount of money have been expended to try to replace such a duct or pipe as an intake manifold with a plastic duct or pipe; however, since it is a kind of duct or pipe which requires a high degree of heat-resistant characteristic as well as an increased durability, there has not yet been proposed any such plastic pipe or duct which can be put to practical use and its manufacturing method.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0007] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a multi-layered plastic pipe having a structure which allows to provide a plastic pipe having a high degree of durability and heat-resistant characteristic and its manufacturing method. It is to be noted that here the terms \u201cpipe\u201d and \u201cduct\u201d are used exchangeably without changing their meanings.  \\n       [0008] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a multi-layered plastic pipe includes a hollow member formed in a desired shape from a first plastic material. At least one spacer member or projection formed from a second plastic material is provided at a predetermined location on an outer surface of the hollow member. In addition, an outer layer of a third plastic material is formed on the outer surface of the hollow member integrally with the spacer member.  \\n       [0009] In a preferred embodiment, the hollow member is manufactured to a desired shape by blow molding, and the spacer member is integrally formed with the hollow member when blow molded. Moreover, preferably, the outer layer includes at least one integrally formed flange portion at an end of the plastic pipe.  \\n       [0010] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe by integrally forming an outer layer of a third plastic material on the outer peripheral surface of a hollow core which has been molded to a desired shape from a first plastic material. In accordance with a preferred method of the present invention, when the hollow core is placed in a mold cavity, at least one spacer member is interposed between-the outer surface of the hollow core and the surface of the mold cavity to thereby define a predetermined gap therebetween. Then, the third plastic material in a molten state is injected into the cavity or the gap between the outer surface of the hollow core and the mold surface and the third plastic material thus injected is hardened, for example, by cooling, thereby forming an outer layer integrally on the outer surface of the hollow core, together with the spacer member. Preferably, the hollow core is fabricated by blow molding, together with the spacer member integrally. In this manner, since the spacer member is present between the hollow core and the cavity surface when the hollow core is placed in position in the mold cavity, a predetermined gap can be maintained between the hollow core and the cavity surface while the molten third plastic material is injected into the cavity. As a result, there can be formed an outer layer having a desired thickness and a desire shape across the entire surface of the hollow core.  \\n       [0011] In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided another method for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe. In accordance with this method, a plurality of mold segments are put together to define a mold cavity with a hollow plastic core placed inside the mold cavity. In this case, the mold segments are not completely put together, but a predetermined clearance is maintained between at least two of the mold segments such that the clearance may allow air to pass therethrough, but it does not allow any molten plastic material to pass therethrough. Under the condition, a plastic material in a molten state is supplied under pressure into the cavity, and, then, the mold segments are put together completely to thereby apply a pressure to the plastic material thus supplied into the cavity, so that an outer layer having a desired shape is integrally formed from a third plastic material on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow core in a unitary structure.  \\n       [0012] Preferably, in order to prevent the hollow core from being undesirably deformed during manufacture, the hollow plastic core may be filled with particles, such as sand, or a pressurized gas may be supplied into the interior of the hollow core at least while an external pressure is applied to the outer surface of the hollow core.  \\n       [0013] It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved plastic pipe and a method for manufacturing the same.  \\n       [0014] Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having an increased durability and an enhanced heat-resistant characteristic and its manufacturing method.  \\n       [0015] A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved plastic pipe which can be used as an intake manifold and its manufacturing method.  \\n       [0016] A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved plastic pipe simple in structure and thus easy to manufacture and low at cost.  \\n       [0017] Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0018]FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration showing a multi-layered plastic pipe constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0019]FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration showing a cross section of the plastic pipe taken along line A-A indicated in FIG. 1;  \\n     [0020]FIG. 3 is a schematic illustrating showing an end view of the plastic pipe of FIG. 1;  \\n     [0021]FIGS. 4 a  through  4   c  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0022]FIGS. 5 and 6 are schematic illustrations showing a modification to the process shown in FIGS. 4 a  through  4   c;    \\n     [0023]FIGS. 7 a  and  7   b  are schematic illustrations showing the principle in positioning a spacer member in practicing the present invention;  \\n     [0024]FIGS. 8 a  through  8   d  are schematic illustrations showing various embodiments of the spacer member;  \\n     [0025]FIGS. 9 a,    9   b,    10   a  and  10   b  are schematic illustrations showing alternative structures of molds which can be advantageously used for practicing the present invention;  \\n     [0026]FIGS. 11 a  through  11   g  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps in manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having both of soft and hard portions in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0027]FIGS. 12 a  through  12   c  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps in manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a bellowed portion in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0028]FIGS. 13 a  through  13   d  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps in manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe including a pair of independent flow passages in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0029]FIGS. 14 a  through  14   c  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps in manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe including a pair of independent flow passages in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention;  \\n     [0030]FIGS. 15 a  through  15   f  are schematic illustrations showing a sequence of steps in manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe including a flange portion reinforced by a metal member in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention; and  \\n     [0031]FIGS. 16 a  and  16   b  are schematic illustrations showing a modification to the process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe including a flange portion reinforced by a metal member.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0032] Referring now to FIGS. 1 through 3, there is schematically shown a multi-layered plastic pipe  1  constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, and this pipe  1  is particularly suited for use as an intake manifold of an automobile, for example. The multi-layered plastic pipe  1  includes a hollow member  11  which has been formed from a first plastic material into a desired shape, and a spacer member or projection  13  formed from a second plastic material to a predetermined height or thickness is provided at a predetermined location (at six places in the illustrated example) on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member  11 . And, an outer layer  12  is formed in a predetermined shape on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member  11  excepting where the spacer members  13  are provided. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer layer  12  is integrally formed with the hollow member  11  and the spacer members  13 , and the outer layer  13  has a thickness substantially equal to the thickness or height of each of the spacer members  13 . For example, the outer layer  12  may be integrally formed with the hollow member  11  and the spacer members  13  by adhesion or melting. The outer layer  12  defines a flange portion  12   a  at each end of the multi-layered plastic pipe  1 , and each flange portion  12   a  is formed with a plurality of mounting holes  12   b.    \\n     [0033] In a preferred embodiment, the hollow member  11  is formed by blow molding and it has a desired shape with its center axis bent two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally. The spacer members  13  may be integrally formed at the same time when the hollow member  11  is formed by blow molding, or, alternatively, after forming the hollow member  11  by blow molding, the spacer members  13 , which have been made separately, may be integrally provided at predetermined locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member  11 , for example, by using an adhesive or melting them together locally. The spacer members  13  may be made from a plastic material which is the same as or different from that of the hollow member  11 . Thus, the spacer members  13  may provide a locally different characteristic at a location where the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  is locally brought into contact with another member or where another member is to be mounted thereon.  \\n     [0034] The outer layer  12  is integrally formed with the hollow member  11 , but the outer layer  12  may be formed from a plastic material different from the plastic material of the hollow member  11 . As a result, the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  can be given a desired characteristic depending on the condition in which it is used. For example, since the hollow member  11  defines a flow passage for guiding the flow of a fluid, it can be formed from a plastic material having a desired characteristic required in connection with the flow of such fluid. For example, when the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  is to be used as an intake manifold of an engine, use is preferably made of a plastic material having an excellent anti-gasoline characteristic and anti-blow-by gas characteristic; whereas, when the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  is to be used as a radiator hose of an automobile, use is preferably made of a plastic material having an excellent anti-LLC characteristic.  \\n     [0035] The outer layer  12  has a specific object to provide a mechanical strength and/or anti-heat resistant characteristic to the multi-layered plastic pipe  1 . Thus, although the outer layer  12  can be fabricated basically from the same plastic material as that of the hollow member  11 , it is preferable to use such a plastic material which also includes reinforcing materials, such as fibers or fillers. Such reinforcing materials typically include glass fibers, carbon fibers, talc and mica. Different plastic materials may be used for the hollow member  11 , spacer members  13  and outer layer  12  as long as they are soluble to each other. In the case where such a solubility does not exist by themselves, use may be made of an adhesive layer between the two plastic materials having no solubility therebetween. All of the hollow member  11 , spacer members  13  and outer layer  12  may be made from the same plastic material, if desired. The preferred plastic materials to be used for the hollow member  11  and spacer members  13  include nylon 6, nylon 6-6, nylon 6 or 6-6 (containing 20% of glass fibers), nylon 11 or 12, nylon 4-6 or 6-10 or 6-12, nylon family alloys, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PBT (polybutylene terephthalate), PES (polyether sulfone), PEEK (polyetheretherketone), polyimide and polyamideimide. On the other hand, the preferred plastic materials for forming the outer layer  12  include a mixture of each of the plastic materials listed above for forming the hollow member  11  with a desired percentage, such as 30%, of reinforcing materials, such as glass fibers.  \\n     [0036] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, since the outer layer  12  is formed from a plastic material having an excellent mechanical strength, a flange portion  12   a  can be formed as a portion thereof. The flange portion  12   a  is formed with a plurality of mounting holes  12   b,  so that the flange portion  12   a  can be directly mounted, for example, on a port of an engine or a radiator of an automobile using bolts and nuts. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the spacer members  13  are disposed on opposite sides of the hollow member  11 ; however, such a spacer member  13  may be provided at least one location of the outer peripheral surface of the outer member  11 , so that the present invention should not be limited to such a specific arrangement of spacer members  13  as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. As will be described in detail later, the location and number of such spacer members  13  may be determined in accordance with the conditions in which the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  is used and with its manufacturing method used.  \\n     [0037] Next, referring to FIGS. 4 a  through  4   c , a process for manufacturing the multi-layered plastic pipe  1  according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below.  \\n     [0038] As shown in FIG. 4 a , in accordance with this embodiment, use is made of a pair of first mold half  15  and a second mold half  16 , which together define a complete mold when placed in contact together, and these first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are provided to be movable closer to each other or separated away from each other. In the illustrated embodiment, the first mold half  15  is provided fixed in position with its mating surface facing upwards, whereas, the second mold half  16  is provided to be movable vertically so that it can move closer toward or separated away from the associated, stationary first mold half  15 . The mating surface of the first mold half  15  is formed with a first mold groove  15   a  which has a predetermined shape and defines a first half of a mold cavity. A seat section  15   b  is formed at each end of the first mold groove  15   a , and these seat sections  15   b  serve to hole a hollow plastic core  11  in position when it is placed in the first mold half  15   a . The first mold half  15  is also provided with a predetermined number of supply passages  17  which are in communication with a supply source  18  for supplying a plastic material. Thus, the third plastic material in a molten state is supplied from the supply source  18  into the cavity defined by the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  when brought into a semi-mating condition through these supply passages  17 .  \\n     [0039] The second mold half  16  also has a mating surface which is brought into contact with the mating surface of the first mold half  15 , and the mating surface of the second mold half  16  is also formed with a second mold groove  16   a  having a desired shape. As shown, a sliding core  19  is provided at each end of the second mold groove  16   a  and it is provided to be slidingly movable in a guide hole formed in the second mold half  16 . A spring is provided in the guide hole so that the sliding core is normally pressed outward to be located at its advanced location. The sliding core  19  has its front surface shaped to be commensurate with and thus to partly receive therein the hollow plastic core  11  and the front surface of the sliding core  19  may be brought into contact with the mating surface of the first mold half  15 .  \\n     [0040] Now, a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe using a pair of first and second mold halves  15  and  16  as described above will be described. In the first place, the hollow plastic core  11  is formed into a desired shape from a first plastic material, for example, by a blow molding technique. The tip end portion at each end of the hollow plastic core  11  will be eventually removed; however, using these tip end portions, the hollow plastic core  11  is located in position in the first mold groove  15   a  by having its tip end portions placed on the seat sections  15   b  of the first mold half  15  as shown in FIG. 4 a . As shown, the hollow plastic core  11  is provided with a plurality of spacer members  13  at selected locations on its outer peripheral surface. Preferably, these spacer members  13  are formed at the same time when the hollow plastic core  11  is fabricated. In the present embodiment, since it is so structured that a third plastic material in a molten state is supplied into the cavity through supply passages  17  provided in the first mold half  15 , the spacer members  13  are provided only at the upper half of the outer peripheral surface of the horizontally extending hollow plastic core  11 . However, if desired, these spacer members  13  may also be provided at other locations of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11  additionally. It is to be noted, however, that these spacer members  13  should be provided at such locations of the hollow plastic core  11  which can counteract the force applied to the hollow plastic core  11  when the plastic material in a molten state is supplied into the cavity. As a result, in the-present embodiment, these spacer members  13  should be provided at least at an upper half of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11  which extends horizontally.  \\n     [0041] Then, as shown in FIG. 4 b , the second mold half  16  is lowered, during which, the sliding cores  19  are first brought into contact with the respective end portions of the hollow plastic core  11  and with the mating surface of the first mold half  15 . At this time, the hollow plastic core  11  is set in position in the cavity defined between the first and second mold halves  15  and  16 . When the second mold half  16  is further lowered, the sliding cores  19  are retracted into the respective guide holes of the second mold half  16  against the force of the springs  20  since the sliding cores  19  are in contact with the mating surface of the first mold half  15 . When a clearance G between the two mating surfaces of the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  has reached a predetermined value (semi-mating condition), the second mold half  16  stops its descending motion. The value of clearance G in this case may be set at any desired value depending on the circumstances; however, it is typically set in a range between 2 and 5 mm. Under the condition, the third plastic material in a molten state is supplied from the supply source  18  into the cavity through the supply passages  17 . In this case, in the present embodiment, since the spacer members  13  are provided on the hollow plastic core  11  on its outer peripheral surface at such locations opposite to the direction of supply of the third plastic material into the cavity, the hollow plastic core  11  is maintained in position with its spacer members  13  in contact with the surface of the second mold groove  16   a , so that the third plastic material thus supplied is prevented from being biased in distribution inside the cavity.  \\n     [0042] Then, after supplying the third plastic material sufficiently into the cavity, the supply of the third plastic material is terminated, and, as shown in FIG. 4 c , the second mold half  16  is again caused to descend until the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into a complete mating condition in which the mating surface of the first mold half  15  in contact with the mating surface of the second mold half  16 . As a result, the third plastic material supplied into the cavity or the gap between the hollow plastic core  11  and the surface of each of the first and second mold grooves  15   a  and  16   a  is uniformly distributed across the entire cavity, thereby forming the outer layer  12  having a desired shape from the third plastic material and integral with the hollow plastic core  11 . During this compression step, the third plastic material supplied into the cavity will be sufficiently supplied to a large volume section, such as a flange section. In addition, due to the provision of spacer members  13  at selected locations on the hollow plastic core  11 , the hollow plastic core  11  is prevented from deforming and the outer layer  12  having a desired shape and thickness can be integrally fabricated around the hollow plastic core  11 , together with the spacer members  13 .  \\n     [0043] In the case where the strength of the hollow plastic core  11  itself is not sufficient and thus there is a possibility that the hollow plastic core  11  may be deformed during the above-described compression step, the internal space of the hollow plastic core  11  may be filled with particles, such as sand. Alternatively, a pressurized gas may be supplied into the internal space of the hollow plastic core  11  so as to balance the external force applied to the hollow plastic core  11  during the compression step to thereby prevent the hollow plastic core  11  from being deformed. In addition, if there is a possibility that the hollow plastic core  11  may come into contact with the surface of the first mold groove  15   a  during the above-described compression step, the spacer members  13  may also be provided at the lower half of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11 .  \\n     [0044]FIG. 5 illustrates a modification to the process for forming a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flange as shown in FIGS. 4 a  through  4   c . That is, as shown in FIG. 5, a cylinder device  21  is mounted on the first mold half  15 , and a rod  21   a  of the cylinder device  21  passes through a hole provided in the first mold half  15  so that the rod  21   a  may move into the cavity or retract from the cavity. In particular, the rod  21   a  may move into the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove  15   a . Thus, when the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into a complete mating relationship to compress the third plastic material inside the cavity to thereby cause the third plastic material to be supplied to every section of the cavity uniformly, there is still a chance that the third plastic material fails to be properly supplied to the space of a flange forming portion of the cavity or properly compressed. Under the circumstances, during the compression step shown in FIG. 4 a , by causing the rod  21   a  to move into the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove  15   a , an additional compression force may be applied locally to that portion  12 \u2032 of the third plastic material present in the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove  15   a . In this case, a bore or hole is formed in the cylinder portion of the resulting product due to the rod  21   a,  and such a bore or hole may be later defined as a through-hole to be used as a mounting hole  12   b  of the flange portion  12   a.    \\n     [0045] Next, referring to FIGS. 7 a  and  7   b , the principle of determining the location where the spacer member  13  is to be disposed on the hollow plastic core  11  based on the present invention will be described. In the case of FIG. 7 a , the hollow plastic core  11  is set in position by a pair of sliding cores  19  and a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity from a supply port  17  from below. In this case, since the central portion of the hollow plastic core  11  tends to be lifted upward due to the incoming molten plastic material under pressure, a spacer member  13  must be provided on the hollow plastic core  11  somewhere at an upper half of the outer peripheral surface thereof. In FIG. 7 a , although a single spacer member  13  is shown to be provided at a location diametrically opposite to the supply port  17 , it is not always necessary to provide such a single spacer member  13  at a location opposite to the supply port  17  as shown, a desired number of such spacer members  13  may be provided on the hollow plastic core  11  so as to prevent the hollow plastic core  11  from coming into contact with the surface of the cavity.  \\n     [0046] In FIG. 7 b , a hollow plastic core  11  is set in position by means of a pair of sliding cores  19  and a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity from a supply port  17  from above. In this case, since the hollow plastic core  11  tends to be pushed downward at its central portion when the molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity under pressure from the supply port  17 , a single spacer member  13  is provided on the hollow plastic core  11  at its bottom diametrically opposite to the supply port  17  so as to prevent the hollow plastic core  11  from coming into contact with the surface of the cavity. Thus, fundamentally, it is only necessary to provide one or more spacer members  13  on that portion of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11  opposite to that side where a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure. However, it should also be noted that any desired number of such spacer members  13 , same or different in shape and size, may only need to be provided on any portion of the hollow plastic core  11  so as to form the outer layer  12  of desired thickness depending on the shape of the hollow plastic core  11  and the method of supplying a molten plastic material into the cavity.  \\n     [0047] For example, as shown in FIG. 8 a , a plurality of spacer members  13  may be provided circumferentially around the hollow plastic core  11 . In particular, in the case where the hollow plastic core  11  has a complicated shape and a molten plastic material is to be supplied into the cavity through a plurality of supply ports, it is preferable to provide a plurality of such spacer members  13  in the circumferential direction of the hollow plastic core  11 . Even when a plurality of spacer members  13  are to be provided in the circumferential direction of the hollow plastic core  11 , they do not need to be provided on the same circumference at all times, and, instead, such spacer members  13  may also be provided circumferentially as shifted in the longitudinal direction of the hollow plastic core  11  one from another. FIG. 8 b  illustrates the case in which a plurality of spacer members  13  are defined by locally bending portions of the hollow plastic core  11  in the form of radially projecting ridges. Such a profiled hollow plastic core  11  may be easily formed by using a mold whose cavity surface is provided with a plurality of grooves. FIG. 8 c  illustrates a hollow plastic core  11  having a plurality of spacer members  13  partially buried therein, which can be manufactured by arranging a plurality of spacer members  13  in the cavity surface as inserts when blow molding the hollow plastic core  11 . FIG. 8 d  illustrates the case in which, after forming a hollow plastic core  11  by blow molding, a plurality of spacer members  13  which have been fabricated separately are fixedly attached to the hollow plastic core  11  by using an adhesive agent or by melting them together.  \\n     [0048] Next, with reference to FIGS. 9 a,    9   b,    10   a  and  10   b,  the structure of a mold suitable for use in a process of the present invention will be described in detail below. As shown in FIG. 9 a,  the first mold half  15  has a first mold groove  15   a , and on the other hand the second mold half  16  has a second mold groove  16   a . When the first and second mole halves  15  and  16  are brought closer together with a gap or clearance G defined between the respective mating surfaces, a semi-mating condition is defined and a cavity is defined between the first and second mold grooves  15   a  and  15   b . A pair of projections  16   b  is formed on the opposite sides of the second mold groove  16   a , and these projections  16   b  have a height larger than the clearance G. On the other hand, the opposite sides in the first mold groove  15   a  are so structured to be able to receive these projections  16   b , respectively. Thus, in the condition shown in FIG. 9 a,  the tip ends of these projections  16   b  are partially fitted into the respective receiving sections of the first mold groove  15   a  so that the cavity is set in its partially closed state or semi-mating condition. Under this semi-mating condition, air may pass through a clearance between the projection  16   b  and its associated receiving section of the first mold groove  15   a , but no molten plastic material is allowed to pass therethrough.  \\n     [0049] Accordingly, when a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity under pressure under this semi-mating condition, the air inside the cavity is allowed to be discharged out into the atmosphere through the clearance between the projection  16   b  and the associated receiving section of the first mold groove  15   a , whereas the molten plastic material thus supplied into the cavity is substantially prevented from flowing out of the cavity through such clearance. FIG. 9 b  illustrates the condition in which, after supplying a molten plastic material into the cavity, the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into a complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition, and, thus, FIG. 9 b  corresponds to FIG. 4 c;    \\n     [0050]FIG. 10 a  illustrates the structure of another mold for use in another embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 10 a,  the first mold half  15  has a first mold groove  15   a  which is formed with a cut-away section  15   c  at each side thereof, and the second mold half  16  has a second mold groove  16   a  which is formed with a pair of projections  16   c  on the opposite sides thereof. In this case, as different from the embodiment shown in FIG. 9 b,  these projections  16   c  have their sharp tip ends cut away to provide blunt ends. Accordingly, the projections  16   c  of the present embodiment are improved in rigidity, and the shape of these projections  16   c  are least affected or modified by repeated use. As a result, even if a large number of multi-layered plastic pipes are to be manufactured, an intended and same characteristic may be maintained. Moreover, in the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 10 b,  even if the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are set in the complete mating condition, since the projections  16   c  do not occupy the entire space defined by the cut-away sections  15   c,  the resulting multi-layered plastic pipe will have a rib  12   c  formed extending longitudinally as a part of the outer layer  12 . Such a rib  12   c  is preferred in some cases since it would provide an increased strength and rigidity to the outer layer  12 .  \\n     [0051] Next, various modifications and alternate embodiments of the present invention will now be described-below. FIGS. 11 a  through  11   f  illustrate a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flexible or relatively soft fitting section at one end. As shown in FIG. 11 a,  in the first place, a hollow plastic core  11  is fabricated by a blow molding technique. This hollow plastic core  11  includes a hard section  11 H comprised of a relatively hard plastic material and a soft section  11 S comprised of a relatively soft plastic material. As the relatively hard plastic material, use may, for example, be made of nylon 6, whereas, as the relatively soft plastic material, use may, for example, be made of nylon 11. In the case of blow molding a hollow plastic core  11  having a unitary structure from the two plastic materials different in hardness, the plastic material supplied to a nozzle to form a parison is switched from one material to another to thereby form a composite parison having two different plastic materials along different portions of its longitudinal axis and then the resulting composite parison may be subjected to blow molding to define a desired shape.  \\n     [0052] As best shown in FIG. 11 a,  the hollow plastic pipe  11  thus formed has unnecessary portions  11 H\u2032 and  11 S\u2032 at respective ends, and these unnecessary end portions  11 H\u2032 and  11 S\u2032 will be later removed. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 11 a , the soft section  11 S is enlarged in diameter. On the other hand, in an embodiment shown in FIG. 11 b,  both of the hard and soft sections  11 H and  11 S have the same diameter.  \\n     [0053] As shown in FIG. 11 c,  the hollow plastic core  11  thus formed is then set in position in a cavity defined between first and second mold halves  15  and  16 . Then, as shown in FIG. 11 d,  a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through supply passages  17  provided in the first mold half  15 . The molten plastic material supplied in this case is normally a relatively hard plastic material, such as a mixture of nylon 6 and glass fibers (30%). Then, the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition and apply a compression force to the plastic material, so that an outer layer  12  is integrally formed on the outer surface of the hollow plastic core  11 . In this case, preferably, a pressurized gas is injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  or alternatively particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  in advance. In addition, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11  as described before.  \\n     [0054] Then, upon hardening of the molten plastic material, the first and second mold halves are separated from each other and the resulting product molded under pressure is removed from the mold. The resulting product is shown in FIG. 11 e.  Then the undesired portions  11 H\u2032 and  11 S\u2032 are removed-from the product so that a desired multi-layered plastic pipe can be obtained as shown in FIG. 11 f.  FIG. 11 g  illustrates an embodiment where both of the hard and soft sections  11 H and  11 S have the same diameter. The resulting multi-layered plastic pipe has a flange portion  12   a  formed from a relatively hard plastic material at one end and a fitting portion  11 S formed from a relatively soft plastic material at the opposite end. The fitting portion  11 S is relatively soft and thus it may be fitted into or onto another pipe.  \\n     [0055] Now, referring to FIGS. 12 a  through  12   c,  a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a bellowed section in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the first place, as shown in FIG. 12 a , a hollow plastic core  11  is fabricated by a blow molding technique. In this case, the hollow plastic core  11  includes a hard section  11 H comprised of a relatively hard plastic material, such as nylon 6-6, and a bellows section  11 S comprised of a relatively soft plastic material, such as nylon 12. In addition, it also include an undesired portion  11 H\u2032, which will be removed later, at each end thereof. Then, the hollow plastic core  11  shown in FIG.  12   a  is set in position in a cavity defined between the first and second mold halves  15  and  16 , and a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through supply passages  17 . For such a molten plastic material, use may be made, for example, of a mixture of nylon 6-6 and glass fibers (for example, 30%). In this case, the molten plastic material is supplied onto the outer peripheral surface of the hard section  11 H excepting the bellows section  11 S. Then, mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition and the molten plastic material thus supplied is hardened to form an outer layer  12  having a desired shape. In the present embodiment, the outer layer  12  will have a flange portion  12   a  at each end thereof. Preferably, during this compression step, a pressurized gas may be injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  or alternatively particles such as sand particles may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  in advance to prevent deformation from occurring on the hollow plastic core  11  due to an external force applied thereto. In addition, as described before, one or more of spacer members may be provided at selected locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hard section  11 H of the hollow plastic core  11 .  \\n     [0056] Upon completion of molding, the mold halves  15  and  16  are separated to remove the resulting plastic product and its undesired end portions  11 H\u2032 are cut away. The resulting multi-layered plastic pipe is illustrated in FIG. 12 c.    \\n     [0057] Referring now to FIGS. 13 a  through  13   d , a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages will be-described in detail below. FIG. 13 a  illustrates a hollow plastic core  11  fabricated into a desired shape by blow molding. This hollow plastic core  11 , as shown in transverse cross section in FIG. 13 b,  is formed with a pair of upper and lower grooves  11   a  whose bottoms are in contact to thereby define a pair of independent flow passages  11   b.  Such a hollow plastic core  11  is set in position in a cavity defined between a pair of first and second mold halves in a manner described with respect to the before-mentioned embodiments, and then a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity, followed by the steps of bringing the two mold halves in complete contact to carry out forming under pressure. Upon completion of forming, the two mold halves are separated away from each other to remove the resulting product therefrom. And then the undesired end portions are cut away. As a result, there can be obtained a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages as shown in FIG. 13 c.  This multi-layered plastic pipe is formed with a flange portion  12   a  at each end thereof, and its cross sectional structure is illustrated in FIG. 13 d.    \\n     [0058] With reference to FIGS. 14 a  through  14   c , a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of flow passages in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention will now be described. As shown in FIG. 14 a , in the first place, a plurality (two in the illustrated embodiment) of hollow plastic cores  11 - 1  and  11 - 2 , each having its own desired shape, are molded by blow molding. Then, as shown in FIG. 14 b , these two hollow plastic cores  11 - 1  and  11 - 2  are set in position in a cavity defined between a pair of first and second mold halves  15  and  16 . Then, a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity and the two mold halves are brought into complete contact to thereby have the molten plastic material formed into a desired shape under compression. Upon completion of forming, the mold halves are separated away from each other to remove the resulting product and then the undesired end portions are cut away to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages. The cross sectional structure of the resulting multi-layered plastic pipe is illustrated in FIG. 14 c.    \\n     [0059] Now, with reference to FIGS. 15 a  through  15   f,  a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flange portion covered with a metal member in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the first place, as shown in FIG.  15   a , a hollow plastic core  11  is molded by a blow molding technique using a cap-shaped metal member  31  as an insert component. FIG. 15 b  illustrates the condition in which the cup-shaped metal member  31  is integrally formed with the hollow plastic core  11  by blow molding. Then, as shown in FIG. 15 c,  this hollow plastic core  11  is set in position in a mold cavity. In this case, use may be made of a pair of first and second mold halves  15  and  16  as described before, in which case, however, the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are formed with enlarged portions  16   c  of the mold grooves for receiving therein a part of the metal member  31 , respectively. Therefore, in this case, the metal member  31  serves as a stopper for the first and second mold halves  15  and  16 , and the hollow plastic core  11  may be set in position in the cavity when the metal member  31  is properly inserted into the enlarged portions  16   c  of the mold grooves.  \\n     [0060] Then, as shown in FIG. 15 d,  a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through at least one supply passage  17  (not shown) provided in either of or both of the first and second mold halves  15  and  16 . Then, the two mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into complete mating condition to carry out compression forming so that an outer layer  12  having a desired shape is integrally formed from the molten plastic material. In this case, however, it is preferable to supply a pressurized gas into the interior of the hollow plastic core  11 , or, alternatively, particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  in advance so as to prevent the hollow plastic core  11  from being deformed during compression forming. Furthermore, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided at desired locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11 . Upon completion of forming, the mold halves are separated away from each other and the resulting product is removed from the mold. The resulting structure is shown in cross section in FIG. 15 e.    \\n     [0061] Then, the undesired portion  11 \u2032 of the hollow plastic core  11  shown in FIG. 15 e  is cut away, and, as shown in FIG. 15 f,  one or more of mounting holes  12   b  are formed passing through the flange portion  12   a  and the cup-shaped metal member  31 . In a multi-layered plastic pipe thus manufactured, since the flange portion  12   a  is covered with and thus reinforced by the metal member  31 , when the flange portion  12   a  is mounted, for example, on an object, such as an internal combustion engine, by bolts and nuts, the flange portion  12   a  is prevented from being deformed due to bolt tightening, thereby allowing to provide a secure mounting structure.  \\n     [0062]FIGS. 16 a  and  16   b  illustrate another process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe whose flange portion is reinforced by a metal member in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 15 a  and  15   b , in the first place, a hollow plastic core  11  having a metal member  31  is formed by blow molding, and the resulting hollow plastic core  11  is set in position in a mold groove of the first mold half  15 . In this case, the first mold half  15  is formed with a mold groove  15   a  having a predetermined shape, with an enlarged portion  15   c  for partly receiving therein the metal member  32  and with a seat  15   b  for holding thereon an end portion of the hollow plastic core  11 . On the other hand, the second mold half  16  is formed with a second mold groove  16   a  having a predetermined shape and provided with a sliding core  19 , which may move between its advanced position and retracted position and is normally biased toward its advanced position by means of a spring  20 . The sliding core  19  is formed with a cut-away portion  19   a  for receiving therein a part of the metal member  32 .  \\n     [0063] With the above-described structure, when the second mold half  16  is lowered, the metal member  32  is placed into the cut-away portion  19   a  of the sliding core  19 , and the second mold half  16  is further moved downward until the distance between the opposing mating surfaces of the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  becomes a predetermined gap G, wherein a semi-mating condition is set. This condition is illustrated in FIG. 16 b . Under the condition, a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity through supply passages  17  (not shown) provided in either one or both of the first and second mold halves  15  and  16 . Thereafter, the first and second mold halves  15  and  16  are brought into a complete mating condition by reducing the gap G zero to thereby carry out compression forming so that the molten plastic-material is formed into a desired shape around the hollow plastic core  11 . Upon hardening of the molten plastic material, the mold halves  15  and  16  are separated away from each other and the resulting product is removed. Then, similarly as described before, an undesired portion is removed from the resulting product to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe.  \\n     [0064] Also in the present embodiment, as described in each of the above-described embodiments, prior to the step of compression forming, a pressurized gas may be injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core  11 , or, alternatively, particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core  11  so as to prevent the hollow plastic core  11  from being deformed when an external force is applied to the peripheral surface thereof. In addition, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided at one or more selected portions on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core  11 .  \\n     [0065] As described above, in accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a multi-layered plastic pipe excellent in heat-resistant characteristic and durability. In particular, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having a uniform characteristic along the entire length of the plastic pipe by using a desired number of spacer members. Thus, a multi-layered plastic pipe of the present invention can have a characteristic extremely close to design conditions and thus high in reliability. Moreover, the present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe high in reproducibility. Thus, there is provided a process capable for manufacturing various automobile components, such as intake manifolds and radiator hoses, which are exposed to high temperature and vigorous vibrations, from plastic materials. In particular, when applied as ducts to be used in automobiles, the components can be reduced in weight significantly, and, for example, a reduction in weight as much as 50% can be attained when the present invention is used as compared with the case of a prior art intake manifolds made of die-casted aluminum.  \\n     [0066] While the above provides a full and complete disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, various modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents may be employed without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the above description and illustration should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Field of the Invention </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0002\" num=\"0002\">[0002] This invention generally relates to a multi-layer plastic pipe and a method for manufacturing the same, and, in particular, to such a plastic pipe as a duct for use as an automobile component like an intake manifold. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0003\" num=\"0003\">[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] Since the advent of a method for manufacturing a plastic pipe whose center axis varies two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally in an arbitrary manner by blow molding, many of the pipes or ducts used in automobiles have been and still are being replaced with plastic pipes and ducts. By providing such plastic pipes having a two-dimensional or three-dimensional arbitrary shape, for example, when ducts or pipes are to be disposed in a limited space of an automobile, such as an engine room, without the necessity to assemble a plurality of pipe components having simpler shapes, a plastic pipe of a unitary structure having a complicatedly bent shape, either two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally, can be provided, which contributes to facilitate an mounting operation of ducts or pipes. In addition, with such a plastic pipe of a unitary structure, since there is no connection between pipe components, there is no possibility of occurrence of leaks of a fluid passing through the ducts or pipes. For this reason, many of the conventional ducts or pipes made of rubber or the like for use in an engine room of an automobile have been and are being replaced by plastic pipes. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] However, for example, even for duct and pipes for use in an engine room of an automobile, the required conditions may vary radically depending on the conditions in which they are used. In particular, since such a duct or pipe as an intake manifold is directly mounted on an engine, it is exposed to a significantly high temperature, and, moreover, since a vibration is directly applied thereto, a high degree of durability is required. For such a reason, the conventional intake manifold of an automobile was normally fabricated from a metal, such as aluminum. However, when a duct or pipe is to be manufactured from a metal, its manufacturing operation is complicated, difficult and expensive, and, moreover, the shape of a duct or pipe to be manufactured tends to be limited. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] Therefore, a considerable effort and a sizable amount of money have been expended to try to replace such a duct or pipe as an intake manifold with a plastic duct or pipe; however, since it is a kind of duct or pipe which requires a high degree of heat-resistant characteristic as well as an increased durability, there has not yet been proposed any such plastic pipe or duct which can be put to practical use and its manufacturing method. </p>\\n      <heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a multi-layered plastic pipe having a structure which allows to provide a plastic pipe having a high degree of durability and heat-resistant characteristic and its manufacturing method. It is to be noted that here the terms \u201cpipe\u201d and \u201cduct\u201d are used exchangeably without changing their meanings. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a multi-layered plastic pipe includes a hollow member formed in a desired shape from a first plastic material. At least one spacer member or projection formed from a second plastic material is provided at a predetermined location on an outer surface of the hollow member. In addition, an outer layer of a third plastic material is formed on the outer surface of the hollow member integrally with the spacer member. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] In a preferred embodiment, the hollow member is manufactured to a desired shape by blow molding, and the spacer member is integrally formed with the hollow member when blow molded. Moreover, preferably, the outer layer includes at least one integrally formed flange portion at an end of the plastic pipe. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe by integrally forming an outer layer of a third plastic material on the outer peripheral surface of a hollow core which has been molded to a desired shape from a first plastic material. In accordance with a preferred method of the present invention, when the hollow core is placed in a mold cavity, at least one spacer member is interposed between-the outer surface of the hollow core and the surface of the mold cavity to thereby define a predetermined gap therebetween. Then, the third plastic material in a molten state is injected into the cavity or the gap between the outer surface of the hollow core and the mold surface and the third plastic material thus injected is hardened, for example, by cooling, thereby forming an outer layer integrally on the outer surface of the hollow core, together with the spacer member. Preferably, the hollow core is fabricated by blow molding, together with the spacer member integrally. In this manner, since the spacer member is present between the hollow core and the cavity surface when the hollow core is placed in position in the mold cavity, a predetermined gap can be maintained between the hollow core and the cavity surface while the molten third plastic material is injected into the cavity. As a result, there can be formed an outer layer having a desired thickness and a desire shape across the entire surface of the hollow core. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011] In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided another method for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe. In accordance with this method, a plurality of mold segments are put together to define a mold cavity with a hollow plastic core placed inside the mold cavity. In this case, the mold segments are not completely put together, but a predetermined clearance is maintained between at least two of the mold segments such that the clearance may allow air to pass therethrough, but it does not allow any molten plastic material to pass therethrough. Under the condition, a plastic material in a molten state is supplied under pressure into the cavity, and, then, the mold segments are put together completely to thereby apply a pressure to the plastic material thus supplied into the cavity, so that an outer layer having a desired shape is integrally formed from a third plastic material on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow core in a unitary structure. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012] Preferably, in order to prevent the hollow core from being undesirably deformed during manufacture, the hollow plastic core may be filled with particles, such as sand, or a pressurized gas may be supplied into the interior of the hollow core at least while an external pressure is applied to the outer surface of the hollow core. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013] It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved plastic pipe and a method for manufacturing the same. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0014\" num=\"0014\">[0014] Another object of the present invention is to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having an increased durability and an enhanced heat-resistant characteristic and its manufacturing method. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0015\" num=\"0015\">[0015] A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved plastic pipe which can be used as an intake manifold and its manufacturing method. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0016\" num=\"0016\">[0016] A still further object of the present invention is to provide an improved plastic pipe simple in structure and thus easy to manufacture and low at cost. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0017\" num=\"0017\">[0017] Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </p>\\n    </summary-of-invention>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>\\n    <p id=\"P-0018\" num=\"0018\">[0018]FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration showing a multi-layered plastic pipe constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention;

The multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> includes a hollow member <b>11</b> which has been formed from a first plastic material into a desired shape, and a spacer member or projection <b>13</b> formed from a second plastic material to a predetermined height or thickness is provided at a predetermined location (at six places in the illustrated example) on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member <b>11</b>. And, an outer layer <b>12</b> is formed in a predetermined shape on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member <b>11</b> excepting where the spacer members <b>13</b> are provided. In the illustrated embodiment, the outer layer <b>12</b> is integrally formed with the hollow member <b>11</b> and the spacer members <b>13</b>, and the outer layer <b>13</b> has a thickness substantially equal to the thickness or height of each of the spacer members <b>13</b>. For example, the outer layer <b>12</b> may be integrally formed with the hollow member <b>11</b> and the spacer members <b>13</b> by adhesion or melting. The outer layer <b>12</b> defines a flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>at each end of the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b>, and each flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is formed with a plurality of mounting holes <b>12</b> <i>b. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0033\" num=\"0033\">[0033] In a preferred embodiment, the hollow member <b>11</b> is formed by blow molding and it has a desired shape with its center axis bent two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally. The spacer members <b>13</b> may be integrally formed at the same time when the hollow member <b>11</b> is formed by blow molding, or, alternatively, after forming the hollow member <b>11</b> by blow molding, the spacer members <b>13</b>, which have been made separately, may be integrally provided at predetermined locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow member <b>11</b>, for example, by using an adhesive or melting them together locally. The spacer members <b>13</b> may be made from a plastic material which is the same as or different from that of the hollow member <b>11</b>. Thus, the spacer members <b>13</b> may provide a locally different characteristic at a location where the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> is locally brought into contact with another member or where another member is to be mounted thereon. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0034\" num=\"0034\">[0034] The outer layer <b>12</b> is integrally formed with the hollow member <b>11</b>, but the outer layer <b>12</b> may be formed from a plastic material different from the plastic material of the hollow member <b>11</b>. As a result, the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> can be given a desired characteristic depending on the condition in which it is used. For example, since the hollow member <b>11</b> defines a flow passage for guiding the flow of a fluid, it can be formed from a plastic material having a desired characteristic required in connection with the flow of such fluid. For example, when the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> is to be used as an intake manifold of an engine, use is preferably made of a plastic material having an excellent anti-gasoline characteristic and anti-blow-by gas characteristic; whereas, when the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> is to be used as a radiator hose of an automobile, use is preferably made of a plastic material having an excellent anti-LLC characteristic. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0035\" num=\"0035\">[0035] The outer layer <b>12</b> has a specific object to provide a mechanical strength and/or anti-heat resistant characteristic to the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b>. Thus, although the outer layer <b>12</b> can be fabricated basically from the same plastic material as that of the hollow member <b>11</b>, it is preferable to use such a plastic material which also includes reinforcing materials, such as fibers or fillers. Such reinforcing materials typically include glass fibers, carbon fibers, talc and mica. Different plastic materials may be used for the hollow member <b>11</b>, spacer members <b>13</b> and outer layer <b>12</b> as long as they are soluble to each other. In the case where such a solubility does not exist by themselves, use may be made of an adhesive layer between the two plastic materials having no solubility therebetween. All of the hollow member <b>11</b>, spacer members <b>13</b> and outer layer <b>12</b> may be made from the same plastic material, if desired. The preferred plastic materials to be used for the hollow member <b>11</b> and spacer members <b>13</b> include nylon 6, nylon 6-6, nylon 6 or 6-6 (containing 20% of glass fibers), nylon 11 or 12, nylon 4-6 or 6-10 or 6-12, nylon family alloys, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PBT (polybutylene terephthalate), PES (polyether sulfone), PEEK (polyetheretherketone), polyimide and polyamideimide. On the other hand, the preferred plastic materials for forming the outer layer <b>12</b> include a mixture of each of the plastic materials listed above for forming the hollow member <b>11</b> with a desired percentage, such as 30%, of reinforcing materials, such as glass fibers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0036\" num=\"0036\">[0036] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, since the outer layer <b>12</b> is formed from a plastic material having an excellent mechanical strength, a flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>can be formed as a portion thereof. The flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is formed with a plurality of mounting holes <b>12</b> <i>b, </i>so that the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>can be directly mounted, for example, on a port of an engine or a radiator of an automobile using bolts and nuts. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the spacer members <b>13</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the hollow member <b>11</b>; however, such a spacer member <b>13</b> may be provided at least one location of the outer peripheral surface of the outer member <b>11</b>, so that the present invention should not be limited to such a specific arrangement of spacer members <b>13</b> as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. As will be described in detail later, the location and number of such spacer members <b>13</b> may be determined in accordance with the conditions in which the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> is used and with its manufacturing method used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0037\" num=\"0037\">[0037] Next, referring to FIGS. 4<i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>c</i>, a process for manufacturing the multi-layered plastic pipe <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0038\" num=\"0038\">[0038] As shown in FIG. 4<i>a</i>, in accordance with this embodiment, use is made of a pair of first mold half <b>15</b> and a second mold half <b>16</b>, which together define a complete mold when placed in contact together, and these first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are provided to be movable closer to each other or separated away from each other. In the illustrated embodiment, the first mold half <b>15</b> is provided fixed in position with its mating surface facing upwards, whereas, the second mold half <b>16</b> is provided to be movable vertically so that it can move closer toward or separated away from the associated, stationary first mold half <b>15</b>. The mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b> is formed with a first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>which has a predetermined shape and defines a first half of a mold cavity. A seat section <b>15</b> <i>b </i>is formed at each end of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, and these seat sections <b>15</b> <i>b </i>serve to hole a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> in position when it is placed in the first mold half <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. The first mold half <b>15</b> is also provided with a predetermined number of supply passages <b>17</b> which are in communication with a supply source <b>18</b> for supplying a plastic material. Thus, the third plastic material in a molten state is supplied from the supply source <b>18</b> into the cavity defined by the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> when brought into a semi-mating condition through these supply passages <b>17</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0039\" num=\"0039\">[0039] The second mold half <b>16</b> also has a mating surface which is brought into contact with the mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b>, and the mating surface of the second mold half <b>16</b> is also formed with a second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a </i>having a desired shape. As shown, a sliding core <b>19</b> is provided at each end of the second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and it is provided to be slidingly movable in a guide hole formed in the second mold half <b>16</b>. A spring is provided in the guide hole so that the sliding core is normally pressed outward to be located at its advanced location. The sliding core <b>19</b> has its front surface shaped to be commensurate with and thus to partly receive therein the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> and the front surface of the sliding core <b>19</b> may be brought into contact with the mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0040\" num=\"0040\">[0040] Now, a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe using a pair of first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> as described above will be described. In the first place, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is formed into a desired shape from a first plastic material, for example, by a blow molding technique. The tip end portion at each end of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> will be eventually removed; however, using these tip end portions, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is located in position in the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>by having its tip end portions placed on the seat sections <b>15</b> <i>b </i>of the first mold half <b>15</b> as shown in FIG. 4<i>a</i>. As shown, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is provided with a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> at selected locations on its outer peripheral surface. Preferably, these spacer members <b>13</b> are formed at the same time when the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is fabricated. In the present embodiment, since it is so structured that a third plastic material in a molten state is supplied into the cavity through supply passages <b>17</b> provided in the first mold half <b>15</b>, the spacer members <b>13</b> are provided only at the upper half of the outer peripheral surface of the horizontally extending hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. However, if desired, these spacer members <b>13</b> may also be provided at other locations of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> additionally. It is to be noted, however, that these spacer members <b>13</b> should be provided at such locations of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> which can counteract the force applied to the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> when the plastic material in a molten state is supplied into the cavity. As a result, in the-present embodiment, these spacer members <b>13</b> should be provided at least at an upper half of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> which extends horizontally. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0041\" num=\"0041\">[0041] Then, as shown in FIG. 4<i>b</i>, the second mold half <b>16</b> is lowered, during which, the sliding cores <b>19</b> are first brought into contact with the respective end portions of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> and with the mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b>. At this time, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position in the cavity defined between the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. When the second mold half <b>16</b> is further lowered, the sliding cores <b>19</b> are retracted into the respective guide holes of the second mold half <b>16</b> against the force of the springs <b>20</b> since the sliding cores <b>19</b> are in contact with the mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b>. When a clearance G between the two mating surfaces of the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> has reached a predetermined value (semi-mating condition), the second mold half <b>16</b> stops its descending motion. The value of clearance G in this case may be set at any desired value depending on the circumstances; however, it is typically set in a range between 2 and 5 mm. Under the condition, the third plastic material in a molten state is supplied from the supply source <b>18</b> into the cavity through the supply passages <b>17</b>. In this case, in the present embodiment, since the spacer members <b>13</b> are provided on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> on its outer peripheral surface at such locations opposite to the direction of supply of the third plastic material into the cavity, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is maintained in position with its spacer members <b>13</b> in contact with the surface of the second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a</i>, so that the third plastic material thus supplied is prevented from being biased in distribution inside the cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0042\" num=\"0042\">[0042] Then, after supplying the third plastic material sufficiently into the cavity, the supply of the third plastic material is terminated, and, as shown in FIG. 4<i>c</i>, the second mold half <b>16</b> is again caused to descend until the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into a complete mating condition in which the mating surface of the first mold half <b>15</b> in contact with the mating surface of the second mold half <b>16</b>. As a result, the third plastic material supplied into the cavity or the gap between the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> and the surface of each of the first and second mold grooves <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>a </i>is uniformly distributed across the entire cavity, thereby forming the outer layer <b>12</b> having a desired shape from the third plastic material and integral with the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. During this compression step, the third plastic material supplied into the cavity will be sufficiently supplied to a large volume section, such as a flange section. In addition, due to the provision of spacer members <b>13</b> at selected locations on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is prevented from deforming and the outer layer <b>12</b> having a desired shape and thickness can be integrally fabricated around the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, together with the spacer members <b>13</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0043\" num=\"0043\">[0043] In the case where the strength of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> itself is not sufficient and thus there is a possibility that the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> may be deformed during the above-described compression step, the internal space of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> may be filled with particles, such as sand. Alternatively, a pressurized gas may be supplied into the internal space of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> so as to balance the external force applied to the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> during the compression step to thereby prevent the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> from being deformed. In addition, if there is a possibility that the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> may come into contact with the surface of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>during the above-described compression step, the spacer members <b>13</b> may also be provided at the lower half of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0044\" num=\"0044\">[0044]FIG. 5 illustrates a modification to the process for forming a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flange as shown in FIGS. 4<i>a </i>through <b>4</b> <i>c</i>. That is, as shown in FIG. 5, a cylinder device <b>21</b> is mounted on the first mold half <b>15</b>, and a rod <b>21</b> <i>a </i>of the cylinder device <b>21</b> passes through a hole provided in the first mold half <b>15</b> so that the rod <b>21</b> <i>a </i>may move into the cavity or retract from the cavity. In particular, the rod <b>21</b> <i>a </i>may move into the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, when the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into a complete mating relationship to compress the third plastic material inside the cavity to thereby cause the third plastic material to be supplied to every section of the cavity uniformly, there is still a chance that the third plastic material fails to be properly supplied to the space of a flange forming portion of the cavity or properly compressed. Under the circumstances, during the compression step shown in FIG. 4<i>a</i>, by causing the rod <b>21</b> <i>a </i>to move into the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, an additional compression force may be applied locally to that portion <b>12</b>\u2032 of the third plastic material present in the space of a flange forming portion of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. In this case, a bore or hole is formed in the cylinder portion of the resulting product due to the rod <b>21</b> <i>a, </i>and such a bore or hole may be later defined as a through-hole to be used as a mounting hole <b>12</b> <i>b </i>of the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0045\" num=\"0045\">[0045] Next, referring to FIGS. 7<i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b</i>, the principle of determining the location where the spacer member <b>13</b> is to be disposed on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> based on the present invention will be described. In the case of FIG. 7<i>a</i>, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position by a pair of sliding cores <b>19</b> and a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity from a supply port <b>17</b> from below. In this case, since the central portion of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> tends to be lifted upward due to the incoming molten plastic material under pressure, a spacer member <b>13</b> must be provided on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> somewhere at an upper half of the outer peripheral surface thereof. In FIG. 7<i>a</i>, although a single spacer member <b>13</b> is shown to be provided at a location diametrically opposite to the supply port <b>17</b>, it is not always necessary to provide such a single spacer member <b>13</b> at a location opposite to the supply port <b>17</b> as shown, a desired number of such spacer members <b>13</b> may be provided on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> so as to prevent the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> from coming into contact with the surface of the cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0046\" num=\"0046\">[0046] In FIG. 7<i>b</i>, a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position by means of a pair of sliding cores <b>19</b> and a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity from a supply port <b>17</b> from above. In this case, since the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> tends to be pushed downward at its central portion when the molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity under pressure from the supply port <b>17</b>, a single spacer member <b>13</b> is provided on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> at its bottom diametrically opposite to the supply port <b>17</b> so as to prevent the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> from coming into contact with the surface of the cavity. Thus, fundamentally, it is only necessary to provide one or more spacer members <b>13</b> on that portion of the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> opposite to that side where a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure. However, it should also be noted that any desired number of such spacer members <b>13</b>, same or different in shape and size, may only need to be provided on any portion of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> so as to form the outer layer <b>12</b> of desired thickness depending on the shape of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> and the method of supplying a molten plastic material into the cavity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0047\" num=\"0047\">[0047] For example, as shown in FIG. 8<i>a</i>, a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> may be provided circumferentially around the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. In particular, in the case where the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> has a complicated shape and a molten plastic material is to be supplied into the cavity through a plurality of supply ports, it is preferable to provide a plurality of such spacer members <b>13</b> in the circumferential direction of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. Even when a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> are to be provided in the circumferential direction of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, they do not need to be provided on the same circumference at all times, and, instead, such spacer members <b>13</b> may also be provided circumferentially as shifted in the longitudinal direction of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> one from another. FIG. 8<i>b </i>illustrates the case in which a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> are defined by locally bending portions of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> in the form of radially projecting ridges. Such a profiled hollow plastic core <b>11</b> may be easily formed by using a mold whose cavity surface is provided with a plurality of grooves. FIG. 8<i>c </i>illustrates a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> having a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> partially buried therein, which can be manufactured by arranging a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> in the cavity surface as inserts when blow molding the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. FIG. 8<i>d </i>illustrates the case in which, after forming a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> by blow molding, a plurality of spacer members <b>13</b> which have been fabricated separately are fixedly attached to the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> by using an adhesive agent or by melting them together. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0048\" num=\"0048\">[0048] Next, with reference to FIGS. 9<i>a, </i> <b>9</b> <i>b, </i> <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b, </i>the structure of a mold suitable for use in a process of the present invention will be described in detail below. As shown in FIG. 9<i>a, </i>the first mold half <b>15</b> has a first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, and on the other hand the second mold half <b>16</b> has a second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. When the first and second mole halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought closer together with a gap or clearance G defined between the respective mating surfaces, a semi-mating condition is defined and a cavity is defined between the first and second mold grooves <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b</i>. A pair of projections <b>16</b> <i>b </i>is formed on the opposite sides of the second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a</i>, and these projections <b>16</b> <i>b </i>have a height larger than the clearance G. On the other hand, the opposite sides in the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>are so structured to be able to receive these projections <b>16</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. Thus, in the condition shown in FIG. 9<i>a, </i>the tip ends of these projections <b>16</b> <i>b </i>are partially fitted into the respective receiving sections of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>so that the cavity is set in its partially closed state or semi-mating condition. Under this semi-mating condition, air may pass through a clearance between the projection <b>16</b> <i>b </i>and its associated receiving section of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, but no molten plastic material is allowed to pass therethrough. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0049\" num=\"0049\">[0049] Accordingly, when a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity under pressure under this semi-mating condition, the air inside the cavity is allowed to be discharged out into the atmosphere through the clearance between the projection <b>16</b> <i>b </i>and the associated receiving section of the first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, whereas the molten plastic material thus supplied into the cavity is substantially prevented from flowing out of the cavity through such clearance. FIG. 9<i>b </i>illustrates the condition in which, after supplying a molten plastic material into the cavity, the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into a complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition, and, thus, FIG. 9<i>b </i>corresponds to FIG. 4<i>c; </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0050\" num=\"0050\">[0050]FIG. 10<i>a </i>illustrates the structure of another mold for use in another embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 10<i>a, </i>the first mold half <b>15</b> has a first mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>which is formed with a cut-away section <b>15</b> <i>c </i>at each side thereof, and the second mold half <b>16</b> has a second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a </i>which is formed with a pair of projections <b>16</b> <i>c </i>on the opposite sides thereof. In this case, as different from the embodiment shown in FIG. 9<i>b, </i>these projections <b>16</b> <i>c </i>have their sharp tip ends cut away to provide blunt ends. Accordingly, the projections <b>16</b> <i>c </i>of the present embodiment are improved in rigidity, and the shape of these projections <b>16</b> <i>c </i>are least affected or modified by repeated use. As a result, even if a large number of multi-layered plastic pipes are to be manufactured, an intended and same characteristic may be maintained. Moreover, in the present embodiment, as shown in FIG. 10<i>b, </i>even if the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are set in the complete mating condition, since the projections <b>16</b> <i>c </i>do not occupy the entire space defined by the cut-away sections <b>15</b> <i>c, </i>the resulting multi-layered plastic pipe will have a rib <b>12</b> <i>c </i>formed extending longitudinally as a part of the outer layer <b>12</b>. Such a rib <b>12</b> <i>c </i>is preferred in some cases since it would provide an increased strength and rigidity to the outer layer <b>12</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0051\" num=\"0051\">[0051] Next, various modifications and alternate embodiments of the present invention will now be described-below. FIGS. 11<i>a </i>through <b>11</b> <i>f </i>illustrate a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flexible or relatively soft fitting section at one end. As shown in FIG. 11<i>a, </i>in the first place, a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is fabricated by a blow molding technique. This hollow plastic core <b>11</b> includes a hard section <b>11</b>H comprised of a relatively hard plastic material and a soft section <b>11</b>S comprised of a relatively soft plastic material. As the relatively hard plastic material, use may, for example, be made of nylon 6, whereas, as the relatively soft plastic material, use may, for example, be made of nylon 11. In the case of blow molding a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> having a unitary structure from the two plastic materials different in hardness, the plastic material supplied to a nozzle to form a parison is switched from one material to another to thereby form a composite parison having two different plastic materials along different portions of its longitudinal axis and then the resulting composite parison may be subjected to blow molding to define a desired shape. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0052\" num=\"0052\">[0052] As best shown in FIG. 11<i>a, </i>the hollow plastic pipe <b>11</b> thus formed has unnecessary portions <b>11</b>H\u2032 and <b>11</b>S\u2032 at respective ends, and these unnecessary end portions <b>11</b>H\u2032 and <b>11</b>S\u2032 will be later removed. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 11<i>a</i>, the soft section <b>11</b>S is enlarged in diameter. On the other hand, in an embodiment shown in FIG. 11<i>b, </i>both of the hard and soft sections <b>11</b>H and <b>11</b>S have the same diameter. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0053\" num=\"0053\">[0053] As shown in FIG. 11<i>c, </i>the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> thus formed is then set in position in a cavity defined between first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. Then, as shown in FIG. 11<i>d, </i>a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through supply passages <b>17</b> provided in the first mold half <b>15</b>. The molten plastic material supplied in this case is normally a relatively hard plastic material, such as a mixture of nylon 6 and glass fibers (30%). Then, the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition and apply a compression force to the plastic material, so that an outer layer <b>12</b> is integrally formed on the outer surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. In this case, preferably, a pressurized gas is injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> or alternatively particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> in advance. In addition, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> as described before. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0054\" num=\"0054\">[0054] Then, upon hardening of the molten plastic material, the first and second mold halves are separated from each other and the resulting product molded under pressure is removed from the mold. The resulting product is shown in FIG. 11<i>e. </i>Then the undesired portions <b>11</b>H\u2032 and <b>11</b>S\u2032 are removed-from the product so that a desired multi-layered plastic pipe can be obtained as shown in FIG. 11<i>f. </i>FIG. 11<i>g </i>illustrates an embodiment where both of the hard and soft sections <b>11</b>H and <b>11</b>S have the same diameter. The resulting multi-layered plastic pipe has a flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>formed from a relatively hard plastic material at one end and a fitting portion <b>11</b>S formed from a relatively soft plastic material at the opposite end. The fitting portion <b>11</b>S is relatively soft and thus it may be fitted into or onto another pipe. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0055\" num=\"0055\">[0055] Now, referring to FIGS. 12<i>a </i>through <b>12</b> <i>c, </i>a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a bellowed section in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the first place, as shown in FIG. 12<i>a</i>, a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is fabricated by a blow molding technique. In this case, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> includes a hard section <b>11</b>H comprised of a relatively hard plastic material, such as nylon 6-6, and a bellows section <b>11</b>S comprised of a relatively soft plastic material, such as nylon 12. In addition, it also include an undesired portion <b>11</b>H\u2032, which will be removed later, at each end thereof. Then, the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> shown in FIG. <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is set in position in a cavity defined between the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, and a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through supply passages <b>17</b>. For such a molten plastic material, use may be made, for example, of a mixture of nylon 6-6 and glass fibers (for example, 30%). In this case, the molten plastic material is supplied onto the outer peripheral surface of the hard section <b>11</b>H excepting the bellows section <b>11</b>S. Then, mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into complete contact to thereby establish a complete mating condition and the molten plastic material thus supplied is hardened to form an outer layer <b>12</b> having a desired shape. In the present embodiment, the outer layer <b>12</b> will have a flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>at each end thereof. Preferably, during this compression step, a pressurized gas may be injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> or alternatively particles such as sand particles may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> in advance to prevent deformation from occurring on the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> due to an external force applied thereto. In addition, as described before, one or more of spacer members may be provided at selected locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hard section <b>11</b>H of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0056\" num=\"0056\">[0056] Upon completion of molding, the mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are separated to remove the resulting plastic product and its undesired end portions <b>11</b>H\u2032 are cut away. The resulting multi-layered plastic pipe is illustrated in FIG. 12<i>c. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0057\" num=\"0057\">[0057] Referring now to FIGS. 13<i>a </i>through <b>13</b> <i>d</i>, a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages will be-described in detail below. FIG. 13<i>a </i>illustrates a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> fabricated into a desired shape by blow molding. This hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, as shown in transverse cross section in FIG. 13<i>b, </i>is formed with a pair of upper and lower grooves <b>11</b> <i>a </i>whose bottoms are in contact to thereby define a pair of independent flow passages <b>11</b> <i>b. </i>Such a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position in a cavity defined between a pair of first and second mold halves in a manner described with respect to the before-mentioned embodiments, and then a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity, followed by the steps of bringing the two mold halves in complete contact to carry out forming under pressure. Upon completion of forming, the two mold halves are separated away from each other to remove the resulting product therefrom. And then the undesired end portions are cut away. As a result, there can be obtained a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages as shown in FIG. 13<i>c. </i>This multi-layered plastic pipe is formed with a flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>at each end thereof, and its cross sectional structure is illustrated in FIG. 13<i>d. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0058\" num=\"0058\">[0058] With reference to FIGS. 14<i>a </i>through <b>14</b> <i>c</i>, a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of flow passages in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention will now be described. As shown in FIG. 14<i>a</i>, in the first place, a plurality (two in the illustrated embodiment) of hollow plastic cores <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>2</b>, each having its own desired shape, are molded by blow molding. Then, as shown in FIG. 14<i>b</i>, these two hollow plastic cores <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> are set in position in a cavity defined between a pair of first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. Then, a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity and the two mold halves are brought into complete contact to thereby have the molten plastic material formed into a desired shape under compression. Upon completion of forming, the mold halves are separated away from each other to remove the resulting product and then the undesired end portions are cut away to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having a plurality of independent flow passages. The cross sectional structure of the resulting multi-layered plastic pipe is illustrated in FIG. 14<i>c. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0059\" num=\"0059\">[0059] Now, with reference to FIGS. 15<i>a </i>through <b>15</b> <i>f, </i>a process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe having a flange portion covered with a metal member in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the first place, as shown in FIG. <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is molded by a blow molding technique using a cap-shaped metal member <b>31</b> as an insert component. FIG. 15<i>b </i>illustrates the condition in which the cup-shaped metal member <b>31</b> is integrally formed with the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> by blow molding. Then, as shown in FIG. 15<i>c, </i>this hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position in a mold cavity. In this case, use may be made of a pair of first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> as described before, in which case, however, the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are formed with enlarged portions <b>16</b> <i>c </i>of the mold grooves for receiving therein a part of the metal member <b>31</b>, respectively. Therefore, in this case, the metal member <b>31</b> serves as a stopper for the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, and the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> may be set in position in the cavity when the metal member <b>31</b> is properly inserted into the enlarged portions <b>16</b> <i>c </i>of the mold grooves. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0060\" num=\"0060\">[0060] Then, as shown in FIG. 15<i>d, </i>a molten plastic material is supplied under pressure into the cavity through at least one supply passage <b>17</b> (not shown) provided in either of or both of the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. Then, the two mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into complete mating condition to carry out compression forming so that an outer layer <b>12</b> having a desired shape is integrally formed from the molten plastic material. In this case, however, it is preferable to supply a pressurized gas into the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, or, alternatively, particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> in advance so as to prevent the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> from being deformed during compression forming. Furthermore, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided at desired locations on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. Upon completion of forming, the mold halves are separated away from each other and the resulting product is removed from the mold. The resulting structure is shown in cross section in FIG. 15<i>e. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0061\" num=\"0061\">[0061] Then, the undesired portion <b>11</b>\u2032 of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> shown in FIG. 15<i>e </i>is cut away, and, as shown in FIG. 15<i>f, </i>one or more of mounting holes <b>12</b> <i>b </i>are formed passing through the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and the cup-shaped metal member <b>31</b>. In a multi-layered plastic pipe thus manufactured, since the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is covered with and thus reinforced by the metal member <b>31</b>, when the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is mounted, for example, on an object, such as an internal combustion engine, by bolts and nuts, the flange portion <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is prevented from being deformed due to bolt tightening, thereby allowing to provide a secure mounting structure. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0062\" num=\"0062\">[0062]FIGS. 16<i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>b </i>illustrate another process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe whose flange portion is reinforced by a metal member in accordance with a still further embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 15<i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b</i>, in the first place, a hollow plastic core <b>11</b> having a metal member <b>31</b> is formed by blow molding, and the resulting hollow plastic core <b>11</b> is set in position in a mold groove of the first mold half <b>15</b>. In this case, the first mold half <b>15</b> is formed with a mold groove <b>15</b> <i>a </i>having a predetermined shape, with an enlarged portion <b>15</b> <i>c </i>for partly receiving therein the metal member <b>32</b> and with a seat <b>15</b> <i>b </i>for holding thereon an end portion of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. On the other hand, the second mold half <b>16</b> is formed with a second mold groove <b>16</b> <i>a </i>having a predetermined shape and provided with a sliding core <b>19</b>, which may move between its advanced position and retracted position and is normally biased toward its advanced position by means of a spring <b>20</b>. The sliding core <b>19</b> is formed with a cut-away portion <b>19</b> <i>a </i>for receiving therein a part of the metal member <b>32</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0063\" num=\"0063\">[0063] With the above-described structure, when the second mold half <b>16</b> is lowered, the metal member <b>32</b> is placed into the cut-away portion <b>19</b> <i>a </i>of the sliding core <b>19</b>, and the second mold half <b>16</b> is further moved downward until the distance between the opposing mating surfaces of the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> becomes a predetermined gap G, wherein a semi-mating condition is set. This condition is illustrated in FIG. 16<i>b</i>. Under the condition, a molten plastic material is supplied into the cavity through supply passages <b>17</b> (not shown) provided in either one or both of the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. Thereafter, the first and second mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are brought into a complete mating condition by reducing the gap G zero to thereby carry out compression forming so that the molten plastic-material is formed into a desired shape around the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. Upon hardening of the molten plastic material, the mold halves <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> are separated away from each other and the resulting product is removed. Then, similarly as described before, an undesired portion is removed from the resulting product to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0064\" num=\"0064\">[0064] Also in the present embodiment, as described in each of the above-described embodiments, prior to the step of compression forming, a pressurized gas may be injected into the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>, or, alternatively, particles, such as sand, may be filled in the interior of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> so as to prevent the hollow plastic core <b>11</b> from being deformed when an external force is applied to the peripheral surface thereof. In addition, preferably, a desired number of spacer members may be provided at one or more selected portions on the outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core <b>11</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0065\" num=\"0065\">[0065] As described above, in accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a multi-layered plastic pipe excellent in heat-resistant characteristic and durability. In particular, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to provide a multi-layered plastic pipe having a uniform characteristic along the entire length of the plastic pipe by using a desired number of spacer members. Thus, a multi-layered plastic pipe of the present invention can have a characteristic extremely close to design conditions and thus high in reliability. Moreover, the present invention also provides a method or process for manufacturing a multi-layered plastic pipe high in reproducibility. Thus, there is provided a process capable for manufacturing various automobile components, such as intake manifolds and radiator hoses, which are exposed to high temperature and vigorous vibrations, from plastic materials. In particular, when applied as ducts to be used in automobiles, the components can be reduced in weight significantly, and, for example, a reduction in weight as much as 50% can be attained when the present invention is used as compared with the case of a prior art intake manifolds made of die-casted aluminum. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0066\" num=\"0066\">[0066] While the above provides a full and complete disclosure of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, various modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents may be employed without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the above description and illustration should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0001] 1. Field of the Invention  \\n       [0002] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for seamlessly reproducing a bitstream having non-sequential system clock data therein and, more specifically, to a bitstream for use in an authoring system for variously processing a data bitstream comprising the video data, audio data, and sub-picture data constituting each of plural program titles containing related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data content to generate a bitstream from which a new title containing the content desired by the user can be reproduced, and efficiently recording and reproducing said generated bitstream using a particular recording medium.  \\n       [0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art  \\n       [0004] Authoring systems used to produce program titles comprising related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data by digitally processing, for example, multimedia data comprising video, audio, and sub-picture data recorded to laser disk or video CD formats are currently available. Systems using Video-Cds in particular are able to record video data to a CD format disk, which was originally designed with an approximately 600 MB recording capacity for storing digital audio data only, by using such high efficiency video compression techniques as MPEG. As a result of the increased effective recording capacity achieved using data compression techniques, karaoke titles and other conventional laser disk applications are gradually being transferred to the video CD format.  \\n       [0005] Users today expect both sophisticated title content and high reproduction quality. To meet these expectations, each title must be composed from bitstreams with an increasingly deep hierarchical structure. The data size of multimedia titles written with bitstreams having such deep hierarchical structures, however, is ten or more times greater than the data size of less complex titles. The need to edit small image (title) details also makes it necessary to process and control the bitstream using low order hierarchical data units.  \\n       [0006] It is therefore necessary to develop and prove a bitstream structure and an advanced digital processing method including both recording and reproduction capabilities whereby a large volume, multiple level hierarchical digital bitstream can be efficiently controlled at each level of the hierarchy. Also needed are an apparatus for executing this digital processing method, and a recording media to which the bitstream digitally processed by said apparatus can be efficiently recorded for storage and from which said recorded information can be quickly reproduced.  \\n       [0007] Means of increasing the storage capacity of conventional optical disks have been widely researched to address the recording medium aspect of this problem. One way to increase the storage capacity of the optical disk is to reduce the spot diameter D of the optical (laser) beam. If the wavelength of the laser beam is 1 and the aperture of the objective lens is NA, then the spot diameter D is proportional to 1/NA, and the storage capacity can be efficiently improved by decreasing 1 and increasing NA.  \\n       [0008] As described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,581, however, coma caused by a relative tilt between the disk surface and the optical axis of the laser beam (hereafter \u201ctilt\u201d) increases when a large aperture (high NA) lens is used. To prevent tilt-induced coma, the transparent substrate must be made very thin. The problem is that the mechanical strength of the disk is low when the transparent substrate is very thin.  \\n       [0009] MPEG1, the conventional method of recording and reproducing video, audio, and graphic signal data, has also been replaced by the more robust MPEG2 method, which can transfer large data volumes at a higher rate. It should be noted that the compression method and data format of the MPEG2 standard differ somewhat from those of MPEG1. The specific content of and differences between MPEG1 and MPEG2 are described in detail in the ISO-11172 and ISO-13818 MPEG standards, and further description thereof is omitted below.  \\n       [0010] Note, however, that while the structure of the encoded video stream is defined in the MPEG2 specification, the hierarchical structure of the system stream and the method of processing lower hierarchical levels are not defined.  \\n       [0011] As described above, it is therefore not possible in a conventional authoring system to process a large data stream containing sufficient information to satisfy many different user requirements. Moreover, even if such a processing method were available, the processed data recorded thereto cannot be repeatedly used to reduce data redundancy because there is no large capacity recording medium currently available that can efficiently record and reproduce high volume bitstreams such as described above.  \\n       [0012] More specifically, particular significant hardware and software requirements must be satisfied in order to process a bitstream using a data unit smaller than the title. These specific hardware requirements include significantly increasing the storage capacity of the recording medium and increasing the speed of digital processing; software requirements include inventing an advanced digital processing method including a sophisticated data structure.  \\n       [0013] Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an effective authoring system for controlling a multimedia data bitstream with advanced hardware and software requirements using a data unit smaller than the title to better address advanced user requirements.  \\n       [0014] To share data between plural titles and thereby efficiently utilize optical disk capacity, multi-scene control whereby scene data common to plural titles and the desired scenes on the same time-base from within multi-scene periods containing plural scenes unique to particular reproduction paths can be freely selected and reproduced is desirable.  \\n       [0015] However, when plural scenes unique to a reproduction path within the multi-scene period are arranged on the same time-base, the scene data must be contiguous. Unselected multi-scene data is therefore unavoidably inserted between the selected common scene data and the selected multi-scene data. The problem this creates when reproducing multi-scene data is that reproduction is interrupted by this unselected scene data.  \\n       [0016] In other words, except when a VOB, which is normally a single-stream title editing unit, is divided into discrete streams, seamless reproduction cannot be achieved by simply connecting and reproducing individual VOB. This is because while the reproduction of video, audio, and sub-picture streams forming each VOB must be synchronized, the means for achieving this synchronization is enclosed in each VOB. As a result, the synchronization means will not function normally at VOB connections if the VOB are simply connected together.  \\n       [0017] The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a reproduction apparatus enabling seamless reproduction whereby scene data can be reproduced without intermittence even from these multi-scene periods.  \\n       [0018] The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an optical disk medium from which data can be seamlessly reproduced without audio or video intermitting even in such multi-scene periods, and reproducing apparatus implementing said recording and reproducing method.  \\n       [0019] The present application is based upon Japanese Patent Application No. 7-276710 and 8-041583, which were filed on Sep. 29, 1995 and Feb. 28, 1996, respectively, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein.  \\n       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0020] The present invention has been developed with a view to substantially solving the above described disadvantages and has for its essential object to provide an improved method and apparatus for reproducing bitstream having

stream data transferred to the corresponding signal processing decoders, and STC selectors for selecting a system clock STC referenced by the signal processing decoders when decoding the first system stream, and another system clock STC referenced by the signal processing decoders when decoding a second system stream reproduced contiguously to the first system stream. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n

Referenced to a motion picture (movie), one title may correspond to the content of an entire movie, or to just one scene within said movie.  \\n     [0099] A video title set (VTS) comprises the bitstream data containing the information for a specific number of titles. More specifically, each VTS comprises the video, audio, and other reproduction data representing the content of each title in the set, and control data for controlling the content data.  \\n     [0100] The video zone VZ is the video data unit processed by the authoring system, and comprises a specific number of video title sets. More specifically, each video zone is a linear sequence of K+1 video title sets numbered VTS # 0 -VTS #K where K is an integer value of zero or greater. One video title set, preferably the first video title set VTS # 0 , is used as the video manager describing the content information of the titles contained in each video title set.  \\n     [0101] The multimedia bitstream MBS is the largest control unit of the multimedia data bitstream handled by the authoring system of the present invention, and comprises plural video zones VZ.  \\n     [0102] Authoring Encoder EC  \\n     [0103] A preferred embodiment of the authoring encoder EC according to the present invention for generating a new multimedia bitstream MBS by re-encoding the original multimedia bitstream MBS according to the scenario desired by the user is shown in FIG. 2. Note that the original multimedia bitstream MBS comprises a video stream St 1  containing the video information, a sub-picture stream St 3  containing caption text and other auxiliary video information, and the audio stream St 5  containing the audio information.  \\n     [0104] The video and audio streams are the bitstreams containing the video and audio information obtained from the source within a particular period of time. The sub-picture stream is a bitstream containing momentary video information relevant to a particular scene. The sub-picture data encoded to a single scene may be captured to video memory and displayed continuously from the video memory for plural scenes as may be necessary.  \\n     [0105] When this multimedia source data St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  is obtained from a live broadcast, the video and audio signals are supplied in real-time from a video camera or other imaging source; when the multimedia source data is reproduced from a video tape or other recording medium, the audio and video signals are not real-time signals.  \\n     [0106] While the multimedia source stream is shown in FIG. 2 as comprising these three source signals, this is for convenience only, and it should be noted that the multimedia source stream may contain more than three types of source signals, and may contain source data for different titles. Multimedia source data with audio, video, and sub-picture data for plural titles are referred to below as multi-title streams.  \\n     [0107] As shown in FIG. 2, the authoring encoder EC comprises a scenario editor  100 , encoding system controller  200 , video encoder  300 , video stream buffer  400 , sub-picture encoder  500 , sub-picture stream buffer  600 , audio encoder  700 , audio stream buffer  800 , system encoder  900 , video zone formatter  1300 , recorder  1200 , and recording medium M.  \\n     [0108] The video zone formatter  1300  comprises video object (VOB) buffer  1000 , formatter  1100 , and volume and file structure formatter  1400 .  \\n     [0109] The bitstream encoded by the authoring encoder EC of the present embodiment is recorded by way of example only to an optical disk.  \\n     [0110] The scenario editor  100  of the authoring encoder EC outputs the scenario data, i.e., the user-defined editing instructions. The scenario data controls editing the corresponding parts of the multimedia bitstream MBS according to the user&#39;s manipulation of the video, sub-picture, and audio components of the original multimedia title. This scenario editor  100  preferably comprises a display, speaker(s), keyboard, CPU, and source stream buffer. The scenario editor  100  is connected to an external multimedia bitstream source from which the multimedia source data St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  are supplied.  \\n     [0111] The user is thus able to reproduce the video and audio components of the multimedia source data using the display and speaker to confirm the content of the generated title. The user is then able to edit the title content according to the desired scenario using the keyboard, mouse, and other command input devices while confirming the content of the title on the display and speakers. The result of this multimedia data manipulation is the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0112] The scenario data St 7  is basically a set of instructions describing what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user. Based on the instructions received through the keyboard or other control device, the CPU codes the position, length, and the relative time-based positions of the edited parts of the-respective multimedia source data streams St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  to generate the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0113] The source stream buffer has a specific capacity, and is used to delay the multimedia source data streams St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  a known time Td and then output streams St 1 , St 3 , and St 5 .  \\n     [0114] This delay is required for synchronization with the editor encoding process. More specifically, when data encoding and user generation of scenario data St 7  are executed simultaneously, i.e., when encoding immediately follows editing, time Td is required to determine the content of the multimedia source data editing process based on the scenario data St 7  as will be described further below. As a result, the multimedia source data must be delayed by time Td to synchronize the editing process during the actual encoding operation. Because this delay time Td is limited to the time required to synchronize the operation of the various system components in the case of sequential editing as described above, the source stream buffer is normally achieved by means of a high speed storage medium such as semiconductor memory.  \\n     [0115] During batch editing in which all multimedia source data is encoded at once (\u201cbatch encoded\u201d) after scenario data St 7  is generated for the complete title, delay time Td must be long enough to process the complete title or longer. In this case, the source stream buffer may be a low speed, high capacity storage medium such as video tape, magnetic disk or optical disk.  \\n     [0116] The structure (type) of media used for the source stream buffer may therefore be determined according to the delay time Td required and the allowable manufacturing cost.  \\n     [0117] The encoding system controller  200  is connected to the scenario editor  100  and receives the scenario data St 7  therefrom. Based on the time-base position and length information of the edit segment contained in the scenario data St 7 , the encoding system controller  200  generates the encoding parameter signals St 9 , St 11 , and St 13  for encoding the edit segment of the multimedia source data. The encoding signals St 9 , St 11 , and St 13  supply the parameters used for video, sub-picture, and audio encoding, including the encoding start and end timing. Note that multimedia source data St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  are output after delay time Td by the source stream buffer, and are therefore synchronized to encoding parameter signals St 9 , St 11 , and St 13 .  \\n     [0118] More specifically, encoding parameter signal St 9  is the video encoding signal specifying the encoding timing of video stream St 1  to extract the encoding segment from the video stream St 1  and generate the video encoding unit. Encoding parameter signal St 11  is likewise the sub-picture stream encoding signal used to generate the sub-picture encoding unit by specifying the encoding timing for sub-picture stream St 3 . Encoding parameter signal St 13  is the audio encoding signal used to generate the audio encoding unit by specifying the encoding timing for audio stream St 5 .  \\n     [0119] Based on the time-base relationship between the encoding segments of streams St 1 , St 3 , and St 5  in the multimedia source data contained in scenario data St 7 , the encoding system controller  200  generates the timing signals St 21 , St 23 , and St 25  arranging the encoded multimedia-encoded stream in the specified time-base relationship.  \\n     [0120] The encoding system controller  200  also generates the reproduction time information IT defining the reproduction time of the title editing unit (video object, VOB), and the stream encoding data St 33  defining the system encode parameters for multiplexing the encoded multimedia stream containing video, audio, and sub-picture data. Note that the reproduction time information IT and stream encoding data St 33  are generated for the video object VOB of each title in one video zone VZ.  \\n     [0121] The encoding system controller  200  also generates the title sequence control signal St 39 , which declares the formatting parameters for formatting the title editing units VOB of each of the streams in a particular time-base relationship as a multimedia bitstream. More specifically, the title sequence control signal St 39  is used to control the connections between the title editing units (VOB) of each title in the multimedia bitstream MBS, or to control the sequence of the interleaved title editing unit (VOBs) interleaving the title editing units VOB of plural reproduction paths.  \\n     [0122] The video encoder  300  is connected to the source stream buffer of the scenario editor  100  and to the encoding system controller  200 , and receives therefrom the video stream St 1  and video encoding parameter signal St 9 , respectively. Encoding parameters supplied by the video encoding signal St 9  include the encoding start and end timing, bit rate, the encoding conditions for the encoding start and end, and the material type. Possible material types include NTSC or PAL video signal, and telecine converted material. Based on the video encoding parameter signal St 9 , the video encoder  300  encodes a specific part of the video stream St 1  to generate the encoded video stream St 15 .  \\n     [0123] The sub-picture encoder  500  is similarly connected to the source stream buffer of the scenario editor  100  and to the encoding system controller  200 , and receives therefrom the sub-picture stream St 3  and sub-picture encoding parameter signal St 11 , respectively. Based on the sub-picture encoding parameter signal St 11 , the sub-picture encoder  500  encodes a specific part of the sub-picture stream St 3  to generate the encoded sub-picture stream St 17 .  \\n     [0124] The audio encoder  700  is also connected to the source stream buffer of the scenario editor  100  and to the encoding system controller  200 , and receives therefrom the audio stream St 5  and audio encoding parameter signal St 13 , which supplies the encoding start and end timing. Based on the audio encoding parameter signal St 13 , the audio encoder  700  encodes a specific part of the audio stream St 5  to generate the encoded audio stream St 19 .  \\n     [0125] The video stream buffer  400  is connected to the video encoder  300  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The video stream buffer  400  stores the encoded video stream St 15  input from the video encoder  300 , and outputs the stored encoded video stream St 15  as the time-delayed encoded video stream St 27  based on the timing signal St 21  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0126] The sub-picture stream buffer  600  is similarly connected to the sub-picture encoder  500  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The sub-picture stream buffer  600  stores the encoded sub-picture stream St 17  output from the sub-picture encoder  500 , and then outputs the stored encoded sub-picture stream St 17  as time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St 29  based on the timing signal St 23  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0127] The audio stream buffer  800  is similarly connected to the audio encoder  700  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The audio stream buffer  800  stores the encoded audio stream St 19  input from the audio encoder  700 , and then outputs the encoded audio stream St 19  as the time-delayed encoded audio stream St 31  based on the timing signal St 25  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0128] The system encoder  900  is connected to the video stream buffer  400 , sub-picture stream buffer  600 , audio stream buffer  800 , and the encoding system controller  200 , and is respectively supplied thereby with the time-delayed encoded video stream St 27 , time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St 29 , time-delayed encoded audio stream St 31 , and the stream encoding data St 33 . Note that the system encoder  900  is a multiplexer that multiplexes the time-delayed streams St 27 , St 29 , and St 31  based on the stream encoding data St 33  (timing signal) to generate title editing unit (VOB) St 35 . The stream encoding data St 33  contains the system encoding parameters, including the encoding start and end timing.  \\n     [0129] The video zone formatter  1300  is connected to the system encoder  900  and the encoding system controller  200  from which the title editing unit (VOB) St 35  and title sequence control signal St 39  (timing signal) are respectively supplied. The title sequence control signal St 39  contains the formatting start and end timing, and the formatting parameters used to generate (format) a multimedia bitstream MBS. The video zone formatter  1300  rearranges the title editing units (VOB) St 35  in one video zone VZ in the scenario sequence defined by the user based on the title sequence control signal St 39  to generate the edited multimedia stream data St 43 .  \\n     [0130] The multimedia bitstream MBS St 43  edited according to the user-defined scenario is then sent to the recorder  1200 . The recorder  1200  processes the edited multimedia stream data St 43  to the data stream St 45  format of the recording medium M, and thus records the formatted data stream St 45  to the recording medium M. Note that the multimedia bitstream MBS recorded to the recording medium M contains the volume file structure VFS, which includes the physical address of the data on the recording medium generated by the video zone formatter  1300 .  \\n     [0131] Note that the encoded multimedia bitstream MBS St 35  may be output directly to the decoder to immediately reproduce the edited title content. It will be obvious that the output multimedia bitstream MBS will not in this case contain the volume file structure VFS.  \\n     [0132] Authoring Decoder  \\n     [0133] A preferred embodiment of the authoring decoder DC used to decode the multimedia bitstream MBS edited by the authoring encoder EC of the present invention, and thereby reproduce the content of each title unit according to the user-defined scenario, is described next below with reference to FIG. 3. Note that in the preferred embodiment described below the multimedia bitstream St 45  encoded by the authoring encoder EC is recorded to the recording medium M.  \\n     [0134] As shown in FIG. 3, the authoring decoder DC comprises a multimedia bitstream producer  2000 , scenario selector  2100 , decoding system controller  2300 , stream buffer  2400 , system decoder  2500 , video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , audio buffer  2800 , synchronizer  2900 , video decoder  3800 , sub-picture decoder  3100 , audio decoder  3200 , synthesizer  3500 , video data output terminal  3600 , and audio data output terminal  3700 .  \\n     [0135] The bitstream producer  2000  comprises a recording media drive unit  2004  for driving the recording medium M; a reading head  2006  for reading the information recorded to the recording medium M and producing the binary read signal St 57 ; a signal processor  2008  for variously processing the read signal St 57  to generate the reproduced bitstream St 61 ; and a reproduction controller  2002 .  \\n     [0136] The reproduction controller  2002  is connected to the decoding system controller  2300  from which the multimedia bitstream reproduction control signal St 53  is supplied, and in turn generates the reproduction control signals St 55  and St 59  respectively controlling the recording media drive unit (motor)  2004  and signal processor  2008 .  \\n     [0137] So that the user-defined video, sub-picture, and audio portions of the multimedia title edited by the authoring encoder EC are reproduced, the authoring decoder DC comprises a scenario selector  2100  for selecting and reproducing the corresponding scenes (titles). The scenario selector  2100  then outputs the selected titles as scenario data to the authoring decoder DC.  \\n     [0138] The scenario selector  2100  preferably comprises a keyboard, CPU, and monitor. Using the keyboard, the user then inputs the desired scenario based on the content of the scenario input by the authoring encoder EC. Based on the keyboard input, the CPU generates the scenario selection data St 51  specifying the selected scenario. The scenario selector  2100  is connected by an infrared communications device, for example, to the decoding system controller  2300 , to which it inputs the scenario selection data St 51 .  \\n     [0139] Based on the scenario selection data St 51 , the decoding system controller  2300  then generates the bitstream reproduction control signal St 53  controlling the operation of the bitstream producer  2000 .  \\n     [0140] The stream buffer  2400  has a specific buffer capacity used to temporarily store the reproduced bitstream St 61  input from the bitstream producer  2000 , extract the address information and initial synchronization data SCR (system clock reference) for each stream, and generate bitstream control data St 63 . The stream buffer  2400  is also connected to the decoding system controller  2300 , to which it supplies the generated bitstream control data St 63 .  \\n     [0141] The synchronizer  2900  is connected to the decoding system controller  2300  from which it receives the system clock reference SCR contained in the synchronization control data St 81  to set the internal system clock STC and supply the reset system clock St 79  to the decoding system controller  2300 .  \\n     [0142] Based on this system clock St 79 , the decoding system controller  2300  also generates the stream read signal St 65  at a specific interval and outputs the read signal St 65  to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0143] Based on the supplied read signal St 65 , the stream buffer  2400  outputs the reproduced bitstream St 61  at a specific interval to the system decoder  2500  as bitstream St 67 .  \\n     [0144] Based on the scenario selection data St 51 , the decoding system controller  2300  generates the decoding signal St 69  defining the stream Ids for the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams corresponding to the selected scenario, and outputs to the system decoder  2500 .  \\n     [0145] Based on the instructions contained in the decoding signal St 69 , the system decoder  2500  respectively outputs the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams input from the stream buffer  2400  to the video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , and audio buffer  2800  as the encoded video stream St 71 , encoded sub-picture stream St 73 , and encoded audio stream St 75 .  \\n     [0146] The system decoder  2500  detects the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS of the smallest control unit in each bitstream St 67  to generate the time information signal St 77 . This time information signal St 77  is supplied to the synchronizer  2900  through the decoding system controller  2300  as the synchronization control data St 81 .  \\n     [0147] Based on this synchronization control data St 81 , the synchronizer  2900  determines the decoding start timing whereby each of the bitstreams will be arranged in the correct sequence after decoding, and then generates and inputs the video stream decoding start signal St 89  to the video decoder  3800  based on this decoding timing. The synchronizer  2900  also generates and supplies the sub-picture decoding start signal St 91  and audio stream decoding start signal St 93  to the sub-picture decoder  3100  and audio decoder  3200 , respectively.  \\n     [0148] The video decoder  3800  generates the video output request signal St 84  based on the video stream decoding start signal St 89 , and outputs to the video buffer  2600 . In response to the video output request signal St 84 , the video buffer  2600  outputs the video stream St 83  to the video decoder  3800 . The video decoder  3800  thus detects the presentation time information contained in the video stream St 83 , and disables the video output request signal St 84  when the length of the received video stream St 83  is equivalent to the specified presentation time. A video stream equal in length to the specified presentation time is thus decoded by the video decoder  3800 , which outputs the reproduced video signal St 104  to the synthesizer  3500 .  \\n     [0149] The sub-picture decoder  3100  similarly generates the sub-picture output request signal St 86  based on the sub-picture decoding start signal St 91 , and outputs to the sub-picture buffer  2700 . In response to the sub-picture output request signal St 86 , the sub-picture buffer  2700  outputs the sub-picture stream St 85  to the sub-picture decoder  3100 . Based on the presentation time information contained in the sub-picture stream St 85 , the sub-picture decoder  3100  decodes a length of the sub-picture stream St 85  corresponding to the specified presentation time to reproduce and supply to the synthesizer  3500  the sub-picture signal St 99 .  \\n     [0150] The synthesizer  3500  superimposes the video signal St 104  and sub-picture signal St 99  to generate and output the multi-picture video signal St 105  to the video data output terminal  3600 .  \\n     [0151] The audio decoder  3200  generates and supplies to the audio buffer  2800  the audio output request signal St 88  based on the audio stream decoding start signal St 93 . The audio buffer  2800  thus outputs the audio stream St 87  to the audio decoder  3200 . The audio decoder  3200  decodes a length of the audio stream St 87  corresponding to the specified presentation time based on the presentation time information contained in the audio stream St 87 , and outputs the decoded audio stream St 101  to the audio data output terminal  3700 .  \\n     [0152] It is thus possible to reproduce a user-defined multimedia bitstream MBS in real-time according to a user-defined scenario. More specifically, each time the user selects a different scenario, the authoring decoder DC is able to reproduce the title content desired by the user in the desired sequence by reproducing the multimedia bitstream MBS corresponding to the selected scenario.  \\n     [0153] It is therefore possible by means of the authoring system of the present invention to generate a multimedia bitstream according to plural user-defined scenarios by real-time or batch encoding multimedia source data in a manner whereby the substreams of the smallest editing units (scenes), which can be divided into plural substreams, expressing the basic title content are arranged in a specific time-base relationship.  \\n     [0154] The multimedia bitstream thus encoded can then be reproduced according to the one scenario selected from among plural possible scenarios. It is also possible to change scenarios while playback is in progress, i.e., to select a different scenario and dynamically generate a new multimedia bitstream according to the most recently selected scenario. It is also possible to dynamically select and reproduce any of plural scenes while reproducing the title content according to a desired scenario.  \\n     [0155] It is therefore possible by means of the authoring system of the present invention to encode and not only reproduce but to repeatedly reproduce a multimedia bitstream MBS in real-time.  \\n     [0156] A detail of the authoring system is disclosed Japanese Patent Application filed Sep. 27, 1996, and entitled and assigned to the same assignee as the present application.  \\n     [0157] Digital Video Disk (DVD)  \\n     [0158] An example of a digital video disk (DVD) with only one recording surface (a single-sided DVD) is shown in FIG. 4.  \\n     [0159] The DVD recording medium RC 1  in the preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a data recording surface RS 1  to and from which data is written and read by emitting laser beam LS, and a protective layer PL 1  covering the data recording surface RS 1 . A backing layer BL 1  is also provided on the back of data recording surface RS 1 . The side of the disk on which protective layer PL 1  is provided is therefore referred to below as side SA (commonly \u201cside A\u201d), and the opposite side (on which the backing layer BL 1  is provided) is referred to as side SB (\u201cside B\u201d). Note that digital video disk recording media having a single data recording surface RS 1  on only one side such as this DVD recording medium RC 1  is commonly called a single-sided single layer disk.  \\n     [0160] A detailed illustration of area C 1  in FIG. 4 is shown in FIG. 5. Note that the data recording surface RS 1  is formed by applying a metallic thin film or other reflective coating as a data layer  4109  on a first transparent layer  4108  having a particular thickness T 1 . This first transparent layer  4108  also functions as the protective layer PL 1 . A second transparent substrate  4111  of a thickness T 2  functions as the backing layer BL 1 , and is bonded to the first transparent layer  4108  by means of an adhesive layer  4110  disposed therebetween.  \\n     [0161] A printing layer  4112  for printing a disk label may also be disposed on the second transparent substrate  4111  as necessary. The printing layer  4112  does not usually cover the entire surface area of the second transparent substrate  4111  (backing layer BL 1 ), but only the area needed to print the text and graphics of the disk label. The area of second transparent substrate  4111  to which the printing layer  4112  is not formed may be left exposed. Light reflected from the data layer  4109  (metallic thin film) forming the data recording surface RS 1  can therefore be directly observed where the label is not printed when the digital video disk is viewed from side SB. As a result, the background looks like a silver-white over which the printed text and graphics float when the metallic thin film is an aluminum thin film, for example.  \\n     [0162] Note that it is only necessary to provide the printing layer  4112  where needed for printing, and it is not necessary to provide the printing layer  4112  over the entire surface of the backing layer BL 1 .  \\n     [0163] A detailed illustration of area C 2  in FIG. 5 is shown in FIG. 6. Pits and lands are molded to the common contact surface between the first transparent layer  4108  and the data layer  4109  on side SA from which data is read by emitting a laser beam LS, and data is recorded by varying the lengths of the pits and lands (i.e., the length of the intervals between the pits). More specifically, the pit and land configuration formed on the first transparent layer  4108  is transferred to the data layer  4109 . The lengths of the pits and lands is shorter, and the pitch of the data tracks formed by the pit sequences is narrower, than with a conventional Compact Disc (CD). The surface recording density is therefore greatly improved.  \\n     [0164] Side SA of the first transparent layer  4108  on which data pits are not formed is a flat surface. The second transparent substrate  4111  is for reinforcement, and is a transparent panel made from the same material as the first transparent layer  4108  with both sides flat. Thicknesses T 1  and T 2  are preferably equal and commonly approximately 0.6 mm, but the invention shall not be so limited.  \\n     [0165] As with a CD, information is read by irradiating the surface with a laser beam LS and detecting the change in the reflectivity of the light spot. Because the objective lens aperture NA can be large and the wavelength  1  of the light beam small in a digital video disk system, the diameter of the light spot Ls used can be reduced to approximately 1/1.6 the light spot needed to read a CD. Note that this means the resolution of the laser beam LS in the DVD system is approximately 1.6 times the resolution of a conventional CD system.  \\n     [0166] The optical system used to read data from the digital video disk uses a short 650 nm wavelength red semiconductor laser and an-objective lens with a 0.6 mm aperture NA. By thus also reducing the thickness T of the transparent panels to 0.6 mm, more than 5 GB of data can be stored to one side of a 120 mm diameter optical disk.  \\n     [0167] It is therefore possible to store motion picture (video) images having an extremely large per unit data size to a digital video disk system disk without losing image quality because the storage capacity of a single-sided, single-layer recording medium RC 1  with one data recording surface RS 1  as thus described is nearly ten times the storage capacity of a conventional CD. As a result, while the video presentation time of a conventional CD system is approximately 74 minutes if image quality is sacrificed, high quality video images with a video presentation time exceeding two hours can be recorded to a DVD.  \\n     [0168] The digital video disk is therefore well-suited as a recording medium for video images.  \\n     [0169] A digital video disk recording medium with plural recording surfaces RS as described above is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. The DVD recording medium RC 2  shown in FIG. 7 comprises two recording surfaces, i.e., first recording surface RS 1  and semi-transparent second recording surface RS 2 , on the same side, i.e. side SA, of the disk. Data can be simultaneously recorded or reproduced from these two recording surfaces by using different laser beams LS 1  and LS 2  for the first recording surface RS 1  and the second recording surface RS 2 . It is also possible to read/write both recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  using only one of the laser beams LS 1  or LS 2 . Note that recording media thus comprised are called \u201csingle-side, dual-layer disks.\u201d \\n     [0170] It should also be noted that while two recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  are provided in this example, it is also possible to produce digital video disk recording media having more than two recording surfaces RS. Disks thus comprised are known as \u201csingle-sided, multi-layer disks.\u201d \\n     [0171] Though comprising two recording surfaces similarly to the recording media shown in FIG. 7, the DVD recording medium RC 3  shown in FIG. 8 has the recording surfaces on opposite sides of the disk, i. e., has the first data recording surface RS 1  on side SA and the second data recording surface RS 2  on side SB. It will also be obvious that while only two recording surfaces are shown on one digital video disk in this example, more than two recording surfaces may also be formed on a double-sided digital video disk. As with the recording medium shown in FIG. 7, it is also possible to provide two separate laser beams LS 1  and LS 2  for recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2 , or to read/write both recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  using a single laser beam. Note that this type of digital video disk is called a \u201cdouble-sided, dual-layer disk.\u201d It will also be obvious that a double-sided digital video disk can be comprised with two or more recording surfaces per side. This type of disk is called a \u201cdouble-sided, multi-layer disk.\u201d \\n     [0172] A plan view from the laser beam LS irradiation side of the recording surface RS of the DVD recording medium RC is shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10. Note that a continuous spiral data recording track TR is provided from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the DVD. The data recording track TR is divided into plural sectors each having the same known storage capacity. Note that for simplicity only the data recording track TR is shown in FIG. 9 with more than three sectors per revolution.  \\n     [0173] As shown in FIG. 9, the data recording track TR is normally formed clockwise inside to outside (see arrow DrA) from the inside end point IA at the inside circumference of disk RCA to the outside end point OA at the outside circumference of the disk with the disk RCA rotating counterclockwise RdA. This type of disk RCA is called a clockwise disk, and the recording track formed thereon is called a clockwise track TRA.  \\n     [0174] Depending upon the application, the recording track TRB may be formed clockwise from outside to inside circumference (see arrow DrB in FIG. 10) from the outside end point OB at the outside circumference of disk RCB to the inside end point IB at the inside circumference of the disk with the disk RCB rotating clockwise RdB. Because the recording track appears to wind counterclockwise when viewed from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on disks with the recording track formed in the direction of arrow DrB, these disks are referred to as counterclockwise disk RCB with counterclockwise track TRB to distinguish them from disk RCA in FIG. 9. Note that track directions DrA and DrB are the track paths along which the laser beam travels when scanning the tracks for recording and playback. Direction of disk rotation RdA in which disk RCA turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrA, and direction of disk rotation RdB in which disk RCB turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrB.  \\n     [0175] An exploded view of the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC 2  shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC 2 o in FIG. 11. Note that the recording tracks formed on the two recording surfaces run in opposite directions. Specifically, a clockwise recording track TRA as shown in FIG. 9 is formed in clockwise direction DrA on the (lower) first data recording surface RS 1 , and a counterclockwise recording track TRB formed in counterclockwise direction DrB as shown in FIG. 10 is provided on the (upper) second data recording surface RS 2 . As a result, the outside end points OA and OB of the first and second (top and bottom) tracks are at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC 2 o. Note that track paths DrA and DrB of tracks TR are also the data read/write directions to disk RC. The first and second (top and bottom) recording tracks thus wind opposite each other with this disk RC, i.e., the track paths DrA and DrB of the top and bottom recording layers are opposite track paths.  \\n     [0176] Opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disks RC 2 o rotate in direction RdA corresponding to the first recording surface RS 1  with the laser beam LS travelling along track path DrA to trace the recording track on the first recording surface RS 1 . When the laser beam LS reaches the outside end point OA, the laser beam LS can be refocused to end point OB on the second recording surface RS 2  to continue tracing the recording track from the first to the second recording surface uninterrupted. The physical distance between the recording tracks TRA and TRB on the first and second recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  can thus be instantaneously eliminated by simply adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS.  \\n     [0177] It is therefore possible with an opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC 2   o  to easily process the recording tracks disposed to physically discrete top and bottom recording surfaces as a single continuous recording track. It is therefore also possible in an authoring system as described above with reference to FIG. 1 to continuously record the multimedia bitstream MBS that is the largest multimedia data management unit to two discrete recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  on a single recording medium RC 2 o.  \\n     [0178] It should be noted that the tracks on recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  can be wound in the directions opposite those described above, i.e., the counterclockwise track TRB may be provided on the first recording surface RS 1  and the clockwise track TRA on the second recording surface RS 2 . In this case the direction of disk rotation is also changed to a clockwise rotation RdB, thereby enabling the two recording surfaces to be used as comprising a single continuous recording track as described above. For simplification, a further example of this type of disk is therefore neither shown nor described below.  \\n     [0179] It is therefore possible by thus constructing the digital video disk to record the multimedia bitstream MBS for a feature-length title to a single opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC 2 o. Note that this type of digital video disk medium is called a single-sided dual-layer disk with opposite track paths.  \\n     [0180] Another example of the single-sided, dual-layer DVD recording medium RC 2  shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC 2 p in FIG. 12. The recording tracks formed on both first and second recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  are clockwise tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9. In this case, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC 2 p rotates counterclockwise in the direction of arrow RdA, and the direction of laser beam LS travel is the same as the direction of the track spiral, i.e., the track paths of the top and bottom recording surfaces are mutually parallel (parallel track paths). The outside end points OA of both top and bottom tracks are again preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC 2 p as described above. As also described above with disk RC 2 o shown in FIG. 11, the access point can be instantaneously shifted from outside end point OA of track TRA on the first recording surface RS 1  to the outside end point OA of track TRA on the second recording surface RS 2  by appropriately adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS at outside end point OA.  \\n     [0181] However, for the laser beam LS to continuously access the clockwise recording track TRA on the second recording surface RS 2 , the recording medium RC 2 p must be driven in the opposite direction (clockwise, opposite direction RdA). Depending-on the radial position of the laser beam LS, however, it is inefficient to change the rotational direction of the recording medium. As shown by the diagonal arrow in FIG. 12, the laser beam LS is therefore moved from the outside end point OA of the track on the first recording surface RS 1  to the inside end point IA of the track on the second recording surface RS 2  to use these physically discrete recording tracks as one logically continuous recording track.  \\n     [0182] Rather than using the recording tracks on top and bottom recording surfaces as one continuous recording track, it is also possible to use the recording tracks to record the multimedia bitstreams MBS for different titles. This type of digital video disk recording medium is called a \u201csingle-sided, dual-layer disk with parallel track paths.\u201d \\n     [0183] Note that if the direction of the tracks formed on the recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  is opposite that described above, i.e., counterclockwise recording tracks TRB are formed, disk operation remains the same as that described above except for the direction of disk rotation, which is clockwise as shown by arrow RdB.  \\n     [0184] Whether using clockwise or counterclockwise recording tracks, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC 2 p with parallel track paths thus described is well-suited to storing on a single disk encyclopedia and similar multimedia bitstreams comprising multiple titles that are frequently and randomly accessed.  \\n     [0185] An exploded view of the dual-sided single-layer DVD recording medium RC 3  comprising one recording surface layer RS 1  and RS 2  on each side as shown in FIG. 8 is shown as DVD recording medium RC 3   s  in FIG. 13. Clockwise recording track TRA is provided on the one recording surface RS 1 , and a counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided on the other recording surface RS 2 . As in the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OB of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC 3   s.    \\n     [0186] Note that while the recording tracks on these recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  rotate in opposite directions, the track paths are symmetrical. This type of recording medium is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths. This double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC 3   s  rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS 1 . As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS 2  on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrB in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrA. Accessing both recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  using a single laser beam LS is therefore not realistic irrespective of whether access is continuous or non-continuous. In addition, a multimedia bitstream MBS is separately recorded to the recording surfaces on the first and second sides of the disk.  \\n     [0187] A different example of the double-sided single layer disk RC 3  shown in FIG. 8 is shown in FIG. 14 as disk RC 3   a.  Note that this disk -comprises clockwise recording tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9 on both recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2 . As with the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OA of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC 3   a.  Unlike the double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC 3   s  described above, the tracks on these recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  are asymmetrical. This type of disk is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths. This double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC 3   a  rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS 1 . As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS 2  on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrA in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrB.  \\n     [0188] This means that if a laser beam LS is driven continuously from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on the first recording surface RS 1 , and then from the outside circumference to the inside circumference on the second recording surface RS 2 , both sides of the recording medium RC 3   a  can be read/written without turning the disk over and without providing different laser beams for the two sides.  \\n     [0189] The track paths for recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2  are also the same with this double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC 3   a.  As a result, it is also possible to read/write both sides of the disk without providing separate-laser beams for each side if the recording medium RC 3   a  is turned over between sides, and the read/write apparatus can therefore be constructed economically.  \\n     [0190] It should be noted that this recording medium remains functionally identical even if counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided in place of clockwise recording track TRA on both recording surfaces RS 1  and RS 2 .  \\n     [0191] As described above, the true value of a DVD system whereby the storage capacity of the recording medium can be easily increased by using a multiple layer recording surface is realized in multimedia applications whereby plural video data units, plural audio data units, and plural graphics data units recorded to a single disk are reproduced through interactive operation by the user.  \\n     [0192] It is therefore possible to achieve one long-standing desire of software (programming) providers, specifically, to provide programming content such as a commercial movie on a single recording medium in plural versions for different language and demographic groups while retaining the image quality of the original.  \\n     [0193] Parental Control  \\n     [0194] Content providers of movie and video titles have conventionally had to produce, supply, and manage the inventory of individual titles in multiple languages, typically the language of each distribution market, and multi-rated title packages conforming to the parental control (censorship) regulations of individual countries in Europe and North America. The time and resources required for this are significant. While high image quality is obviously important, the programming content must also be consistently reproducible.  \\n     [0195] The digital video disk recording medium is close to solving these problems.  \\n     [0196] Multiple Angles  \\n     [0197] One interactive operation widely sought in multimedia applications today is for the user to be able to change the position from which a scene is viewed during reproduction of that scene. This capability is achieved by means of the multiple angle function.  \\n     [0198] This multiple angle function makes possible applications whereby, for example, a user can watch a baseball game from different angles (or virtual positions in the stadium), and can freely switch between the views while viewing is in progress. In this example of a baseball game, the available angles may include a position behind the backstop centered on the catcher, batter, and pitcher; one from behind the backstop centered on a fielder, the pitcher, and the catcher; and one from center field showing the view to the pitcher and catcher.  \\n     [0199] To meet these requirements, the digital video disk system uses MPEG, the same basic standard format used with Video-Cds to record the video, audio, graphics, and other signal data. Because of the differences in storage capacity, transfer rates, and signal processing performance within the reproduction apparatus, DVD uses MPEG2, the compression method and data format of which differ slightly from the MPEG1 format used with Video-Cds.  \\n     [0200] It should be noted that the content of and differences between the MPEG1 and MPEG2 standards have no direct relationship to the intent of the present invention, and further description is therefore omitted below (for more information, see MPEG specifications ISO-11172 and IS 0 -13818).  \\n     [0201] The data structure of the DVD system according to the present invention is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. 16, 17,  18 ,  19 ,  20 , and  21 .  \\n     [0202] Multi-scene Control  \\n     [0203] A fully functional and practical parental lock playback function and multi-angle scene playback function must enable the user to modify the system output in minor, subtle ways while still presenting substantially the same video and audio output. If these functions are achieved by preparing and recording separate titles satisfying each of the many possible parental lock and multi-angle scene playback requests, titles that are substantially identical and differ in only minor ways must be recorded to the recording medium. This results in identical data being repeatedly recorded to the larger part of the recording medium, and significantly reduces the utilization efficiency of the available storage capacity. More particularly, it is virtually impossible to record discrete titles satisfying every possible request even using the massive capacity of the digital video disk medium. While it may be concluded that this problem can be easily solved by increasing the capacity of the recording medium, this is an obviously undesirable solution when the effective use of available system resources is considered.  \\n     [0204] Using multi-scene control, the concept of which is described in another section below, in a DVD system, it is possible to dynamically construct titles for numerous variations of the same basic content using the smallest possible amount of data, and thereby effectively utilize the available system resources (recording medium). More specifically, titles that can be played back with numerous variations are constructed from basic (common) scene periods containing data common to each title, and multi-scene periods comprising groups of different scenes corresponding to the various requests. During reproduction, the user is able to freely and at any time select particular scenes from the multi-scene periods to dynamically construct a title conforming to the desired content, e.g., a title omitting certain scenes using the parental lock control function.  \\n     [0205] Note that multi-scene control enabling a parental lock playback control function and multi-angle scene playback is described in another section below with reference to FIG. 21.  \\n     [0206] Data Structure of the DVD System  \\n     [0207] The data structure used in the authoring system of a digital video disk system according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 22. To record a multimedia bitstream MBS, this digital video disk system divides the recording medium into three major recording areas, the lead-in area LI, the volume space VS, and the lead-out area LO.  \\n     [0208] The lead-in area LI is provided at the inside circumference area of the optical disk. In the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, the lead-in area LI is positioned at the inside end points IA and IB of each track. Data for stabilizing the operation of the reproducing apparatus when reading starts is written to the lead-in area LI.  \\n     [0209] The lead-out area LO is correspondingly located at the outside circumference of the optical disk, i.e., at outside end points OA and OB of each track in the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. Data identifying the end of the volume space VS is recorded in this lead-out area LO.  \\n     [0210] The volume space VS is located between the lead-in area LI and lead-out area LO, and is recorded as a one-dimensional array of n+1 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to zero) 2048-byte logic sectors LS. The logic sectors LS are sequentially number # 0 , # 1 , # 2 , . . . #n. The volume space VS is also divided into a volume and file structure management area VFS and a file data structure area FDS.  \\n     [0211] The volume and file structure management area VFS comprises m+1 logic sectors LS# 0  to LS#m (where m is an integer greater than or equal to zero and less than n. The file data structure FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS #m+1 to LS #n.  \\n     [0212] Note that this file data structure area FDS corresponds to the multimedia bitstream MBS shown in FIG. 1 and described above.  \\n     [0213] The volume file structure VFS is the file system for managing the data stored to the volume space VS as files, and is divided into logic sectors LS# 0 -LS#m where m is the number of sectors required to store all data needed to manage the entire disk, and is a natural number less than n. Information for the files stored to the file data structure area FDS is written to the volume file structure VFS according to a known specification such as ISO-9660 or ISO-13346.  \\n     [0214] The file data structure area FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS#m-LS#n, each comprising a video manager VMG sized to an integer multiple of the logic sector (2048\u00d7I, where I is a known integer), and k video title sets VTS # 1 -VTS#k (where k is a natural number less than 100).  \\n     [0215] The video manager VMG stores the title management information for the entire disk, and information for building a volume menu used to set and change reproduction control of the entire volume.  \\n     [0216] Any video title set VTS #k is also called a \u201cvideo file\u201d representing a title comprising video, audio, and/or still image data.  \\n     [0217] The internal structure of each video title set VTS shown in FIG. 22 is shown in FIG. 16. Each video title set VTS comprises VTS information VTSI describing the management information for the entire disk, and the VTS title video objects VOB (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the system stream of the multimedia bitstream. The VTS information VTSI is described first below, followed by the VTS title VOBS.  \\n     [0218] The VTS information primarily includes the VTSI management table VTSI_MAT and VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT.  \\n     [0219] The VTSI management table VTSI_MAT stores such information as the internal structure of the video title set VTS, the number of selectable audio streams contained in the video title set VTS, the number of sub-pictures, and the video title set VTS location (storage address).  \\n     [0220] The VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT records i (where i is a natural number) program chain (PGC) data blocks VTS_PGCI # 1 -VTS_PGCI #i for controlling the playback sequence. Each of the table entries VTS_PGCI #i is a data entry expressing the program chain, and comprises j (where j is a natural number) cell playback information blocks C_PBI # 1 -C_PBI #j. Each cell playback information block C_PBI #j contains the playback sequence of the cell and playback control information.  \\n     [0221] The program chain PGC is a conceptual structure describing the story of the title content, and therefore defines the structure of each title by describing the cell playback sequence. Note that these cells are described in detail below.  \\n     [0222] If, for example, the video title set information relates to the menus, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts. If the user then presses a MENU button on a remote control device, for example, during playback, the playback device references the buffer to fetch the menu information and display the top menu # 1 . If the menus are hierarchical, the main menu stored as program chain information VTS_PGCI # 1  may be displayed, for example, by pressing the MENU button, VTS_PGCI # 2 -# 9  may correspond to submenus accessed using the numeric keypad on the remote control, and VTS_PGCI # 10  and higher may correspond to additional submenus further down the hierarchy. Alternatively, VTS_PGCI # 1  may be the top menu displayed by pressing the MENU button, while VTS_PGCI # 2  and higher may be voice guidance reproduced by pressing the corresponding numeric key.  \\n     [0223] The menus themselves are expressed by the plural program chains defined in this table. As a result, the menus may be freely constructed in various ways, and shall not be limited to hierarchical or non-hierarchical menus or menus containing voice guidance.  \\n     [0224] In the case of a movie, for example, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts, the playback device references the cell playback sequence described by the program chain PGC, and reproduces the system stream.  \\n     [0225] The \u201ccells\u201d referenced here may be all or part of the system stream, and are used as access points during playback. Cells can therefore be used, for example, as the \u201cchapters\u201d into which a title may be divided.  \\n     [0226] Note that each of the PGC information entries C_PBI #j contain both cell playback processing information and a cell information table. The cell playback processing information comprises the processing information needed to reproduce the cell, such as the presentation time and number of repetitions. More specifically, this information includes the cell block mode CBM, cell block type CBT, seamless playback flag SPF, interleaved allocation flag IAF, STC resetting flag STCDF, cell presentation time C_PBTM, seamless angle change flag SACF, first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA, and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA.  \\n     [0227] Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information. Seamless playback is described in detail in another section below with reference to FIG. 23 and FIG. 24.  \\n     [0228] The cell block mode CBM indicates whether plural cells constitute one functional block. The cell playback information of each cell in a functional block is arranged consecutively in the PGC information. The cell block mode CBM of the first cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the first cell in the block, and the cell block mode CBM of the last cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the last cell in the block. The cell block mode CBM of each cell arrayed between these first and last cells contains a value indicating that the cell is a cell between these first and last cells in that block.  \\n     [0229] The cell block type CBT identifies the type of the block indicated by the cell block mode CBM. For example, when a multiple angle function is enabled, the cell information corresponding to each of the reproducible angles is programmed as one of the functional blocks mentioned above, and the type of these functional blocks is defined by a value identifying \u201cangle\u201d in the cell block type CBT for each cell in that block.  \\n     [0230] The seamless playback flag SPF simply indicates whether the corresponding cell is to be linked and played back seamlessly with the cell or cell block reproduced immediately therebefore. To seamlessly reproduce a given cell with the preceding cell or cell block, the seamless playback flag SPF is set to 1 in the cell playback information for that cell; otherwise SPF is set to 0.  \\n     [0231] The interleaved allocation flag IAF stores a value identifying whether the cell exists in a contiguous or interleaved block. If the cell is part of an interleaved block, the flag IAF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0.  \\n     [0232] The STC resetting flag STCDF identifies whether the system time clock STC used for synchronization must be reset when the cell is played back; when resetting the system time clock STC is necessary, the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1.  \\n     [0233] The seamless angle change flag SACF stores a value indicating whether a cell in a multi-angle period should be connected seamlessly at an angle change. If the angle change is seamless, the seamless angle change flag SACF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0.  \\n     [0234] The cell presentation time C_PBTM expresses the cell presentation time with video frame precision.  \\n     [0235] The first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the first cell in a block, and is also expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by the number of sectors.  \\n     [0236] The last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the last cell in the block. The value of this address is expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by the number of sectors.  \\n     [0237] The VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the multimedia system stream data, is described next. The system stream data VTSTT_VOBS comprises i (where i is a natural number) system streams SS, each of which is referred to as a \u201cvideo object\u201d (VOB). Each video object VOB # 1 -VOB #i comprises at least one video data block interleaved with up to a maximum eight audio data blocks and up to a maximum 32 sub-picture data blocks.  \\n     [0238] Each video object VOB comprises q (where q is a natural number) cells C# 1 -C#q. Each cell C comprises r (where r is a natural number) video object units VOBU # 1 -VOBU #r.  \\n     [0239] Each video object unit VOBU comprises plural groups_of_pictures GOP, and the audio and sub-pictures corresponding to the playback of said plural groups_of_pictures GOP. Note that the group_of_pictures GOP corresponds to the video encoding refresh cycle. Each video object unit VOBU also starts with an NV pack, i.e., the control data for that VOBU.  \\n     [0240] The structure of the navigation packs NV is described with reference to FIG. 19.  \\n     [0241] Before describing the navigation pack NV, the internal structure of the video zone VZ (see FIG. 22), i.e., the system stream St 35  encoded by the authoring encoder EC described with reference to FIG. 25, is described with reference to FIG. 17. Note that the encoded video stream St 15  shown in FIG. 17 is the compressed one-dimensional video data stream encoded by the video encoder  300 . The encoded audio stream St 19  is likewise the compressed one-dimensional audio data stream multiplexing the right and left stereo audio channels encoded by the audio encoder  700 . Note that the audio signal shall not be limited to a stereo signal, and may also be a multichannel surround-sound signal.  \\n     [0242] The system stream (title editing unit VOB) St 35  is a one dimensional array of packs with a byte size corresponding to the logic sectors LS #n having a 2048-byte capacity as described using FIG. 22. A stream control pack is placed at the beginning of the title editing unit (VOB) St 35 , i.e., at the beginning of the video object unit VOBU. This stream control pack is called the \u201cnavigation pack NV\u201d, and records the data arrangement in the system stream and other control information.  \\n     [0243] The encoded video stream St 15  and the encoded audio stream St 19  are packetized in byte units corresponding to the system stream packs. These packets are shown in FIG. 17 as packets V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , V 4  . . . and A 1 , A 2 , A 3  . . . . As shown in FIG. 17, these packets are interleaved in the appropriate sequence as system stream St 35 , thus forming a packet stream, with consideration given to the decoder buffer size and the time required by the decoder to expand the video and audio data packets. In the example shown in FIG. 17, the packet stream is interleaved in the sequence V 1 , V 2 , A 1 , V 3 , V 4 , A 2  . . . .  \\n     [0244] Note that the sequence shown in FIG. 17 interleaves one video data unit with one audio data unit. significantly increased recording/playback capacity, high speed recording/playback, and performance improvements in the signal processing LSI enable the DVD system to record plural audio data and plural sub-picture data (graphics data) to one video data unit in a single interleaved MPEG system stream, and thereby enable the user to select the specific audio data and sub-picture data to be reproduced during playback. The structure of the system stream used in this type of DVD system is shown in FIG. 18 and described below.  \\n     [0245] As in FIG. 17, the packetized encoded video stream St 15  is shown in FIG. 18 as V 1 , V 2 , V 3 , V 4 , . . . In this example, however, there is not just one encoded audio stream St 19 , but three encoded audio streams St 19 A, St 19 B, and St 19 C input as the source data. There are also two encoded sub-picture streams St 17 A and St 17 B input as the source data sub-picture streams. These six compressed data streams, St 15 , St 19 A, St 19 B, St 19 C, St 17 A and St 17 B, are interleaved to a single system stream St 35 .  \\n     [0246] The video data is encoded according to the MPEG specification with the group_of_pictures GOP being the unit of compression. In general, each group_of_pictures GOP contains 15 frames in the case of an NTSC signal, but the specific number of frames compressed to one GOP is variable. The stream management pack, which describes the management data containing, for example, the relationship between interleaved data, is also interleaved at the GOP unit interval. Because the group_of_pictures GOP unit is based on the video data, changing the number of video frames per GOP unit changes the interval of the stream management packs. This interval is expressed in terms of the presentation time on the digital video disk within a range from 0.4 sec. to 1.0 sec. referenced to the GOP unit. If the presentation time of contiguous plural GOP units is less than 1 sec., the management data packs for the video data of the plural GOP units is interleaved to a single stream.  \\n     [0247] These management data packs are referred to as navigation packs NV in the digital video disk system. The data from one navigation pack NV to the packet immediately preceding the next navigation pack NV forms one video object unit VOBU. In general, one contiguous playback unit that can be defined as one scene is called a video object VOB, and each video object VOB contains plural video object units VOBU. Data sets of plural video objects VOB form a VOB set (VOBS). Note that these data units were first used in the digital video disk.  \\n     [0248] When plural of these data streams are interleaved, the navigation packs NV defining the relationship between the interleaved packs must also be interleaved at a defined unit known as the pack number unit. Each group_of_pictures GOP is normally a unit containing approximately 0.5 sec. of video data, which is equivalent to the presentation time required for 12-15 frames, and one navigation pack NV is generally interleaved with the number of data packets required for this presentation time.  \\n     [0249] The stream management information contained in the interleaved video, audio, and sub-picture data packets constituting the system stream is described below with reference to FIG. 19 As shown in FIG. 19, the data contained in the system stream is recorded in a format packed or packetized according to the MPEG2 standard. The packet structure is essentially the same for video, audio, and sub-picture data. One pack in the digital video disk system has a 2048 byte capacity as described above, and contains a pack header PKH and one packet PES; each packet PES contains a packet header PTH and data block.  \\n     [0250] The pack header PKH records the time at which that pack is to be sent from stream buffer  2400  to system decoder  2500  (see FIG. 26), i.e., the system clock reference SCR defining the reference time for synchronized audio-visual data playback. The MPEG standard assumes that the system clock reference SCR is the reference clock for the entire decoder operation. With such disk media as the digital video disk, however, time management specific to individual disk players can be used, and a reference clock for the decoder system is. therefore separately provided.  \\n     [0251] The packet header-PTH similarly contains a presentation time stamp PTS and a decoding time stamp DTS, both of which are placed in the packet before the access unit (the decoding unit). The presentation time stamp PTS defines the time at which the video data or audio data contained in the packet should be output as the playback output after being decoded, and the decoding time stamp DTS defines the time at which the video stream should be decoded. Note that the presentation time stamp PTS effectively defines the display start timing of the access unit, and the decoding time stamp DTS effectively defines the decoding start timing of the access unit. If the PTS and DTS are the same time, the DTS is omitted.  \\n     [0252] The packet header PTH also contains an 8-bit field called the stream ID identifying the packet type, i.e., whether the packet is a video packet containing a video data stream, a private packet, or an MPEG audio packet.  \\n     [0253] Private packets under the MPEG2 standard are data packets of which the content can be freely defined. Private packet  1  in this embodiment of the invention is used to carry audio data other than the MPEG audio data, and sub-picture data; private packet  2  carries the PCI packet and DSI packet.  \\n     [0254] Private packets  1  and  2  each comprise a packet header, private data area, and data area. The private data area contains an 8-bit sub-stream ID indicating whether the recorded data is audio data or sub-picture data. The audio data defined by private packet  2  may be defined as any of eight types # 0 -# 7  of linear PCM or AC-3 encoded data. Sub-picture data may be defined as one of up to 32 types # 0  -# 31 .  \\n     [0255] The data area is the field to which data compressed according to the MPEG2 specification is written if the stored data is video data; linear PCM, AC-3, or MPEG encoded data is written if audio data is stored; or graphics data compressed by runlength coding is written if sub-picture data is stored.  \\n     [0256] MPEG2-compressed video data may be compressed by constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR) coding. With constant bit rate coding, the video stream is input continuously to the video buffer at a constant rate. This contrasts with variable bit rate coding in which the video stream is input intermittently to the video buffer, thereby making it possible to suppress the generation of unnecessary code. Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate coding can be used in the digital video disk system.  \\n     [0257] Because MPEG video data is compressed with variable length coding, the data quantity in each group_of_pictures GOP is not constant. The video and audio decoding times also differ, and the time-base relationship between the video and audio data read from an optical disk, and the time-base relationship between the video and audio data output from the decoder, do not match. The method of time-base synchronizing the video and audio data is therefore described in detail below with reference to FIG. 26, but is described briefly below based on constant bit rate coding.  \\n     [0258] The navigation pack NV structure is shown in FIG. 20. Each navigation pack NV starts with a pack header PKH, and contains a PCI packet and DSI packet.  \\n     [0259] As described above, the pack header PKH records the time at which that pack is to be sent from stream buffer  2400  to system decoder  2500  (see FIG. 26), i.e., the system clock reference SCR defining the reference time for synchronized audio-visual data playback.  \\n     [0260] Each PCI packet contains PCI General Information (PCI_GI) and Angle Information for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGLI).  \\n     [0261] The PCI General Information (PCI_GI) declares the display time of the first video frame (the Start PTM of VOBU (VOBU_S_PTM)), and the display time of the last video frame (End PTM of VOBU (VOBU_E_PTM)), in the corresponding video object unit VOBU with system clock precision (90 Khz).  \\n     [0262] The Angle Information for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGLI) states the read start address of the corresponding video object unit VOBU when the angle is changed expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the video object VOB. Because there are nine or fewer angles in this example, there are nine angle address declaration cells: Destination Address of Angle Cell # 1  for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGL_C 1 _DSTA) to Destination Address of Angle Cell # 9  for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGL_C 9 _DSTA).  \\n     [0263] Each DSI packet contains DSI General Information (DSI_GI), Seamless Playback Information (SML_PBI), and Angle Information for Seamless playback (SML_AGLI).  \\n     [0264] The DSI General Information (DSI_GI) declares the address of the last pack in the video object unit VOBU, i. e., the End Address for VOB (VOBU_EA), expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the video object unit VOBU.  \\n     [0265] While seamless playback is described in detail later, it should be noted that the continuously read data units must be interleaved (multiplexed) at the system stream level as an interleaved unit ILVU in order to seamlessly reproduce split or combined titles. Plural system streams interleaved with the interleaved unit ILVU as the smallest unit are defined as an interleaved block.  \\n     [0266] The Seamless Playback Information (SML_PBI) is declared to seamlessly reproduce the stream interleaved with the interleaved unit ILVU as the smallest data unit, and contains an Interleaved Unit Flag (ILVU flag) identifying whether the corresponding video object unit VOBU is an interleaved block. The ILVU flag indicates whether the video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block, and is set to 1 when it is. Otherwise the ILVU flag is set to 0.  \\n     [0267] When a video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block, a Unit END flag is declared to indicate whether the video object unit VOBU is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU. Because the interleaved unit ILVU is the data unit for continuous reading, the Unit END flag is set to 1 if the VOBU currently being read is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU. Otherwise the Unit END flag is set to 0.  \\n     [0268] An Interleaved Unit End Address (ILVU_EA) identifying the address of the last pack in the ILVU to which the VOBU belongs, and the starting address of the next interleaved unit ILVU, Next Interleaved Unit Start Address (NT_ILVU_SA), are also declared when a video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block. Both the Interleaved Unit End Address (ILVU_EA) and Next Interleaved Unit Start Address (NT_ILVU_SA) are expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU.  \\n     [0269] When two system streams are seamlessly connected but the audio components of the two system streams are not contiguous, particularly immediately before and after the seam, it is necessary to pause the audio output to synchronize the audio and video components of the system stream following the seam. Note that non-contiguous audio may result from different audio signals being recording with the corresponding video blocks. With an NTSC signal, for example, the video frame cycle is approximately 33. 33 msec while the AC-3 audio frame cycle is 32 msec.  \\n     [0270] To enable this resynchronization, audio reproduction stopping times  1  and  2 , i.e., Audio Stop PTM  1  in VOB (VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 ), and Audio Stop PTM 2  in VOB (VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 ), indicating the time at which the audio is to be paused; and audio reproduction stopping periods  1  and  2 , i.e., Audio Gap Length  1  in VOB (VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 ) and Audio Gap Length  2  in VOB (VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 ), indicating for how long the audio is to be paused, are also declared in the DSI packet. Note that these times are specified at the system clock precision (90 Khz).  \\n     [0271] The Angle Information for Seamless playback (SML_AGLI) declares the read start address when the angle is changed. Note that this field is valid when seamless, multi-angle control is enabled. This address is also expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU. Because there are nine or fewer angles, there are nine angle address declaration cells: Destination Address of Angle Cell # 1  for Seamless playback (SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA) to Destination Address of Angle Cell # 9  for Seamless playback (SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA).  \\n     [0272] Note also that each title is edited in video object (VOB) units. Interleaved video objects (interleaved title editing units) are referenced as \u201cVOBS\u201d; and the encoded range of the source data is the encoding unit.  \\n     [0273] DVD Encoder  \\n     [0274] A preferred embodiment of a digital video disk system authoring encoder ECD in which the multimedia bitstream authoring system according to the present invention is applied to a digital video disk system is described below and shown in FIG. 25. It will be obvious that the authoring encoder ECD applied to the digital video disk system, referred to below as a DVD encoder, is substantially identical to the authoring encoder EC shown in FIG. 2. The basic difference between these encoders is the replacement in the DVD encoder ECD of the video zone formatter  1300  of the authoring encoder EC above with a VOB buffer  1000  and formatter  1100 . It will also be obvious that the bitstream encoded by this DVD encoder ECD is recorded to a digital video disk medium M. The operation of this DVD encoder ECD is therefore described below in comparison with the authoring encoder EC described above.  \\n     [0275] As in the above authoring encoder EC, the encoding system controller  200  generates control signals St 9 , St 11 , St 13 , St 21 , St 23 , St 25 , St 33 , and St 39  based on the scenario data St 7  describing the user-defined editing instructions input from the scenario editor  100 , and controls the video encoder  300 , sub-picture encoder  500 , and audio encoder  700  in the DVD encoder ECD. Note that the user-defined editing instructions in the DVD encoder ECD are a superset of the editing instructions of the authoring encoder EC described above.  \\n     [0276] Specifically, the user-defined editing instructions (scenario data St 7 ) in the DVD encoder ECD similarly describe what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user. The scenario data St 7  of the DVD encoder ECD, however, further contains such information as: the number of streams contained in the editing units, which are obtained by splitting a multi-title source stream into blocks at a constant time interval; the number of audio and sub-picture data cells contained in each stream, and the sub-picture display time and period; whether the title is a multi-rated title enabling parental lock control; whether the user content is selected from plural streams including, for example, multiple viewing angles; and the method of connecting scenes when the angle is switched among the multiple viewing angles.  \\n     [0277] The scenario data St 7  of the DVD encoder ECD also contains control information on a video object VOB unit basis. This information is required to encode the media source stream, and specifically includes such information as whether there are multiple angles or parental control features. When multiple angle viewing is enabled, the scenario data St 7  also contains the encoding bit rate of each stream considering data interleaving and the disk capacity, the start and end times of each control, and whether a seamless connection should be made between the preceding and following streams.  \\n     [0278] The encoding system controller  200  extracts this information from the scenario data St 7 , and generates the encoding information table and encoding parameters required for encoding control. The encoding information table and encoding parameters are described with reference to FIGS. 27, 28, and  29  below.  \\n     [0279] The stream encoding data St 33  contains the system stream encoding parameters and system encoding start and end timing values required by the DVD system to generate the VOBs. These system stream encoding parameters include the conditions for connecting one video object VOB with those before and after, the number of audio streams, the audio encoding information and audio Ids, the number of sub-pictures and the sub-picture Ids, the video playback starting time information VPTS, and the audio playback starting time information APTS.  \\n     [0280] The title sequence control signal St 39  supplies the multimedia bitstream MBS formatting start and end timing information and formatting parameters declaring the reproduction control information and interleave information.  \\n     [0281] Based on the video encoding parameter and encoding start/end timing signal St 9 , the video encoder  300  encodes a specific part of the video stream St 1  to generate an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in ISO-13818. This elementary stream is output to the video stream buffer  400  as encoded video stream St 15 .  \\n     [0282] Note that while the video encoder  300  generates an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in ISO-13818, specific encoding parameters are input via the video encoding parameter signal St 9 , including the encoding start and end timing, bit rate, the encoding conditions for the encoding start and end, the material type, including whether the material is an NTSC or PAL video signal or telecine converted material, and whether the encoding mode is set for either open GOP or closed GOP encoding.  \\n     [0283] The MPEG2 coding method is basically an interframe coding method using the correlation between frames for maximum signal compression, i.e., the frame being coded (the target frame) is coded by referencing frames before and/or after the target frame. However, intra-coded frames, i. e., frames that are coded based solely on the content of the target frame, are also inserted to avoid error propagation and enable accessibility from mid-stream (random access). The coding unit containing at least one intra-coded frame (\u201cintra-frame\u201d) is called a group_of_pictures GOP.  \\n     [0284] A group_of_pictures GOP in which coding is closed completely within that GOP is known as a \u201cclosed GOP.\u201d A group_of_pictures GOP containing a frame coded with reference to a frame in a preceding or following (ISO-13818 DOES NOT LIMIT P- and B-picture CODING to referencing PAST frames) group_of_pictures GOP is an \u201copen GOP.\u201d It is therefore possible to playback a closed GOP using only that GOP. Reproducing an open GOP, however, also requires the presence of the referenced GOP, generally the GOP preceding the open GOP.  \\n     [0285] The GOP is often used as the access unit. For example, the GOP may be used as the playback start point for reproducing a title from the middle, as a transition point in a movie, or for fast-forward play and other special reproduction modes. High speed reproduction can be achieved in such cases by reproducing only the intra-frame coded frames in a GOP or by reproducing only frames in GOP units.  \\n     [0286] Based on the sub-picture stream encoding parameter signal St 11 , the sub-picture encoder  500  encodes a specific part of the sub-picture stream St 3  to generate a variable length coded bitstream of bitmapped data. This variable length coded bitstream data is output as the encoded sub-picture stream St 17  to the sub-picture stream buffer  600 .  \\n     [0287] Based on the audio encoding parameter signal St 13 , the audio encoder  700  encodes a specific part of the audio stream St 5  to generate the encoded audio data. This encoded audio data may be data based on the MPEG1 audio standard defined in ISO-11172 and the MPEG2 audio standard defined in ISO-13818, AC-3 audio data, or PCM (LPCM) data. Note that the methods and means of encoding audio data according to these standards are known and commonly available.  \\n     [0288] The video stream buffer  400  is connected to the video encoder  300  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The video stream buffer  400  stores the encoded video stream St 15  input from the video encoder  300 , and outputs the stored encoded video stream St 15  as the time-delayed encoded video stream St 27  based on the timing signal St 21  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0289] The sub-picture stream buffer  600  is similarly connected to the sub-picture encoder  500  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The sub-picture stream buffer  600  stores the encoded sub-picture stream St 17  input from the sub-picture encoder  500 , and then outputs the stored encoded sub-picture stream St 17  as time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St 29  based on the timing signal St 23  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0290] The audio stream buffer  800  is similarly connected to the audio encoder  700  and to the encoding system controller  200 . The audio stream buffer  800  stores the encoded audio stream St 19  input from the audio encoder  700 , and then outputs the encoded audio stream St 19  as the time-delayed encoded audio stream St 31  based on the timing signal St 25  supplied from the encoding system controller  200 .  \\n     [0291] The system encoder  900  is connected to the video stream buffer  400 , sub-picture stream buffer  600 , audio stream buffer  800 , and the encoding system controller  200 , and is respectively supplied thereby with the time-delayed encoded video stream St 27 , time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St 29 , time-delayed encoded audio stream St 31 , and the system stream encoding parameter data St 33 . Note that the system encoder  900  is a multiplexer that multiplexes the time-delayed streams St 27 , St 29 , and St 31  based on the stream encoding data St 33  (timing signal) to generate title editing units (VOBs) St 35 .  \\n     [0292] The VOB buffer  1000  temporarily stores the video objects VOBs produced by the system encoder  900 . The formatter  1100  reads the delayed video objects VOB from the VOB buffer  1000  based on the title sequence control signal St 39  to generate one video zone VZ, and adds the volume file structure VFS to generate the edited multimedia stream data St 43 .  \\n     [0293] The multimedia bitstream MBS St 43  edited according to the user-defined scenario is then sent to the recorder  1200 . The recorder  1200  processes the edited multimedia stream data St 43  to the data stream St 45  format of the recording medium M, and thus records the formatted data stream St 45  to the recording medium M.  \\n     [0294] DVD Decoder  \\n     [0295] A preferred embodiment of a digital video disk system authoring decoder DCD in which the multimedia bitstream authoring system of the present invention is applied to a digital video disk system is described below and shown in FIG. 26. The authoring decoder DCD applied to the digital video disk system, referred to below as a DVD decoder DCD, decodes the multimedia bitstream MBS edited using the DVD encoder ECD of the present invention, and recreates the content of each title according to the user-defined scenario. It will also be obvious that the multimedia bitstream St 45  encoded by this DVD encoder ECD is recorded to a digital video disk medium M.  \\n     [0296] The basic configuration of the DVD decoder DCD according to this embodiment is the same as that of the authoring decoder DC shown in FIG. 3. The differences are that a different video decoder  3801  (shown as  3800  in FIG. 26) is used in place of the video decoder  3800 , and a reordering buffer  3300  and selector  3400  are disposed between the video decoder  3801  and synthesizer  3500 .  \\n     [0297] Note that the selector  3400  is connected to the synchronizer  2900 , and is controlled by a switching signal St 103 .  \\n     [0298] The operation of this DVD decoder DCD is therefore described below in comparison with the authoring decoder DC described above.  \\n     [0299] As shown in FIG. 26, the DVD decoder DCD comprises a multimedia bitstream producer  2000 , scenario selector  2100 , decoding system controller  2300 , stream buffer  2400 , system decoder  2500 , video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , audio buffer  2800 , synchronizer  2900 , video decoder  3801 , reordering buffer  3300 , sub-picture decoder  3100 , audio decoder  3200 , selector  3400 , synthesizer  3500 , video data output terminal  3600 , and audio data output terminal  3700 .  \\n     [0300] The bitstream producer  2000  comprises a recording media drive unit  2004  for driving the recording medium M; a reading head  2006  for reading the information recorded to the recording medium M and producing the binary read signal St 57 ; a signal processor  2008  for variously processing the read signal St 57  to generate the reproduced bitstream St 61 ; and a reproduction controller  2002 .  \\n     [0301] The reproduction controller  2002  is connected to the decoding system controller  2300  from which the multimedia bitstream reproduction control signal St 53  is supplied, and in turn generates the reproduction control signals St 55  and St 59  respectively controlling the recording media drive unit (motor)  2004  and signal processor  2008 .  \\n     [0302] So that the user-defined video, sub-picture, and audio portions of the multimedia title edited by the authoring encoder EC are reproduced, the authoring decoder DC comprises a scenario selector  2100  for selecting and reproducing the corresponding scenes (titles). The scenario selector  2100  then outputs the selected titles as scenario data to the DVD decoder DCD.  \\n     [0303] The scenario selector  2100  preferably comprises a keyboard, CPU, and monitor. Using the keyboard, the user then inputs the desired scenario based on the content of the scenario input by the DVD encoder ECD. Based on the keyboard input, the CPU generates the scenario selection data St 51  specifying the selected scenario. The scenario selector  2100  is connected to the decoding system controller  2300  by an infrared communications device, for example, and inputs the generated scenario selection data St 51  to the decoding system controller  2300 .  \\n     [0304] The stream buffer  2400  has a specific buffer capacity used to temporarily store the reproduced bitstream St 61  input from the bitstream producer  2000 , extract the volume file structure VFS, the initial synchronization data SCR (system clock reference) in each pack, and the VOBU control information (DSI) in the navigation pack NV, to generate the bitstream control data St 63 . The stream buffer  2400  is also connected to the decoding system controller  2300 , to which it supplies the generated bitstream control data St 63 .  \\n     [0305] Based on the scenario selection data St 51  supplied by the scenario selector  2100 , the decoding system controller  2300  then generates the bitstream reproduction control signal St 53  controlling the operation of the bitstream producer  2000 . The decoding system controller  2300  also extracts the user-defined playback instruction data from the bitstream reproduction control signal St 53 , and generates the decoding information table required for decoding control. This decoding information table is described further below with reference to FIGS. 26 and 32. The decoding system controller  2300  also extracts the title information recorded to the optical disk M from the file data structure area FDS of the bitstream control data St 63  to generate the title information signal St 200 . Note that the extracted title information includes the video manager VMG, VTS information VTSI, the PGC information entries C_PBI #j, and the cell presentation time C_PBTM.  \\n     [0306] Note that the bitstream control data St 63  is generated in pack units as shown in FIG. 19, and is supplied from the stream buffer  2400  to the decoding system controller  2300 , to which the stream buffer  2400  is connected.  \\n     [0307] The synchronizer  2900  is connected to the decoding system controller  2300  from which it receives the system clock reference SCR contained in the synchronization control data St 81  to set the internal system clock STC and supply the reset system clock St 79  to the decoding system controller  2300 .  \\n     [0308] Based on this system clock St 79 , the decoding system controller  2300  also generates the stream read signal St 65  at a specific interval and outputs the read signal St 65  to the stream buffer  2400 . Note that the read unit in this case is the pack.  \\n     [0309] The method of generating the stream read signal St 65  is described next.  \\n     [0310] The decoding system controller  2300  compares the system clock reference SCR contained in the stream control data extracted from the stream buffer  2400  with the system clock St 79  supplied from the synchronizer  2900 , and generates the read request signal St 65  when the system clock St 79  is greater than the system clock reference SCR of the bitstream control data St 63 . Pack transfers are controlled by executing this control process on a pack unit.  \\n     [0311] Based on the scenario selection data St 51 , the decoding system controller  2300  generates the decoding signal St 69  defining the stream Ids for the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams corresponding to the selected scenario, and outputs to the system decoder  2500 .  \\n     [0312] When a title contains plural audio tracks, e.g. audio tracks in Japanese, English, French, and/or other languages, and plural sub-picture tracks for subtitles in Japanese, English, French, and/or other languages, for example, a discrete ID is assigned to each of the language tracks. As described above with reference to FIG. 19, a stream ID is assigned to the video data and MPEG audio data, and a substream ID is assigned to the sub-picture data, AC-3 audio data, linear PCM data, and navigation pack NV information. While the user need never be aware of these ID numbers, the user can select the language of the audio and/or subtitles using the scenario selector  2100 . If English language audio is selected, for example, the ID corresponding to the English audio track is sent to the decoding system controller  2300  as scenario selection data St 51 . The decoding system controller  2300  then adds this ID to the decoding signal St 69  output to the system decoder  2500 .  \\n     [0313] Based on the instructions contained in the decoding signal St 69 , the system decoder  2500  respectively outputs the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams input from the stream buffer  2400  to the video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , and audio buffer  2800  as the encoded video stream St 71 , encoded sub-picture stream St 73 , and encoded audio stream St 75 . Thus, when the stream ID input from the scenario selector  2100  and the pack ID input from the stream buffer  2400  match, the system decoder  2500  outputs the corresponding packs to the respective buffers (i.e., the video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , and audio buffer  2800 ).  \\n     [0314] The system decoder  2500  detects the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS of the smallest control unit in each bitstream St 67  to generate the time information signal St 77 . This time information signal St 77  is supplied to the synchronizer  2900  through the decoding system controller  2300  as the synchronization control data St 81 . Based on this synchronization control data St 81 , the synchronizer  2900  determines the decoding start timing whereby each of the bitstreams will be arranged in the correct sequence after decoding, and then generates and inputs the video stream decoding start signal St 89  to the video decoder  3801  based on this decoding timing. The synchronizer  2900  also generates and supplies the sub-picture decoding start signal St 91  and audio stream decoding start signal St 93  to the sub-picture decoder  3100  and audio decoder  3200 , respectively.  \\n     [0315] The video decoder  3801  generates the video output request signal St 84  based on the video stream decoding start signal St 89 , and outputs to the video buffer  2600 . In response to the video output request signal St 84 , the video buffer  2600  outputs the video stream St 83  to the video decoder  3801 . The video decoder  3801  thus detects the presentation time information contained in the video stream St 83 , and disables the video output request signal St 84  when the length of the received video stream St 83  is equivalent to the specified presentation time. A video stream equal in length to the specified presentation time is thus decoded by the video decoder  3801 , which outputs the reproduced video signal St 95  to the reordering buffer  3300  and selector  3400 .  \\n     [0316] Because the encoded video stream is coded using the interframe correlations between pictures, the coded order and display order do not necessarily match on a frame unit basis. The video cannot, therefore, be displayed in the decoded order. The decoded frames are therefore temporarily stored to the reordering buffer  3300 . The synchronizer  2900  therefore controls the switching signal St 103  so that the reproduced video signal St 95  output from the video decoder  3800  and the reordering buffer output St 97  are appropriately selected and output in the display order to the synthesizer  3500 .  \\n     [0317] The sub-picture decoder  3100  similarly generates the sub-picture output request signal St 86  based on the sub-picture decoding start signal St 91 , and outputs to the sub-picture buffer  2700 . In response to the sub-picture output request signal St 86 , the sub-picture buffer  2700  outputs the sub-picture stream St 85  to the sub-picture decoder  3100 . Based on the presentation time information contained in the sub-picture stream St 85 , the sub-picture decoder  3100  decodes a length of the sub-picture stream St 85  corresponding to the specified presentation time to reproduce and supply to the synthesizer  3500  the sub-picture signal St 99 .  \\n     [0318] The synthesizer  3500  superimposes the selector  3400  output with the sub-picture signal St 99  to generate and output the video signal St 105  to the video data output terminal  3600 .  \\n     [0319] The audio decoder  3200  generates and supplies to the audio buffer  2800  the audio output request signal St 88  based on the audio stream decoding start signal St 93 . The audio buffer  2800  thus outputs the audio stream St 87  to the audio decoder  3200 . The audio decoder  3200  decodes a length of the audio stream St 87  corresponding to the specified presentation time based on the presentation time information contained in the audio stream St 87 , and outputs the decoded audio stream St 101  to the audio data output terminal  3700 .  \\n     [0320] It is thus possible to reproduce a user-defined multimedia bitstream MBS in real-time according to a user-defined scenario. More specifically, each time the user selects a different scenario, the DVD decoder DCD is able to reproduce the title content desired by the user in the desired sequence by reproducing the multimedia bitstream MBS corresponding to the selected scenario.  \\n     [0321] It should be noted that the decoding system controller  2300  may supply the title information signal St 200  to the scenario selector  2100  by means of the infrared communications device mentioned above or another means. Interactive scenario selection controlled by the user can also be made possible by the scenario selector  2100  extracting the title information recorded to the optical disk M from the file data structure area FDS of the bitstream control data St 63  contained in the title information signal St 200 , and displaying this title information on a display for user selection.  \\n     [0322] Note, further, that the stream buffer  2400 , video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , audio buffer  2800 , and reordering buffer  3300  are expressed above and in the figures as separate entities because they are functionally different. It will be obvious, however, that a single buffer memory can be controlled to provide the same discrete functionality by time-share controlled use of a buffer memory with an operating speed plural times faster than the read and write rates of these separate buffers.  \\n     [0323] Multi-scene Control  \\n     [0324] The concept of multiple angle scene control according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 21. As described above, titles that can be played back with numerous variations are constructed from basic scene periods containing data common to each title, and multi-scene periods comprising groups of different scenes corresponding to the various scenario requests. In FIG. 21, scenes  1 ,  5 , and  8  are the common scenes of the basic scene.-periods. The multi-angle scenes (angles  1 ,  2 , and  3 ) between scenes  1  and  5 , and the parental locked scenes (scenes  6  and  7 ) between scenes  5  and  8 , are the multi-scene periods.  \\n     [0325] Scenes taken from different angles, i.e., angles  1 ,  2 , and  3  in this example, can be dynamically selected and reproduced during playback in the multi-angle scene period. In the parental locked scene period, however, only one of the available scenes, scenes  6  and  7 , having different content can be selected, and must be selected statically before playback begins.  \\n     [0326] Which of these scenes from the multi-scene periods is to be selected and reproduced is defined by the user operating the scenario selector  2100  and thereby generating the scenario selection data St 51 . In scenario  1  in FIG. 21 the user can freely select any of the multi-angle scenes, and scene  6  has been preselected for output in the parental locked scene period. Similarly in scenario  2 , the user can freely select any of the multi-angle scenes, and scene  7  has been preselected for output in the parental locked scene period.  \\n     [0327] With reference to FIGS. 30 and 31, furthermore, the contents of the program chain information VTS_PGCI is described. In FIG. 30, the case that a scenario requested by the user is shown with respect to a VTSI data construction. The scenario  1  and scenario  2  shown in FIG. 21 are described as program chain information VTS_PGC# 1  and VTS_PGC# 2 . VTS_PGC# 1  describing the scenario  1  consists of cell playback information C_PBI# 1  corresponding to scene  1 , C_PBI# 2 , C_PBI# 3 , and C_PBI# 4  within a multi-angle cell block, C_PBI# 5  corresponding to scene  5 , C_PBI# 6  corresponding to scene  6 , and C_PBI# 7  corresponding to scene  8 .  \\n     [0328] VTS_PGCI# 2  describing the scenario  2  consists of cell playback information C_PBI# 1  corresponding to scene  1 , C_PBI# 2 , C_PBI# 3 , and C_PBI# 4  within a multi-angle cell block corresponding to a multi-angle scene, C_PBI# 5  corresponding to scene  5 , C_PBI# 6  corresponding to scene  7 , and C_PBI# 7  corresponding to scene  8 . According to the digital video system data structure, a scene which is a control unit of a scenario is described as a cell which is a unit thereunder, thus a scenario requested by a user can be obtained.  \\n     [0329] In FIG. 31, the case that a scenario requested by the user shown in FIG. 21 is shown with respect to a VOB data construction VTSTT_VOBS. As specifically shown in FIG. 31, the two scenarios  1  and  2  use the same VOB data in common. With respect to a single scene commonly owned by each scenario, VOB# 1  corresponding to scene  1 , VOB# 5  corresponding to scene  5 , and VOB# 8  corresponding to scene  8  are arranged in non-interleaved block which is the contiguous block.  \\n     [0330] With respect to the multi-angle data commonly owned by scenarios  1  and  2 , one angle scene data is constructed by a single VOB. Specifically speaking, angle  1  is constructed by VOB# 2 , and angle  2  is constructed by VOB# 3 , angle  3  is constructed by VOB# 4 . Thus constructed multi-angle data is formed as the interleaved block for the sake of switching between each angle and seamless reproduction of each angle data. Scenes  6  and  7  peculiar to scenarios  1  and  2 , respectively, are formed as the interleaved block for the sake of seamless reproduction between common scenes before and behind thereof as well as seamless reproduction between each scene.  \\n     [0331] As described in the above, the user&#39;s requesting scenario shown in FIG. 21 can be realized by utilizing the video title playback control information shown in FIG. 30 and the title playback VOB data structure shown in FIG. 31.  \\n     [0332] Seamless Playback  \\n     [0333] The seamless playback capability briefly mentioned above with regard to the digital video disk system data structure is described below. Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information between basic scene periods, between basic scene periods and multi-scene periods, and between multi-scene periods.  \\n     [0334] Hardware factors contributing to intermittent playback of this data and title content include decoder underflow, i.e., an imbalance between the source data input speed and the decoding speed of the input source data.  \\n     [0335] Other factors relate to the properties of the playback data. When the playback data is data that must be continuously reproduced for a constant time unit in order for the user to understand the content or information, e.g., audio data, data continuity is lost when the required continuous presentation time cannot be assured. Reproduction of such information whereby the required continuity is assured is referred to as \u201ccontiguous information reproduction,\u201d or \u201cseamless information reproduction.\u201d Reproduction of this information when the required continuity cannot be assured is referred to as \u201cnon-continuous information reproduction,\u201d or \u201cnon-seamless information reproduction.\u201d It is obvious that continuous information reproduction and non-continuous information reproduction are, respectively, seamless and non-seamless reproduction.  \\n     [0336] Note that seamless reproduction can be further categorized as seamless data reproduction and seamless information reproduction. Seamless data reproduction is defined as preventing physical blanks or interruptions in the data playback (intermittent reproduction) as a result of a buffer underflow state, for example. Seamless information reproduction is defined as preventing apparent interruptions in the information when perceived by the user (intermittent presentation) when recognizing information from the playback data where there are no actual physical breaks in the data reproduction. The specific method enabling seamless reproduction as thus described is described later below with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24.  \\n     [0337] Interleaving  \\n     [0338] The DVD data system streams described above are recorded using an appropriate authoring encoder EC as a movie or other multimedia title on a DVD recording medium. Note that the following description refers to a movie as the multimedia title being processed, but it will be obvious that the invention shall not be so limited.  \\n     [0339] Supplying a single movie in a format enabling the movie to be used in plural different cultural regions or countries requires the script to be recorded in the various languages used in those regions or countries. It may even necessitate editing the content to conform to the mores and moral expectations of different cultures. Even using such a large-capacity storage system as the DVD system, however, it is necessary to reduce the bit rate, and therefore the image quality, if plural full-length titles edited from a single common source title are recorded to a single disk. This problem can be solved by recording the common parts of plural titles only once, and recording the segments different in each title for each different title only. This method makes it possible to record plural titles for different countries or cultures to a single optical disk without reducing the bit rate, and, therefore, retaining high image quality.  \\n     [0340] As shown in FIG. 21, the titles recorded to a single optical disk contain basic scene periods of scenes common to all scenarios, and multi-scene periods containing scenes specific to certain scenarios, to provide parental lock control and multi-angle scene control functions.  \\n     [0341] In the case of the parental lock control function, titles containing sex scenes, violent scenes, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children, i.e., so-called \u201cadult scenes,\u201d are recorded with a combination of common scenes, adult scenes, and children&#39;s scenes. These title streams are achieved by arraying the adult and children&#39;s scenes to multi-scene periods between the common basic scene periods.  \\n     [0342] Multi-angle control can be achieved in a conventional single-angle title by recording plural multimedia scenes obtained by recording the subjects from the desired plural camera angles to the multi-scene periods arrayed between the common basic scene periods. Note, however, that while these plural scenes are described here as scenes recorded from different camera angles (positions), it will be obvious that the scenes may be recorded from the same camera angle but at different times, data generated by computer graphics, or other video data.  \\n     [0343] When data is shared between different scenarios of a single title, it is obviously necessary to move the laser beam LS from the common scene data to the non-common scene data during reproduction, i.e., to move the optical pickup to a different position on the DVD recording medium RC 1 . The problem here is that the time required to move the optical pickup makes it difficult to continue reproduction without creating breaks in the audio or video, i.e., to sustain seamless reproduction. This problem can be theoretically solved by providing a track buffer (stream buffer  2400 ) to delay data output an amount equivalent to the worst access time. In general, data recorded to an optical disk is read by the optical pickup, appropriately processed, and temporarily stored to the track buffer. The stored data is subsequently-decoded and reproduced as video or audio data.  \\n     [0344] To thus enable the user to selectively excise scenes and choose from among plural scenes, a state wherein non-selected scene data is recorded inserted between common scene data and selective scene data necessarily occurs because the data units associated with individual scenes are contiguously recorded to the recording tracks of the recording medium. If data is then read in the recorded sequence, non-selected scene data must be accessed before accessing and decoding the selected scene data, and seamless connections with the selected scene is difficult. The excellent random access characteristics of the digital video disk system, however, make seamless connections with the selected scenes possible.  \\n     [0345] In other words, by splitting scene-specific data into plural units of a specified data size, and interleaving plural split data units for different scenes in a predefined sequence that is recorded to disk within the jumping range whereby an data underflow state does not occur, it is possible to reproduce the selected scenes without data interruptions by intermittently accessing and decoding the data specific to the selected scenes using these split data units. Seamless data reproduction is thereby assured.  \\n     [0346] Interleaved Block and Interleave Unit  \\n     [0347] The interleaving method enabling seamless data reproduction according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 24. and FIG. 71. Shown in FIG. 24 is a case from which three scenarios may be derived, i.e., branching from one video object VOB-A to one of plural video objects VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D, and then merging back again to a single video object VOB-E. The actual arrangement of these blocks recorded to a data recording track TR on disk is shown in FIG. 71.  \\n     [0348] Referring to FIG. 71, VOB-A and VOB-E are video objects with independent playback start and end times, and are in principle arrayed to contiguous block regions. As shown in FIG. 24, the playback start and end times of VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D are aligned during interleaving. The interleaved data blocks are then recorded to disk to a contiguous interleaved block region. The contiguous block regions and interleaved block regions are then written to disk in the track path Dr direction in the playback sequence. Plural video objects VOB, i.e., interleaved video objects VOBS, arrayed to the data recording track TR are shown in FIG. 37.  \\n     [0349] Referring to FIG. 37, data regions to which data is continuously arrayed are called \u201cblocks,\u201d of which there are two types: \u201ccontiguous block regions\u201d in which VOB with discrete starting and end points are contiguously arrayed, and \u201cinterleaved block regions\u201d in which plural VOB with aligned starting and end points are interleaved. The respective blocks are arrayed as shown in FIG. 38 in the playback sequence, i.e., block  1 , block  2 , block  3 , . . . block  7 .  \\n     [0350] As shown in FIG. 73, the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) consist of blocks  1 - 7 , inclusive. Block  1  contains VOB  1  alone. Blocks  2 ,  3 ,  5 , and  7  similarly discretely contain VOBS  2 ,  3 ,  6 , and  10 . Blocks  2 ,  3 ,  5 , and  7  are thus contiguous block regions.  \\n     [0351] Block  4 , however, contains VOB  4  and VOB  5  interleaved together, while block  6  contains VOB  7 , VOB  8 , and VOB  9  interleaved together. Blocks  4  and  6  are thus interleaved block regions.  \\n     [0352] The internal data structure of the contiguous block regions is shown in FIG. 73 with VOB-i and VOB-j arrayed as the contiguous blocks in the VOBs. As described with reference to FIG. 16, VOB-i and VOB-j inside the contiguous block regions are further logically divided into cells as the playback unit. Both VOB-i and VOB-j in this figure are shown comprising three cells CELL # 1 , CELL # 2 , and CELL # 3 .  \\n     [0353] Each cell comprises one or more video object unit VOBU with the video object unit VOBU defining the boundaries of the cell. Each cell also contains information identifying the position of the cell in the program chain PGC (the playback control information of the digital video disk system). More specifically, this position information is the address of the first and last VOBU in the cell. As also shown in FIG. 73, these VOB and the cells defined therein are also recorded to a contiguous block region so that contiguous blocks are contiguously reproduced. Reproducing these contiguous blocks is therefore no problem.  \\n     [0354] The internal data structure of the interleaved block regions is shown in FIG. 74. In the interleaved block regions each video object VOB is divided into interleaved units ILVU, and the interleaved units ILVU associated with each VOB are alternately arrayed. Cell boundaries are defined independently of the interleaved units ILVU. For example, VOB-k is divided into four interleaved units ILVUk 1 , ILVUk 2 , ILVUk 3 , and ILVUk 4 , and are confined by a single cell CELL#k. VOB-k is likewise divided into four interleaved units ILVUm 1 , ILVUm 2 , ILVUm 3 , and ILVUm 4 , and is confined by a sincle cell CELL#m. Note that instead of a single cell CELL#k or CELL#m, each of VOB-k and VOB-m can be divided into more than two cells. The interleaved units ILVU thus contains both audio and video data.  \\n     [0355] In the example shown in FIG. 74, the interleaved units ILVUk 1 , ILVUk 2 , ILVUk 3 , and ILVUk 4 , and ILVUm 1 , ILVUm 2 , ILVUm 3 , and ILVUm 4 , from two different video objects VOB-k and VOB-m are alternately arrayed within a single interleaved block. By interleaving the interleaved units ILVU of two video objects VOB in this sequence, it is possible to achieve seamless reproduction branching from one scene to one of plural scenes, and from one of plural scenes to one scene.  \\n     [0356] Multi-scene Control  \\n     [0357] The multi-scene period is described together with the concept of multi-scene control according to the present invention using by way of example a title comprising scenes recorded from different angles.  \\n     [0358] Each scene in multi-scene control is recorded from the same angle, but may be recorded at different times or may even be computer graphics data. The multi-angle scene periods may therefore also be called multi-scene periods.  \\n     [0359] Parental Control  \\n     [0360] The concept of recording plural titles comprising alternative scenes for such functions as parental lock control and recording director&#39;s cuts is described below using FIG. 15.  \\n     [0361] An example of a multi-rated title stream providing for parental lock control is shown in FIG. 15. When so-called \u201cadult scenes\u201d containing sex, violence, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children are contained in a title implementing parental lock control, the title stream is recorded with a combination of common system streams SSa, SSb, and Sse, an adult-oriented system stream SSc containing the adult scenes, and a child-oriented system stream SSd containing only the scenes suitable for children. Title streams such as this are recorded as a multi-scene system stream containing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and the child-oriented system stream Ssd arrayed to the multi-scene period between common system streams Ssb and Sse.  \\n     [0362] The relationship between each of the component titles and the system stream recorded to the program chain PGC of a title stream thus comprised is described below.  \\n     [0363] The adult-oriented title program chain PGC 1  comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and the common system stream Sse. The child-oriented title program chain PGC 2  comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the child-oriented system stream Ssd, and the common system stream Sse.  \\n     [0364] By thus arraying the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and child-oriented system stream Ssd to a multi-scene period, the decoding method previously described can reproduce the title containing adult-oriented content by reproducing the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, then selecting and reproducing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc, and then reproducing the common system stream Sse as instructed by the adult-oriented title program chain PGC 1 . By alternatively following the child-oriented title program chain PGC 2  and selecting the child-oriented system stream Ssd in the multi-scene period, a child-oriented title from which the adult-oriented scenes have been expurgated can be reproduced.  \\n     [0365] This method of providing in the title stream a multi-scene period containing plural alternative scenes, selecting which of the scenes in the multi-scene period are to be reproduced before playback begins, and generating plural titles containing essentially the same title content but different scenes in part, is called parental lock control.  \\n     [0366] Note that parental lock control is so named because of the perceived need to protect children from undesirable content. From the perspective of system stream processing, however, parental lock control is a technology for statically generating different title streams by means of the user pre-selecting specific scenes from a multi-scene period. Note, further, that this contrasts with multi-angle scene control, which is a technology for dynamically changing the content of a single title by means of the user selecting scenes from the multi-scene period freely and in real-time during title playback.  \\n     [0367] This parental lock control technology can also be used to enable title stream editing such as when making the director&#39;s cut. The director&#39;s cut refers to the process of editing certain scenes from a movie to, for example, shorten the total presentation time. This may be necessary, for example, to edit a feature-length movie for viewing on an airplane where the presentation time is too long for viewing within the flight time or certain content may not be acceptable. The movie director thus determines which scenes may be cut to shorten the movie. The title can then be recorded with both a full-length, unedited system stream and an edited system stream in which the edited scenes are recorded to multi-scene periods. At the transition from one system stream to another system stream in such applications, parental lock control must be able to maintain smooth playback image output. More specifically, seamless data reproduction whereby a data underflow state does not occur in the audio, video, or other buffers, and seamless information reproduction whereby no unnatural interruptions are audibly or visibly perceived in the audio and video playback, are necessary.  \\n     [0368] Multi-angle Control  \\n     [0369] The concept of multi-angle scene control in the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 33. In general, multimedia titles are obtained by recording both the audio and video information (collectively \u201crecording\u201d below) of the subject over time T. The angled scene blocks #SC 1 , #SM 1 , #SM 2 , #SM 3 , and #SC 3  represent the multimedia scenes obtained at recording unit times T 1 , T 2 , and T 3  by recording the subject at respective camera angles. Scenes #SM 1 , #SM 2 , and #SM 3  are recorded at mutually different (first, second, and third) camera angles during recording unit time T 2 , and are referenced below as the first, second, and third angled scenes.  \\n     [0370] Note that the multi-scene periods referenced herein are basically assumed to comprise scenes recorded from different angles. The scenes may, however, be recorded from the same angle but at different times, or they may be computer graphics data. The multi-angle scene periods are thus the multi-scene periods from which plural scenes can be selected for presentation in the same time period, whether or not the scenes are actually recorded at different camera angles.  \\n     [0371] Scenes #SC 1  and #SC 3  are scenes recorded at the same common camera angle during recording unit times T 1  and T 3 , i.e., before and after the multi-angle scenes. These scenes are therefore called \u201ccommon angle scenes.\u201d Note that one of the multiple camera angles used in the multi-angle scenes is usually the same as the common camera angle.  \\n     [0372] To understand the relationship between these various angled scenes, multi-angle scene control is described below using a live broadcast of a baseball game for example only.  \\n     [0373] The common angle scenes #SC 1  and #SC 3  are recorded at the common camera angle, which is here defined as the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher.  \\n     [0374] The first angled scene #SM 1  is recorded at the first multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop on the axis through the catcher, pitcher, and batter. The second angled scene #SM 2  is recorded at the second multi-camera angle, i.e., the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher. Note that the second angled scene #SM 2  is thus the same as the common camera angle in this example. It therefore follows that the second angled scene #SM 2  is the same as the common angle scene #SC 2  recorded during recording unit time T 2 . The third angled scene #SM 3  is recorded at the third multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop focusing on the infield.  \\n     [0375] The presentation times of the multiple angle scenes #SM 1 , #SM 2 , and #SM 3  overlap in recording unit time T 2 ; this period is called the \u201cmulti-angle scene period.\u201d By freely selecting one of the multiple angle scenes #SM 1 , #SM 2 , and #SM 3  in this multi-angle scene period, the viewer is able to change his or her virtual viewing position to enjoy a different view of the game as though the actual camera angle is changed. Note that while there appears to be a time gap between common angle scenes #SC 1  and #SC 3  and the multiple angle scenes #SM 1 , #SM 2 , and #SM 3  in FIG. 33, this is simply to facilitate the use of arrows in the figure for easier description of the data reproduction paths reproduced by selecting different angled scenes. There is no actual time gap during playback.  \\n     [0376] Multi-angle scene control of the system stream based on the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 23 from the perspective of connecting data blocks. The multimedia data corresponding to common angle scene #SC is referenced as common angle data BA, and the common angle data BA in recording unit times T 1  and T 3  are referenced as BA 1  and BA 3 , respectively. The multimedia data corresponding to the multiple angle scenes #SM 1 , #SM 2 , and #SM 3  are referenced as first, second, and third angle scene data MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3 . As previously described with reference to FIG. 33, scenes from the desired angled can be viewed by selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3 . There is also no time gap between the common angle data BA 1  and BA 3  and the multiple angle data units MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3 .  \\n     [0377] In the case of an MPEG system stream, however, intermittent breaks in the playback information can result between the reproduced common and multiple angle data units depending upon the content of the data at the connection between the selected multiple angle data unit MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3  and the common angle data BA (either the first common angle data BA 1  before the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period or the common angle data BA 3  following the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period). The result in this case is that the title stream is not naturally reproduced as a single contiguous title, i.e., seamless data reproduction is achieved but non-seamless information reproduction results.  \\n     [0378] The multi-angle selection process whereby one of plural scenes is selectively reproduced from the multi-angle scene period with seamless information presentation to the scenes before and after is described below with application in a digital video disk system using FIG. 23.  \\n     [0379] Changing the scene angle, i.e., selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3 , must be completed before reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA 1  is completed. It is extremely difficult, for example, to change to a different angle data unit MA 2  during reproduction of common angle data BA 1 . This is because the multimedia data has a variable length coded MPEG data structure, which makes it difficult to find the data break points (boundaries) in the selected data blocks. The video may also be disrupted when the angle is changed because inter-frame correlations are used in the coding process. The group_of_pictures GOP processing unit of the MPEG standard contains at least one refresh frame, and closed processing not referencing frames belonging to another GOP is possible within this GOP processing unit.  \\n     [0380] In other words, if the desired angle data, e. g., MA 3 , is selected before reproduction reaches the multi-angle scene period, and at the latest by the time reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA 1  is completed, the angle data selected from within the multi-angle scene period can be seamlessly reproduced. However, it is extremely difficult while reproducing one angle to select and seamlessly reproduce another angle within the same multi-angle scene period. It is therefore difficult when in a multi-angle scene period to dynamically select a different angle unit presenting, for example, a view from a different camera angle.  \\n     [0381] Flow Chart: Encoder  \\n     [0382] The encoding information table generated by the encoding system controller  200  from information extracted from the scenario data St 7  is described below referring to FIG. 27.  \\n     [0383] The encoding information table contains VOB set data streams containing plural VOB corresponding to the scene periods beginning and ending at the scene branching and connecting points, and VOB data streams corresponding to each scene. These VOB set data streams shown in FIG. 27 are the encoding information tables generated at step # 100  in FIG. 34 by the encoding system controller  200  for creating the DVD multimedia stream based on the user-defined title content.  \\n     [0384] The user-defined scenario contains branching points from common scenes to plural scenes, or connection points to other common scenes. The VOB corresponding to the scene period delimited by these branching and connecting points is a VOB set, and the data generated to encode a VOB set is the VOB set data stream. The title number specified by the VOB set data stream is the title number TITLE_NO of the VOB set data stream.  \\n     [0385] The VOB Set data structure in FIG. 27 shows the data content for encoding one VOB set in the VOB set data stream, and comprises: the VOB set number VOBS_NO, the VOB number VOB_NO in the VOB set, the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb, the following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf, the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp, the interleave flag VOB_Fi, the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm, the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV, the maximum bit rate of the interleaved VOB ILV_BR, the number of interleaved VOB divisions ILV_DIV, and the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT.  \\n     [0386] The VOB set number VOBS_NO is a sequential number identifying the VOB set and the position of the VOB set in the reproduction sequence of the title scenario.  \\n     [0387] The VOB number VOB_NO is a sequential number identifying the VOB and the position of the VOB in the reproduction sequence of the title scenario.  \\n     [0388] The preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb indicates whether a seamless connection with the preceding VOB is required for scenario reproduction.  \\n     [0389] The following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf indicates whether there is a seamless connection with the following VOB during scenario reproduction.  \\n     [0390] The multi-scene flag VOB_Fp identifies whether the VOB set comprises plural video objects VOB.  \\n     [0391] The interleave flag VOB_Fi identifies whether the VOB in the VOB set are interleaved.  \\n     [0392] The multi-angle flag VOB_Fm identifies whether the VOB set is a multi-angle set.  \\n     [0393] The multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV identifies whether angle changes within the multi-angle scene period are seamless or not.  \\n     [0394] The maximum bit rate of the interleaved VOB ILV_BR defines the maximum bit rate of the interleaved VOBs.  \\n     [0395] The number of interleaved VOB divisions ILV_DIV identifies the number of interleave units in the interleaved VOB.  \\n     [0396] The minimum interleave unit presentation time ILVU_MT defines the time that can be reproduced when the bit rate of the smallest interleave unit at which a track buffer data underflow state does not occur is the maximum bit rate of the interleaved VOB_ILV BR during interleaved block reproduction.  \\n     [0397] The encoding information table for each VOB generated by the encoding system controller  200  based on the scenario data St 7  is described below referring to FIG. 28. The VOB encoding parameters described below and supplied to the video encoder  300 , audio encoder  700 , and system encoder  900  for stream encoding are produced based on this encoding information table.  \\n     [0398] The VOB data streams shown in FIG. 28 are the encoding information tables generated at step # 100  in FIG. 34 by the encoding system controller  200  for creating the DVD multimedia stream based on the user-defined title content.  \\n     [0399] The encoding unit is the video object VOB, and the data generated to encode each video object VOB is the VOB data stream. For example, a VOB set comprising three angle scenes comprises three video objects VOB. The data structure shown in FIG. 28 shows the content of the data for encoding one VOB in the VOB data stream.  \\n     [0400] The VOB data structure contains the video material start time VOB_VST, the video material end time VOB_VEND, the video signal type VOB_V_KIND, the video encoding bit rate V_BR, the audio material start time VOB_AST, the audio material end time VOB_AEND, the audio coding method VOB_A_KIND, and the audio encoding bit rate A_BR.  \\n     [0401] The video material start time VOB_VST is the video encoding start time corresponding to the time of the video signal.  \\n     [0402] The video material end time VOB_VEND is the video encoding end time corresponding to the time of the video signal.  \\n     [0403] The video material type VOB_V_KIND identifies whether the encoded material is in the NTSC or PAL format, for example, or is photographic material (a movie, for example) converted to a television broadcast format (so-called telecine conversion).  \\n     [0404] The video encoding bit rate V_BR is the bit rate at which the video signal is encoded.  \\n     [0405] The audio material start time VOB_AST is the audio encoding start time corresponding to the time of the audio signal.  \\n     [0406] The audio material end time VOB_AEND is the audio encoding end time corresponding to the time of the audio signal.  \\n     [0407] The audio coding method VOB_A_KIND identifies the audio encoding method as AC-3, MPEG, or linear PCM, for example.  \\n     [0408] The audio encoding bit rate A_BR is the bit rate at which the audio signal is encoded.  \\n     [0409] The encoding parameters used by the video encoder  300 , sub-picture encoder  500 , and audio encoder  700 , and system encoder  900  for VOB encoding are shown in FIG. 29. The encoding parameters include: the VOB number VOB_NO, video encode start time V_STTM, video encode end time V_ENDTM, the video encode mode V_ENCMD, the video encode bit rate V_RATE, the maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE, the GOP structure fixing flag GOP_Fxflag, the video encode GOP structure GOPST, the initial video encode data V_INTST, the last video encode data V_ENDST, the audio encode start time A_STTM, the audio encode end time A_ENDTM, the audio encode bit rate A_RATE, the audio encode method A_ENCMD, the audio start gap A_STGAP, the audio end gap A_ENDGAP, the preceding VOB number B_VOB_NO, and the following VOB number F VOB NO.  \\n     [0410] The VOB number VOB_NO is a sequential number identifying the VOB and the position of the VOB in the reproduction sequence of the title scenario.  \\n     [0411] The video encode start time V_STTM is the start time of video material encoding.  \\n     [0412] The video encode end time V_ENDTM is the end time of video material encoding.  \\n     [0413] The video encode mode V_ENCMD is an encoding mode for declaring whether reverse telecine conversion shall be accomplished during video encoding to enable efficient coding when the video material is telecine converted material.  \\n     [0414] The video encode bit rate V_RATE is the average bit rate of video encoding.  \\n     [0415] The maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE is the maximum bit rate of video encoding.  \\n     [0416] The GOP structure fixing flag GOP_Fxflag specifies whether encoding is accomplished without changing the GOP structure in the middle of the video encoding process. This is a useful parameter for declaring whether seamless switch is enabled in a multi-angle scene period.  \\n     [0417] The video encode GOP structure GOPST is the GOP structure data from encoding.  \\n     [0418] The initial video encode data V_INTST sets the initial value of the VBV buffer (decoder buffer) at the start of video encoding, and is referenced during video decoding to initialize the decoding buffer. This is a useful parameter for declaring seamless reproduction with the preceding encoded video stream.  \\n     [0419] The last video encode data V_ENDST sets the end value of the VBV buffer (decoder buffer) at the end of video encoding, and is referenced during video decoding to initialize the decoding buffer. This is a useful parameter for declaring seamless reproduction with the preceding encoded video stream.  \\n     [0420] The audio encode start time A_STTM is the start time of audio material encoding.  \\n     [0421] The audio encode end time A_ENDTM is the end time of audio material encoding. The audio encode bit rate A_RATE is the bit rate used for audio encoding.  \\n     [0422] The audio encode method A_ENCMD identifies the audio encoding method as AC-3, MPEG, or linear PCM, for example.  \\n     [0423] The audio start gap A_STGAP is the time offset between the start of the audio and video presentation at the beginning of a VOB. This is a useful parameter for declaring seamless reproduction with the preceding encoded system stream.  \\n     [0424] The audio end gap A_ENDGAP is the time offset between the end of the audio and video presentation at the end of a VOB. This is a useful parameter for declaring seamless reproduction with the preceding encoded system stream.  \\n     [0425] The preceding VOB number B_VOB_NO is the VOB_NO of the preceding VOB when there is a seamlessly connected preceding VOB.  \\n     [0426] The following VOB number F_VOB_NO is the VOB_NO of the following VOB when there is a seamlessly connected following VOB.  \\n     [0427] The operation of a DVD encoder ECD according to the present invention is described below with reference to the flow chart in FIG. 34. Note that the steps shown with a double line are subroutines. It should be obvious that while the operation described below relates specifically in this case to the DVD encoder ECD of the present invention, the operation described also applies to an authoring encoder EC.  \\n     [0428] At step # 100 , the user inputs the editing commands according to the user-defined scenario while confirming the content of the multimedia source data streams St 1 , St 2 , and St 3 .  \\n     [0429] At step # 200 , the scenario editor  100  generates the scenario data St 7  containing the above edit command information according to the user&#39;s editing instructions.  \\n     [0430] When generating the scenario data St 7  in step # 200 , the user editing commands related to multi-angle and parental lock multi-scene periods in which interleaving is presumed must be input to satisfy the following conditions.  \\n     [0431] First, the VOB maximum bit rate must be set to assure sufficient image quality, and the track buffer capacity, jump performance, jump time, and jump distance of the DVD decoder DCD used as the reproduction apparatus of the DVD encoded data must be determined. Based on these values, the reproduction time of the shortest interleaved unit is obtained from equations 3 and 4. Based on the reproduction time of each scene in the multi-scene period, it must then be determined whether equations 5 and 6 are satisfied. If equations 5 and 6 are not satisfied, the user must change the edit commands until equations 5 and 6 are satisfied by, for example, connecting part of the following scene to each scene in the multi-scene period.  \\n     [0432] When multi-angle edit commands are used, equation 7 must be satisfied for seamless switching, and edit commands matching the audio reproduction time with the reproduction time of each scene in each angle must be entered. If non-seamless switching is used, the user must enter commands to satisfy equation 8.  \\n     [0433] At step # 300 , the encoding system controller  200  first determines whether the target scene is to be seamlessly connected to the preceding scene based on the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0434] Note that when the preceding scene period is a multi-scene period comprising plural scenes but the presently selected target scene is a common scene (not in a multi-scene period), a seamless connection refers to seamlessly connecting the target scene with any one of the scenes contained in the preceding multi-scene period. When the target scene is a multi-scene period, a seamless connection still refers to seamlessly connecting the target scene with any one of the scenes from the same multi-scene period.  \\n     [0435] If step # 300  returns NO, i.e., a non-seamless connection is valid, the procedure moves to step # 400 .  \\n     [0436] At step # 400 , the encoding system controller  200  resets the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb indicating whether there is a seamless connection between the target and preceding scenes. The procedure then moves to step # 600 .  \\n     [0437] On the other hand, if step # 300  returns YES, i.e., there is a seamless connection to the preceding scene, the procedure moves to step # 500 .  \\n     [0438] At step # 500  the encoding system controller  200  sets the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb. The procedure then moves to step # 600 .  \\n     [0439] At step # 600  the encoding system controller  200  determines whether there is a seamless connection between the target and following scenes based on scenario data St 7 . If step # 600  returns NO, i.e., a non-seamless connection is valid, the procedure moves to step # 700 .  \\n     [0440] At step # 700 , the encoding system controller  200  resets the following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf indicating whether there is a seamless connection with the following scene. The procedure then moves to step # 900 .  \\n     [0441] However, if step # 600  returns YES, i.e., there is a seamless connection to the following scene, the procedure moves to step # 800 .  \\n     [0442] At step # 800  the encoding system controller  200  sets the following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf. The procedure then moves to step # 900 .  \\n     [0443] At step # 900  the encoding system controller  200  determines whether there is more than connection target scene, i.e., whether a multi-scene period is selected, based on the scenario data St 7 . As previously described, there are two possible control methods in multi-scene periods: parental lock control whereby only one of plural possible reproduction paths that can be constructed from the scenes in the multi-scene period is reproduced, and multi-angle control whereby the reproduction path can be switched within the multi-scene period to present different viewing angles.  \\n     [0444] If step # 900  returns NO, i.e., there are not multiple scenes, the procedure moves to step # 1000 .  \\n     [0445] At step # 1000  the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp identifying whether the VOB set comprises plural video objects VOB (a multi-scene period is selected) is reset, and the procedure moves to step # 1800  for encode parameter production. This encode parameter production subroutine is described below.  \\n     [0446] However, if step # 900  returns YES, there is a multi-scene connection, the procedure moves to step # 1100 .  \\n     [0447] At step # 1100 , the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp is set, and the procedure moves to step # 1200  whereat it is judged whether a multi-angle connection is selected, or not.  \\n     [0448] At step # 1200  it is determined whether a change is made between plural scenes in the multi-scene period, i.e., whether a multi-angle scene period is selected. If step # 1200  returns NO, i.e., no scene change is allowed in the multi-scene period as parental lock control reproducing only one reproduction path has been selected, the procedure moves to step # 1300 .  \\n     [0449] At step # 1300  the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm identifying whether the target connection scene is a multi-angle scene is reset, and the procedure moves to step # 1302 .  \\n     [0450] At step # 1302  it is determined whether either the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb or following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf is set. If step # 1302  returns YES, i.e., the target connection scene seamlessly connects to the preceding, the following, or both the preceding and following scenes, the procedure moves to step # 1304 .  \\n     [0451] At step # 1304  the interleave flag VOB_Fi identifying whether the VOB, the encoded data of the target scene, is interleaved is set. The procedure then moves to step # 1800 .  \\n     [0452] However, if step # 1302  returns NO, i.e., the target connection scene does not seamlessly connect to the preceding or following scene, the procedure moves to step # 1306 .  \\n     [0453] At step # 1306  the interleave flag VOB_Fi is reset, and the procedure moves to step # 1800 .  \\n     [0454] If step # 1200  returns YES, however, i. e., there is a multi-angle connection, the procedure moves to step # 1400 .  \\n     [0455] At step # 1400 , the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm and interleave flag VOB_Fi are set, and the procedure moves to step # 1500 .  \\n     [0456] At step # 1500  the encoding system controller  200  determines whether the audio and video can be seamlessly switched in a multi-angle scene period, i.e., at a reproduction unit smaller than the VOB, based on the scenario data St 7 . If step # 1500  returns NO, i.e., non-seamless switching occurs, the procedure moves to step # 1600 .  \\n     [0457] At step # 1600  the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV indicating whether angle changes within the multi-angle scene period are seamless or not is reset, and the procedure moves to step # 1800 .  \\n     [0458] However, if step # 1500  returns YES, i.e., seamless switching occurs, the procedure moves to step # 1700 .  \\n     [0459] At step # 1700  the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV is set, and the procedure moves to step # 1800 .  \\n     [0460] Therefore, as shown by the flow chart in FIG. 51, encode parameter production (step # 1800 ) is only begun after the editing information is detected from the above flag settings in the scenario data St 7  reflecting the user-defined editing instructions.  \\n     [0461] Based on the user-defined editing instructions detected from the above flag settings in the scenario data St 7 , information is added to the encoding information tables for the VOB Set units and VOB units as shown in FIGS. 27 and 28 to encode the source streams, and the encoding parameters of the VOB data units shown in FIG. 29 are produced, in step # 1800 . The procedure then moves to step # 1900  for audio and video encoding.  \\n     [0462] The encode parameter production steps (step # 1800 ) are described in greater detail below referring to FIGS. 52, 53,  54 , and  55 .  \\n     [0463] Based on the encode parameters produced in step # 1800 , the video data and audio data are encoded in step # 1900 , and the procedure moves to step # 2000 .  \\n     [0464] Note that the sub-picture data is normally inserted during video reproduction on an as-needed basis, and contiguity with the preceding and following scenes is therefore not usually necessary. Moreover, the sub-picture data is normally video information for one frame, and unlike audio and video data having an extended time-base, sub-picture data is usually static, and is not normally presented continuously. Because the present invention relates specifically to seamless and non-seamless contiguous reproduction as described above, description of sub-picture data encoding is omitted herein for simplicity.  \\n     [0465] Step # 2000  is the last step in a loop comprising steps # 300  to step # 2000 , and causes this loop to be repeated as many times as there are VOB Sets. This loop formats the program chain VTS_PGC#i to contain the reproduction sequence and other reproduction information for each VOB in the title (FIG. 16) in the program chain data structure, interleaves the VOB in the multi-scene periods, and completes the VOB Set data stream and VOB data stream needed for system stream encoding. The procedure then moves to step # 2100 .  \\n     [0466] At step # 2100  the VOB Set data stream is completed as the encoding information table by adding the total number of VOB Sets VOBS_NUM obtained as a result of the loop through step # 2000  to the VOB Set data stream, and setting the number of titles TITLE_NO defining the number of scenario reproduction paths in the scenario data St 7 . The procedure then moves-to-step # 2200 .  \\n     [0467] System stream encoding producing the VOB (VOB#i) data in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) (FIG. 16) is accomplished in step # 2200  based on the encoded video stream and encoded audio stream output from step # 1900 , and the encode parameters in FIG. 29. The procedure then moves to step # 2300 .  \\n     [0468] At step # 2300  the VTS information VTSI, VTSI management table VTSI_MAT, VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT, and the program chain information VTS_PGCI#i controlling the VOB data reproduction sequence shown in FIG. 16 are produced, and formatting to, for example, interleave the VOB contained in the multi-scene periods, is accomplished. The specific steps executed in this formatting operation are described below with reference to FIGS. 49, 50,  51 ,  52 , and  53 .  \\n     [0469] The encode parameter production subroutine shown as step # 1800  in FIG. 34B is described next using FIGS. 52, 53, and  54  using by way of example the operation generating the encode parameters for multi-angle control.  \\n     [0470] Starting from FIG. 35, the process for generating the encode parameters of a non-seamless switching stream with multi-angle control is described first. This stream is generated when step # 1500  in FIG. 34 returns NO and the following flags are set as shown: VOB_Fsb=1 or VOB_Fsf=1, VOB_Fp=1, VOB Fi=1, VOB_Fm=1, and VOB_FsV=0. The following operation produces the encoding information tables shown in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0471] At step # 1812 , the scenario reproduction sequence (path) contained in the scenario data St 7  is extracted, the VOB Set number VOBS_NO is set, and the VOB number VOB_NO is set for one or more VOB in the VOB Set.  \\n     [0472] At step # 1814  the maximum bit rate ILV_BR of the interleaved VOB is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE from the encode parameters is set based on the interleave flag VOB_Fi setting (=1).  \\n     [0473] At step # 1816 , the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT is extracted from the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0474] At step # 1818 , the video encode GOP structure GOPST values N=15 and M=3 are set, and the GOP structure fixing flag GOP_Fxflag is set (=1), based on the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp setting (=1).  \\n     [0475] Step # 1820  is the common VOB data setting routine, which is described below referring to the flow chart in FIG. 36. This common VOB data setting routine produces the encoding information tables shown in FIGS. 27 and 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0476] At step # 1822  the video material start time VOB_VST and video material end time VOB_VEND are extracted for each VOB, and the video encode start time V_STTM and video encode end time V_ENDTM are used as video encoding parameters.  \\n     [0477] At step # 1824  the audio material start time VOB_AST of each VOB is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the audio encode start time A_STTM is set as an audio encoding parameter.  \\n     [0478] At step # 1826  the audio material end time VOB_AEND is extracted for each VOB from the scenario data St 7 , and at a time not exceeding the VOB_AEND time. This time extracted at an audio access unit (AAU) is set as the audio encode end time A_ENDTM which is an audio encoding parameter. Note that the audio access unit AAU is determined by the audio encoding method.  \\n     [0479] At step # 1828  the audio start gap A_STGAP obtained from the difference between the video encode start time V_STTM and the audio encode start time A_STTM is defined as a system encode parameter.  \\n     [0480] At step # 1830  the audio end gap A_ENDGAP obtained from the difference between the video encode end time V_ENDTM and the audio encode end time A_ENDTM is defined as a system encode parameter.  \\n     [0481] At step # 1832  the video encoding bit rate V_BR is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the video encode bit rate V_RATE, which is the average bit rate of video encoding, is set as a video encoding parameter.  \\n     [0482] At step # 1834  the audio encoding bit rate A_BR is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the audio encode bit rate A_RATE is set as an audio encoding parameter.  \\n     [0483] At step # 1836  the video material type VOB_V_KIND is extracted from the scenario data St 7 . If the material is a film type, i.e., a movie converted to television broadcast format (so-called telecine conversion), reverse telecine conversion is set for the video encode mode V_ENCMD, and defined as a video encoding parameter.  \\n     [0484] At step # 1838  the audio coding method VOB_A_KIND is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the encoding method is set as the audio encode method A_ENCMD and set as an audio encoding parameter.  \\n     [0485] At step # 1840  the initial video encode data V_INTST sets the initial value of the VBV buffer to a value less than the VBV buffer end value set by the last video encode data V_ENDST, and defined as a video encoding parameter.  \\n     [0486] At step # 1842  the VOB number VOB_NO of the preceding connection is set to the preceding VOB number B_VOB_NO based on the setting (=1) of the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb, and set as a system encode parameter.  \\n     [0487] At step # 1844  the VOB number VOB_NO of the following connection is set to the following VOB number F_VOB_NO based on the setting (=1) of the following VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsf, and set as a system encode parameter.  \\n     [0488] The encoding information table and encode parameters are thus generated for a multi-angle VOB Set with non-seamless multi-angle switching control enabled.  \\n     [0489] The process for generating the encode parameters of a seamless switching stream with multi-angle control is described below with reference to FIG. 37. This stream is generated when step # 1500  in FIG. 34 returns YES and the following flags are set as shown: VOB_Fsb=1 or VOB_Fsf=1, VOB_Fp=1, VOB Fi=1, VOB Fm=1, and VOB_FsV=1. The following operation produces the encoding information tables shown in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0490] The following operation produces the encoding information tables shown in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0491] At step # 1850 , the scenario reproduction sequence (path) contained in the scenario data St 7  is extracted, the, VOB Set number VOBS_NO is set, and the VOB number VOB_NO is set for one or more VOB in the VOB Set.  \\n     [0492] At step # 1852  the maximum bit rate ILV_BR of the interleaved VOB is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE from the encode parameters is set based on the interleave flag VOB_Fi setting (=1).  \\n     [0493] At step # 1854 , the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT is extracted from the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0494] At step # 1856 , the video encode GOP structure GOPST values N=15 and M=3 are set, and the GOP structure fixing flag GOP_Fxflag is set (=1), based on the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp setting (=1).  \\n     [0495] At step # 1858 , the video encode GOP GOPST is set to \u201cclosed GOP\u201d based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB FsV setting (=1), and the video encoding parameters are thus defined.  \\n     [0496] Step # 1860  is the common VOB data setting routine, which is as described referring to the flow chart in FIG. 35. Further description thereof is thus omitted here.  \\n     [0497] The encode parameters of a seamless switching stream with multi-angle control are thus defined for a VOB Set with multi-angle control as described above.  \\n     [0498] The process for generating the encode parameters for a system stream in which parental lock control is implemented is described below with reference to FIG. 38. This stream is generated when step # 1200  in FIG. 34 returns NO and step # 1304  returns YES, i.e., the following flags are set as shown: VOB_Fsb=1 or VOB Fsf=1, VOB_Fp=1, VOB Fi=1, VOB_Fm=0. The following operation produces the encoding information tables shown in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0499] At step # 1870 , the scenario reproduction sequence (path) contained in the scenario data St 7  is extracted, the VOB Set number VOBS_NO is set, and the VOB number VOB_NO is set for one or more VOB in the VOB Set.  \\n     [0500] At step # 1872  the maximum bit rate ILV_BR of the interleaved VOB is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE from the encode parameters is set based on the interleave flag VOB_Fi setting (=1).  \\n     [0501] At step # 1872  the number of interleaved VOB divisions ILV_DIV is extracted from the scenario data St 7 .  \\n     [0502] Step # 1876  is the common VOB data setting routine, which is as described referring to the flow chart in FIG. 35. Further description thereof is thus omitted here.  \\n     [0503] The encode parameters of a system stream in which parental lock control is implemented are thus defined for a VOB Set with multi-scene selection control enabled as described above.  \\n     [0504] The process for generating the encode parameters for a system stream containing a single scene is described below with reference to FIG. 70. This stream is generated when step # 900  in FIG. 34 returns NO, i.e., when VOB_Fp=0. The following operation produces the encoding information tables shown in FIG. 27 and FIG. 28, and the encode parameters shown in FIG. 29.  \\n     [0505] At step # 1880 , the scenario reproduction sequence (path) contained in the scenario data St 7  is extracted, the VOB Set number VOBS_NO is set, and the VOB number VOB_NO is set for one or more VOB in the VOB Set.  \\n     [0506] At step # 1882  the maximum bit rate ILV_BR of the interleaved VOB is extracted from the scenario data St 7 , and the maximum video encode bit rate V_MRATE from the encode parameters is set based on the interleave flag VOB_Fi setting (=1).  \\n     [0507] Step # 1884  is the common VOB data setting routine, which is as described referring to the flow chart in FIG. 35. Further description thereof is thus omitted here.  \\n     [0508] These flow charts for defining the encoding information table and encode parameters thus generate the parameters for DVD video, audio, and system stream encoding by the DVD formatter.  \\n     [0509] Flow Chart: Formatter  \\n     [0510] The operation of the subroutine executed by the DVD formatter shown as step # 2300  in FIG. 34B is described next with reference to FIGS. 49, 59,  51 ,  52 , and  53 . This formatter subroutine generates the DVD multimedia bitstream.  \\n     [0511] The operation of the DVD encoder ECD  1100  according to the present invention is described with reference to the flow chart in FIG. 49. Note that those steps shown in FIG. 49 with a double line are subroutines.  \\n     [0512] At step # 2310  the program chain information VTS_PGCI is set to the VTSI management table VTSI_MAT for the number of titles TITLE_NUM based on the number of titles TITLE_NUM in the VOB Set data stream.  \\n     [0513] At step # 2312  it is determined whether multi-scene selection control is enabled based on the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp in the VOB Set data stream. If step # 2312  returns NO, i.e., multi-scene control is not enabled, the procedure moves to step # 2114 .  \\n     [0514] At step # 2314  the operation for coding a single scene (VOB) executed by the formatter  1100  of the authoring encoder EC shown in FIG. 25 is accomplished. This routine is described later.  \\n     [0515] If step # 2312  returns YES, i.e., multi-scene control is enabled, the procedure moves to step # 2116 .  \\n     [0516] At step # 2316  it is determined whether the information is to be interleaved or not based on the interleave flag VOB_Fi state in the VOB Set data stream. If step # 2316  returns NO, i.e., the information is not to be interleaved, the procedure moves to step # 2314 . If step # 2316  returns YES, i.e., the information is to be interleaved, the procedure moves to step # 2318 .  \\n     [0517] At step # 2318  it is determined whether multi-angle control is to be implemented based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm in the VOB Set data stream. If step # 2318  returns NO, the parental lock control routine in step # 2320  is executed. If step # 2318  returns YES, the procedure moves to step # 2322 .  \\n     [0518] At step # 2320  the operation for formatting the VOB Set for parental lock control is executed. This subroutine is shown in FIG. 52 and described below.  \\n     [0519] At step # 2322  it is determined whether multi-angle seamless switching is required based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV. If multi-angle switching is accomplished without seamless switching, i.e., with non-seamless switching and step # 2322  returns NO, the procedure moves to step # 2326 .  \\n     [0520] The multi-angle non-seamless switching control routine executed in step # 2326  by the formatter  1100  of the authoring encoder EC in FIG. 25 is described later with reference to FIG. 50.  \\n     [0521] If multi-angle switching is accomplished with seamless switching control, i.e., step # 2322  returns YES, the procedure moves to step # 2324 .  \\n     [0522] The multi-angle seamless switching control routine executed in step # 2324  by the formatter  1100  of the authoring encoder EC in FIG. 25 is described later with reference to FIG. 51.  \\n     [0523] The cell playback information (PCG information entries C_PBI) of the VTS information VTSI set as previously described is then recorded.  \\n     [0524] At step # 2330  it is determined whether all VOB Sets declared by the VOB Set number VOBS_NUM have been processed by the formatter. If NO, control loops back to step # 2312 , and the process runs again. If YES, all sets have been formatted, the procedure terminates.  \\n     [0525] Referring to FIG. 50, the multi-angle non-seamless switching control routine executed in step # 2326  when step # 2322 , FIG. 49, returns NO is described. This routine defines the interleaved arrangement of the multimedia bitstream MBS, the content of the cell playback information (C_PBI#i) shown in FIG. 16, and the information stored to the navigation pack NV shown in FIG. 20, in the generated DVD multimedia bitstream MBS.  \\n     [0526] At step # 2340  based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm setting (=1) declaring whether multi-angle control is applied in the multi-scene period, the cell block mode CBM (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene is declared according to the position of the angle data. For example, the cell block mode CBM of the MA 1  cell (FIG. 23) is declared as  01   b  to indicate the beginning of the cell block, the CBM of MA 2  is declared as  10   b  to indicate a cell between the first and last cells in the block, and the CBM of MA 3  is declared as  11   b  to indicate the end of the cell block.  \\n     [0527] At step # 2342  based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm setting (=1) declaring whether multi-angle control is applied in the multi-scene period, the cell block type CBT (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene is declared as  01   b  to indicate an \u201cangle.\u201dAt step # 2344  the seamless playback flag SPF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0528] At step # 2346  the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0529] At step # 2348  the interleaved allocation flag IAF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV state, which is set to 1 to indicate interleaving is required.  \\n     [0530] At step # 2350  the location of the navigation pack NV (relative sector number from the VOB beginning) is detected from the title editing unit (VOB below) obtained from the system encoder  900  in FIG. 25, the navigation pack NV is detected based on the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT information (a formatter parameter obtained in step # 1816 , FIG. 35), the location of the VOBU expressed as the number of sectors from the VOB beginning, for example, is thus obtained, and the title editing unit VOB is divided into interleave units using VOBU units.  \\n     [0531] For example, if in this example the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU MT is 2 sec and the presentation time of one VOBU is 0.5 sec., then the VOB is divided into interleave units of 4 VOBU each. Note that this allocation operation is applied to the VOB constituting each multi-scene data unit.  \\n     [0532] At step # 2352  the interleave units of each VOB obtained from step # 2350  are arranged in the cell block mode CBM sequence (cell block beginning, middle, and end cells) written as the VOB control information for each scene in step # 2340  to form the interleaved blocks as shown in FIG. 71 or  72 . The interleaved blocks are then added to the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS). Using the cell block mode CBM declarations above, for example, the angle data MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3  (FIG. 23) are arranged in that sequence.  \\n     [0533] At step # 2354  the relative sector number from the VOBU start is written to the VOB end pack address VOBU_EA (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU based on the VOBU position information obtained in step # 2350 .  \\n     [0534] At step # 2356  the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) are written as the addresses of the navigation packs NV of the first and last VOBU in each cell based on the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) data obtained in step # 2352 .  \\n     [0535] The angle #i VOBU start address NSML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-NSML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA of the non-seamless angle information NSML_AGLI (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU is written at step # 2358 . This address is expressed as the relative sector number inside the data of the interleaved blocks formed in step # 2352 , and declares the address information (FIG. 50) of the navigation pack NV contained in the VOBU of all angle scenes near the presentation start time of the VOBU being processed.  \\n     [0536] At step # 2360  \u201c7FFFFFFFh\u201d is written to the angle #i VOBU start address NSML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-NSML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA of the non-seamless angle information NSML_AGLI (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU if the VOBU being processed is the last VOBU of each scene in the multi-scene period.  \\n     [0537] This routine thus formats the interleaved blocks for multi-angle non-seamless switching control in the multi-scene period, and formats the cell control information as the reproduction control information for those multiple scenes.  \\n     [0538] Referring to FIG. 51, the multi-angle seamless switching control routine executed in step # 2324  when step # 2322 , FIG. 49, returns YES is described. This routine defines the interleaved arrangement of the multimedia bitstream MBS, the content of the cell playback information (C_PBI#i) shown in FIG. 16, and the information stored to the navigation pack NV shown in FIG. 20, in the generated DVD multimedia bitstream MBS.  \\n     [0539] At step # 2370  based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm setting (=1) declaring whether multi-angle control is applied in the multi-scene period, the cell block mode CBM (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene is declared according to the position of the angle data. For example, the cell block mode CBM of the MA 1  cell (FIG. 23) is declared as  01   b  to indicate the beginning of the cell block, the CBM of MA 2  is declared as  10   b  to indicate a cell between the first and last cells in the block, and the CBM of MA 3  is declared as  11   b  to indicate the end of the cell block.  \\n     [0540] At step # 2372  based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm setting (=1) declaring whether multi-angle control is applied in the multi-scene period, the cell block type CBT (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene is declared as  01   b  to indicate an \u201cangle.\u201d \\n     [0541] At step # 2374  the seamless playback flag SPF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0542] At step # 2376  the-STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0543] At step # 2378  the interleaved allocation flag IAF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV state, which is set to 1 to indicate interleaving is required.  \\n     [0544] At step # 2380  the location of the navigation pack NV (relative sector number from the VOB beginning) is detected from the title editing unit (VOB below) obtained from the system encoder  900  in FIG. 25, the navigation pack NV is detected based on the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT information (a formatter parameter obtained in step # 1854 , FIG. 37), the location of the VOBU expressed as the number of sectors from the VOB beginning, for example, is thus obtained, and the title editing unit VOB is divided into interleave units using VOBU units.  \\n     [0545] For example if in this example the minimum interleaved unit presentation time ILVU_MT is 2 sec and the presentation time of one VOBU is 0.5 sec., then the VOB is divided into interleave units of 4 VOBU each. Note that this allocation operation is applied to the VOB constituting each multi-scene data unit.  \\n     [0546] At step # 2382  the-interleave units of each VOB obtained from step # 2380  are arranged in the cell block mode CBM sequence (cell block beginning, middle, and end cells) written as the VOB control information for each scene in step # 2360  to form the interleaved blocks as shown in FIG. 71 or  72 . The interleaved blocks are then added to the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS). Using the cell block mode CBM declarations above, for example, the angle data MA 1 , MA 2 , and MA 3  (FIG. 23) are arranged in that sequence.  \\n     [0547] At step # 2384  the relative sector number from the VOBU start is written to the VOB end pack address VOBU_EA (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU based on the VOBU position information obtained in step # 2360 .  \\n     [0548] At step # 2386  the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) are written as the addresses of the navigation packs NV of the first and last VOBU in each cell based on the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) data obtained in step # 2382 .  \\n     [0549] At step # 2388  the relative sector number from the VOBU start is written to the VOB end pack address VOBU_EA (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU based on the interleave unit data obtained in step # 2370 .  \\n     [0550] The angle #i VOBU start address SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA of the seamless angle information SML_AGLI (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU is written at step # 2390 . This address is expressed as the relative sector number inside the data of the interleaved blocks formed in step # 2382 , and declares the address information of the navigation pack NV contained in the VOBU of all angle scenes with a start time contiguous to the reproduction end time of the VOBU being processed.  \\n     [0551] At step # 2392  \u201c7FFFFFFFh\u201d is written to the angle #i VOBU start address SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA of the seamless angle information SML_AGLI (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of the VOBU contained in the interleaved unit if the interleave unit arranged in step # 2382  is the last interleave unit of each scene in the multi-scene period.  \\n     [0552] This routine thus formats the interleaved blocks for multi-angle seamless switching control in the multi-scene period, and formats the cell control information as the reproduction control information for those multiple scenes.  \\n     [0553] The parental lock subroutine (step # 2320 , FIG. 49) executed when step # 2318  in FIG. 49 returns NO, i.e., when it is determined that parental lock control is implemented and not multi-angle control, is described next with reference to FIG. 52.  \\n     [0554] The parental lock subroutine described below writes the interleave unit arrangement of the multimedia bitstream, the content of the PGC information entries C_PBI #i (cell playback information) shown in FIG. 16, and the navigation pack NV information shown in FIG. 20, to the generated DVD multimedia bitstream.  \\n     [0555] At step # 2402  a value \u201c00b\u201d is written to the cell block mode CBM (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-angle flag VOB_Fm state, which is set to 0 to indicate that multi-angle control is not enabled in the multi-scene period.  \\n     [0556] At step # 2404  the seamless playback flag SPF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0557] At step # 2406  the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to  1 _in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to  1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0558] At step # 2408  the interleaved allocation flag IAF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FSV state, which is set to 1 to indicate interleaving is required.  \\n     [0559] At step # 2410  the navigation pack NV position information (the relative sector number from the VOB start) is detected from the title editing unit (VOB) obtained from the system encoder  900  (FIG. 25). The navigation pack NV is then detected based on the number of interleaved VOB divisions ILV_DIV, a formatter parameter obtained in step # 1874  in FIG. 38, to obtain the VOBU position information (number of sectors from the VOB start), and divide each VOB into the specified number of interleave units in VOBU units.  \\n     [0560] At step # 2412  the interleave units obtained in step # 2410  are then interleaved. For example, the interleave units are arranged in ascending VOB number sequence to create the interleaved blocks as shown in FIG. 71 or  72 , and the interleaved blocks are added to the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS).  \\n     [0561] At step # 2414  the relative sector number from the VOBU start is written to the VOB end pack address VOBU_EA (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU based on the VOBU position information obtained in step # 2186 .  \\n     [0562] At step # 2416  the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) are written as the addresses of the navigation packs NV of the first and last VOBU in each cell based on the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) data obtained in step # 2412 .  \\n     [0563] At step # 2418  the relative sector number to the last interleave unit pack is written to the ILVU end pack address ILVU_EA in the navigation pack NV of the VOBU forming the interleaved units based on the interleaved unit data obtained from step # 2412 .  \\n     [0564] At step # 2420 , the relative sector number in the interleaved block data formed in step # 2412  is written to the next-ILVU start address NT_ILVU_SA as the position information of the next ILVU in the navigation packs NV of the VOBU contained in the interleaved unit ILVU.  \\n     [0565] At step # 2422  the interleaved unit flag ILVU flag is set to 1 in the navigation packs NV of the VOBU contained in the interleaved unit ILVU.  \\n     [0566] At step # 2424 , the Unit END flag of the navigation pack NV in the last VOBU of the interleaved unit ILVU is set to 1.  \\n     [0567] At step # 2426  \u201cFFFFFFFFh\u201d is written to the next-ILVU start address NT_ILVU_SA of the navigation pack NV of the VOBU in the last interleaved unit ILVU of each VOB.  \\n     [0568] The operation described above thus formats the interleaved blocks to enable parental lock control in the multi-scene periods, and formats the control information in the cells, i.e., the cell playback control information for the multi-scene periods.  \\n     [0569] The single scene subroutine executed as step # 2314  in FIG. 49 when steps # 2312  or # 2316  return NO, i.e., when the scene is determined to be a single scene and not a multi-scene period, is described next using FIG. 53.  \\n     [0570] The single scene subroutine described below writes the interleave unit arrangement of the multimedia bitstream, the content of the PGC information entries C_PBI #i (cell playback information) shown in FIG. 16, and the navigation pack NV information shown in FIG. 20, to the generated DVD multimedia bitstream.  \\n     [0571] At step # 2430  a value \u201c00_b\u201d indicating a \u201cnon-cell block\u201d, i.e., that there is only one cell in the functional block, is written to the cell block mode CBM (FIG. 16) of the cell playback information blocks C_PDI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-scene flag VOB_Fp state, which is set to 0 to indicate that the scene is a single scene and not part of a multi-scene period.  \\n     [0572] At step # 2432  the interleaved allocation flag IAF (FIG. 16) is set to 0 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the multi-angle seamless switching flag VOB_FsV state, which is set to 0 to indicate interleaving is not required.  \\n     [0573] At step # 2434  the navigation pack NV position information (the relative sector number from the VOB start) is detected from the title editing unit (VOB) obtained from the system encoder  900  (FIG. 25), placed in the VOBU unit, and added to the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS), the video and other stream data of the multimedia bitstream.  \\n     [0574] At step # 2436  the relative sector number from the VOBU start is written to the VOB end pack address VOBU_EA (FIG. 20) in the navigation pack NV of each VOBU based on the VOBU position information obtained in step # 2434 .  \\n     [0575] At step # 2438  the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of and the end of, respectively, the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) of the value written as the addresses of the navigation packs NV of the first and last VOBU in cell based on the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) data obtained in step # 2434 .  \\n     [0576] At step # 2440  the state determined as a result of step # 300  or # 600  in FIG. 34, i.e., whether preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb is set to 1 indicating a seamless connection to the preceding or following scenes, is evaluated. If step # 2440  returns YES, the procedure moves to step # 2442 .  \\n     [0577] At step # 2442  the seamless playback flag SPF (FIG. 16) is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1 to indicate a seamless connection.  \\n     [0578] At step # 2444  the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to 1.  \\n     [0579] If step # 2440  returns NO, i.e., there is not a seamless connection to the preceding scene, the procedure moves to step # 2446 .  \\n     [0580] At step # 2446  the seamless playback flag SPF (FIG. 16) is set to 0 in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB Fsb state, which is set to 0 to indicate a non-seamless connection.  \\n     [0581] At step # 2448  the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to  0 _in the cell playback information blocks C_PBI #i containing the VOB control information for each scene based on the preceding VOB seamless connection flag VOB_Fsb state, which is set to  0.  \\n     [0582] The operation described above thus formats a multimedia bitstream for a single scene period, and records the control information in the cells, i.e., the cell playback control information (C_PBI #i, FIG. 16), and the information in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20), to the produced DVD multimedia bitstream.  \\n     [0583] Decoder Flow Charts  \\n     [0584] A. Disk-to-stream buffer transfer flow:  \\n     [0585] The decoding information table produced by the decoding system controller  2300  based on the scenario selection data St 51  is described below referring to FIGS. 54 and 55. The decoding information table comprises the decoding system table shown in FIG. 54, and the decoding table shown in FIG. 55.  \\n     [0586] As shown in FIG. 54, the decoding system table comprises a scenario information register and a cell information register. The scenario information register records the title number and other scenario reproduction information selected by the user and extracted from the scenario selection data St 51 . The cell information register extracts and records the information required to reproduce the cells constituting the program chain PGC based on the user-defined scenario information extracted into the scenario information register.  \\n     [0587] More specifically, the scenario information register contains plural sub-registers, i.e., the angle number ANGLE_NO_reg, VTS number VTS_NO_reg, PGC number VTS_PGCI_NO_reg, audio ID AUDIO_ID_reg, sub-picture ID SP_ID_reg, and the system clock reference SCR buffer SCR buffer.  \\n     [0588] The angle number ANGLE_NO_reg stores which angle is reproduced when there are multiple angles in the reproduction program chain PGC.  \\n     [0589] The VTS number VTS_NO_reg records the number of the next VTS reproduced from among the plural VTS on the disk.  \\n     [0590] The PGC number VTS_PGCI_NO_reg records which of the plural program chains PGC present in the video title set VTS is to be reproduced for parental lock control or other applications.  \\n     [0591] The audio ID AUDIO_ID_reg records which of the plural audio streams in the VTS are to be reproduced.  \\n     [0592] The sub-picture ID SP_ID_reg records which of the plural sub-picture streams is to be reproduced when there are plural sub-picture streams in the VTS.  \\n     [0593] The system clock reference SCR buffer SCR_buffer is the buffer for temporarily storing the system clock reference SCR recorded to the pack header as shown in FIG. 19. As described using FIG. 26, this temporarily stored system clock reference SCR is output to the decoding system controller  2300  as the bitstream control data St 63 .  \\n     [0594] The cell information register contains the following sub-registers: the cell block mode CBM_reg, cell block type CBT_reg, seamless reproduction flag SPF_reg., interleaved allocation flag IAF_reg, STC resetting flag STCDF, seamless angle change flag SACF_reg, first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg, and last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA_reg.  \\n     [0595] The cell block mode CBM_reg stores a value indicating whether plural cells constitute one functional block. If there are not plural cells in one functional block, CBM_reg stores N_BLOCK. If plural cells constitute one functional block, the value F_CELL is stored as the CBM_reg value of the first cell in the block, L_CELL is stored as the CBM_reg value of the last cell in the block, and BLOCK is stored as the CBM_reg of value all cells between the first and last cells in the block.  \\n     [0596] The cell block type CBT_reg stores a value defining the type of the block indicated by the cell block mode CBM_reg. If the cell block is a multi-angle block, A_BLOCK is stored; if not, N_BLOCK is stored.  \\n     [0597] The seamless reproduction flag SPF_reg stores a value defining whether that cell is seamless connected with the cell or cell block reproduced therebefore. If a seamless connection is specified, SML is stored; if a seamless connection is not specified, NSML is stored.  \\n     [0598] The interleaved allocation flag IAF_reg stores a value identifying whether the cell exists in a contiguous or interleaved block. If the cell is part of a an interleaved block, ILVB is stored; otherwise N_ILVB is stored.  \\n     [0599] The STC resetting flag STCDF defines whether the system time clock STC used for synchronization must be reset when the cell is reproduced; when resetting the system time clock STC is necessary, STC_RESET is stored; if resetting is not necessary, STC_NRESET is stored.  \\n     [0600] The seamless angle change flag SACF_reg stores a value indicating whether a cell in a multi-angle period should be connected seamlessly at an angle change. If the angle change is seamless, the seamless angle change flag SACF is set to SML; otherwise it is set to NSML.  \\n     [0601] The first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg stores the VOBU start address of the first cell in a block. The value of this address is expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by and expressed (stored) as the number of sectors.  \\n     [0602] The last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA_reg stores the VOBU start address of the last cell in the block. The value of this address is also expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) measured by and expressed (stored) as the number of sectors.  \\n     [0603] The decoding table shown in FIG. 55 is described below. As shown in FIG. 55, the decoding table comprises the following registers: information registers for non-seamless multi-angle control, information registers for seamless multi-angle control, a VOBU information register, and information registers for seamless reproduction.  \\n     [0604] The information registers for non-seamless multi-angle control comprise sub-registers NSML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA_reg-NSML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg.  \\n     [0605] NSML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA_reg-NSML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg record the NMSL_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-NMSL_AGL_C 9 _DSTA values in the PCI packet shown in FIG. 20.  \\n     [0606] The information registers for seamless multi-angle control comprise sub-registers SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA_reg-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg.  \\n     [0607] SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA reg-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg record the SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA values in the DSI packet shown in FIG. 20.  \\n     [0608] The VOBU information register stores the end pack address VOBU_EA in the DSI packet shown in FIG. 20.  \\n     [0609] The information registers for seamless reproduction comprise the following sub-registers: an interleaved unit flag ILVU_flag_reg, Unit END flag UNIT_END_flag_reg, Interleaved Unit End Address ILVU_EA_reg, Next Interleaved Unit Start Address NT_ILVU_SA_reg, the presentation start time of the first video frame in the VOB (Initial Video Frame Presentation Start Time) VOB_V_SPTM_reg, the presentation end time of the last video frame in the VOB (Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time) VOB_V_EPTM_reg, audio reproduction stopping time  1  VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, audio reproduction stopping time  2  VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, audio reproduction stopping period  1  VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and audio reproduction stopping period  2  VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0610] The interleaved unit flag ILVU_flag_reg stores the value indicating whether the video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block, and stores ILVU if it is, and N_ILVU if not.  \\n     [0611] The Unit END flag UNIT_END_flag_reg stores the value indicating whether the video object unit VOBU is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU. Because the interleaved unit ILVU is the data unit for continuous reading, the UNIT_END_flag_reg stores END if the VOBU currently being read is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU, and otherwise stores N_END.  \\n     [0612] The Interleaved Unit End Address ILVU_EA_reg stores the address of the last pack in the ILVU to which the VOBU belongs if the VOBU is in an interleaved block. This address is expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU.  \\n     [0613] The Next Interleaved Unit Start Address NT_ILVU_SA_reg stores the start address of the next interleaved unit ILVU if the VOBU is in an interleaved block. This address is also expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU.  \\n     [0614] The Initial Video Frame Presentation Start Time register VOB_V_SPTM_reg stores the time at which presentation of the first video frame in the VOB starts.  \\n     [0615] The Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time register VOB_V_EPTM_reg stores the time at which presentation of the last video frame in the VOB ends.  \\n     [0616] The audio reproduction stopping time  1  VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg stores the time at which the audio is to be paused to enable resynchronization, and the audio reproduction stopping period  1  VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg stores the length of this pause period.  \\n     [0617] The audio reproduction stopping time  2  VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg and audio reproduction stopping period  2  VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg store the same values.  \\n     [0618] The operation of the DVD decoder DCD according to the present invention as shown in FIG. 26 is described next below with reference to the flow chart in FIG. 56.  \\n     [0619] At step # 310202  it is first determined whether a disk has been inserted. If it has, the procedure moves to step # 310204 .  \\n     [0620] At step # 310204 , the volume file structure VFS (FIG. 21) is read, and the procedure moves to step # 310206 .  \\n     [0621] At step # 310206 , the video manager VMG (FIG. 21) is read and the video title set VTS to be reproduced is extracted. The procedure then moves to step # 310208 .  \\n     [0622] At step. # 310208 , the video title set menu address information VTSM_C_ADT is extracted from the VTS information VTSI, and the procedure moves to step # 310210 .  \\n     [0623] At step # 310210  the video title set menu VTSM_VOBS is read from the disk based on the video title set menu address information VTSM_C_ADT, and the title selection menu is presented.  \\n     [0624] The user is thus able to select the desired title from this menu in step # 310212 . If the titles include both contiguous titles with no user-selectable content, and titles containing audio numbers, sub-picture numbers, or multi-angle scene content, the user must also enter the desired angle number. Once the user selection is completed, the procedure moves to step # 310214 .  \\n     [0625] At step # 310214 , the VTS_PGCI #i program chain (PGC) data block corresponding to the title number selected by the user is extracted from the VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT, and the procedure moves to step # 310216 .  \\n     [0626] Reproduction of the program chain PGC then begins at step # 310216 . When program chain PGC reproduction is finished, the decoding process ends. If a separate title is thereafter to be reproduced as determined by monitoring key entry to the scenario selector, the title menu is presented again (step # 310210 ).  \\n     [0627] Program chain reproduction in step # 310216  above is described in further detail below referring to FIG. 57. The program chain PGC reproduction routine consists of steps # 31030 , # 31032 , # 31034 , and # 31035  as shown.  \\n     [0628] At step # 31030  the decoding system table shown in FIG. 54 is defined. The angle number ANGLE_NO_reg, VTS number VTS_NO_reg, PGC number VTS_PGCI_NO_reg, audio ID AUDIO_ID reg, and sub-picture ID SP_ID_reg are set according to the selections made by the user using the scenario selector  2100 .  \\n     [0629] Once the PGC to be reproduced is determined, the corresponding cell information (PGC information entries C_PBI #j) is extracted and the cell information register is defined. The sub-registers therein that are defined are the cell block mode CBM_reg, cell block type CBT_reg, seamless reproduction flag SPF_reg, interleaved allocation flag IAF_reg, STC resetting flag STCDF, seamless angle change flag SACF_reg, first cell VOBU start address C FVOBU SA reg, and last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA_reg.  \\n     [0630] Once the decoding system table is defined, the process transferring data to the stream buffer (step # 31032 ) and the process decoding the data in the stream buffer (step # 31034 ) are activated in parallel.  \\n     [0631] The process transferring data to the stream buffer (step # 31032 ) is the process of transferring data from the recording medium M to the stream buffer  2400 . This is, therefore, the processing of reading the required data from the recording medium M and inputting the data to the stream buffer  2400  according to the user-selected title information and the playback control information (navigation packs NV) written in the stream.  \\n     [0632] The routine shown as step # 31034  is the process for decoding the data stored to the stream buffer  2400  (FIG. 26), and outputting the decoded data to the video data output terminal  3600  and audio data output terminal  3700 . Thus, is the process for decoding and reproducing the data stored to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0633] Note that step # 31032  and step # 31034  are executed in parallel.  \\n     [0634] The processing unit of step # 31032  is the cell, and as processing one cell is completed, it is determined in step # 31035  whether the complete program chain PGC has been processed. If processing the complete program chain PGC is not completed, the decoding system table is defined for the next cell in step # 31030 . This loop from step # 31030  through step # 31035  is repeated until the entire program chain PGC is processed.  \\n     [0635] The stream buffer data transfer process of step # 31032  is described in further detail below referring to FIG. 70. The stream buffer data transfer process (step # 31032 ) comprises steps # 31040 , # 31042 , # 31044 , # 31046 , and # 31048  shown in the figure.  \\n     [0636] At step # 31040  it is determined whether the cell is a multi-angle cell. If not, the procedure moves to step # 30144 .  \\n     [0637] At step # 31044  the non-multi-angle cell decoding process is executed.  \\n     [0638] However, if step # 30140  returns YES because the cell is a multi-angle cell, the procedure moves to step # 30142  where the seamless angle change flag SACF is evaluated to determine whether seamless angle reproduction is specified.  \\n     [0639] If seamless angle reproduction is specified, the seamless multi-angle decoding process is executed in step # 30146 . If seamless angle reproduction is not specified, the non-seamless multi-angle decoding process is executed in step # 30148 .  \\n     [0640] The non-multi-angle cell decoding process (step # 31044 , FIG. 62) is described further below with reference to FIG. 63. Note that the non-multi-angle cell decoding process (step # 31044 ) comprises the steps # 31050 , # 31052 , and # 31054 .  \\n     [0641] The first step # 31050  evaluates the interleaved allocation flag IAF_reg to determine whether the cell is in an interleaved block. If it is, the non-multi-angle interleaved block process is executed in step # 31052 .  \\n     [0642] The non-multi-angle interleaved block process (step # 31052 ) processes scene branching and connection where seamless connections are specified in, for example, a multi-scene period.  \\n     [0643] However, if the cell is not in an interleaved block, the non-multi-angle contiguous block process is executed in step # 31054 . Note that the step # 31054  process is the process executed when there is no scene branching or connection.  \\n     [0644] The non-multi-angle interleaved block process (step # 31052 , FIG. 63) is described further below with reference to FIG. 64.  \\n     [0645] At step # 31060  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA read from the C_FVOBU_SA_reg register.  \\n     [0646] More specifically, the address data C_FVOBU_SA_reg stored in the decoding system controller  2300  (FIG. 26) is input as bitstream reproduction control signal St 53  to the reproduction controller  2002 . The reproduction controller  2002  thus controls the recording media drive unit  2004  and signal processor  2008  to move the reading head  2006  to the specified address, data is read, error correction code ECC and other signal processing is accomplished by the signal processor  2008 , and the cell start VOBU data is output as the reproduced bitstream St 61  to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31062 .  \\n     [0647] At step # 31062  the DSI packet data in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20) is extracted in the stream buffer  2400 , the decoding table is defined, and the procedure moves to step # 31064 . The registers set in the decoding table are the ILVU_EA_reg, NT_ILVU_SA_reg, VOB_V_SPTM_reg, VOB_V_EPTM_reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0648] At step # 31064  the data from the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg to the ILVU end pack address ILVU EA_reg, i.e., the data for one interleaved unit ILVU, is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31066 .  \\n     [0649] More specifically, the address data ILVU_EA_reg stored in the decoding system controller  2300  (FIG. 26) is supplied to the reproduction controller  2002 . The reproduction controller  2002  thus controls the recording media drive unit  2004  and signal processor  2008  to read the data to the ILVU_EA_reg address, and after error correction code ECC and other signal processing is accomplished by the signal processor  2008 , the data for the first ILVU in the cell is output as the reproduced bitstream St 61  to the stream buffer  2400 . It is thus possible to output the data for one contiguous interleaved unit ILVU on the recording medium M to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0650] At step # 31066  it is determined whether all interleaved units in the interleaved block have been read and transferred. If the interleaved unit ILVU processed is the last ILVU in the interleaved block, \u201c 0\u00d77_FFFFFFF\u201d indicating termination is set to the next-ILVU start address NT_ILVU_SA_reg as the next read address. If all interleaved units in the interleaved block have thus been processed, the procedure moves to step #31068.    \\n     [0651] At step # 31068  the reading head  2006  is again jumped to the address NT_ILVU_SA_reg of the next interleave unit to be reproduced, and the procedure loops back to step # 31062 . Note that this jump is also accomplished as described above, and the loop from step # 31062  to step # 31068  is repeated.  \\n     [0652] However, if step # 31066  returns YES, i.e., all interleaved unit ILVU in the interleaved block have been transferred, step # 31052  terminates.  \\n     [0653] The non-multi-angle interleaved block process (step # 31052 ) thus transfers the data of one cell to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0654] The non-multi-angle contiguous block process is executed in step # 31054 , FIG. 63, is described further below with reference to FIG. 65.  \\n     [0655] At step # 31070  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA read from the C_FVOBU_SA_reg register. This jump is also accomplished as described above, and the loop from step # 31072  to step # 31076  is initiated.  \\n     [0656] At step # 31072  the DSI packet data in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20) is extracted in the stream buffer  2400 , the decoding table is defined, and the procedure moves to step # 31074 . The registers set in the decoding table are the VOBU_EA_reg, VOB_V_SPTM_reg, VOB_V_EPTM_reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0657] At step # 31074  the data from the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg to the end pack address VOBU_EA_reg, i.e., the data for one video object unit VOBU, is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31076 . The data for one video object unit VOBU contiguously arrayed to the recording medium M can thus be transferred to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0658] At step # 31076  it is determined whether all cell data has been transferred. If all VOBU in the cell has not been transferred, the data for the next VOBU is read continuously, and the process loops back to step # 31070 .  \\n     [0659] However, if all VOBU data in the cell has been transferred as determined by the C_LVOBU_SA_reg value in step # 31076 , the non-multi-angle contiguous block process (step # 31054 ) terminates. This process thus transfers the data of one cell to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0660] Another method of accomplishing the non-multi-angle cell decoding process (step # 31044 , FIG. 62) is described below with reference to FIG. 64.  \\n     [0661] At step # 31080  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg, and the first VOBU data in the cell is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31081 .  \\n     [0662] At step # 31081  the DSI packet data in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20) is extracted in the stream buffer  2400 , the decoding table is defined, and the procedure moves to step # 31082 . The registers set in the decoding table are the SCR buffer, VOBU_EA_reg, ILVU_flag_reg, UNIT_END_flag_reg, ILVU_EA_reg, NT_ILVU_SA_reg, VOB_V_SPTM_reg, VOB_V_EPTM_reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0663] At step # 31082  the data from the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg to the end pack address VOBU_EA_reg, i.e., the data for one video object unit VOBU, is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31083 .  \\n     [0664] At step # 31083  is determined whether all cell VOBU data has been transferred. If it has, the process (step # 31044 ) terminates. If it has not, the procedure moves to step # 31084 .  \\n     [0665] At step # 31084  it is determined whether the VOBU is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit. If not, the process loops back to step # 31081 . If so, the procedure advances to step # 31085 . It is thus possible to transfer one cell of data in VOBU units to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0666] The loop from step # 31081  to step # 31084  repeats as described above.  \\n     [0667] At step # 31085  it is determined whether the interleaved unit ILVU is the last in the interleaved block. If so, step # 31044  terminates. If not, the procedure advances to step # 31086 .  \\n     [0668] At step # 31086  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the address NT_ILVU_SA_reg of the next interleave unit, and the procedure loops back to step # 31081 . It is thus possible to transfer the data for one cell to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0669] The seamless multi-angle decoding process executed in step # 31046 , FIG. 62, is described below referring to FIG. 67.  \\n     [0670] At step # 31090  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA read from the C_FVOBU_SA_reg register, and the first VOBU data in the cell is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31091 . This jump is also accomplished as described above, and the loop from step # 31091  to step # 31095  is initiated.  \\n     [0671] At step # 31091  the DSI packet data in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20) is extracted in the stream buffer  2400 , the decoding table is defined, and the procedure moves to step # 31092 . The registers set in the decoding table are the ILVU_EA_reg, SML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA_reg-SML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg, VOB_V_SPTM_reg, VOB_V_EPTM_reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0672] At step # 31092  the data from the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg to the ILVU end pack address ILVU_EA_reg, i.e., the data for one ILVU, is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31093 . It is thus possible to output the data for one contiguous interleaved unit ILVU on the recording medium M to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0673] At step # 31093  the ANGLE_NO_reg is updated, and the procedure moves to step # 31094 . This update operation resets the ANGLE_NO_reg to the angle number of the angle selected by the user when the user changes the angle using the scenario selector  2100  (FIG. 26).  \\n     [0674] At step # 31094  it is determined whether the angle cell data has all been transferred. If all ILVU in the cell have not been transferred, the procedure moves to step # 31095 . If all ILVU in the cell have been transferred, the process terminates.  \\n     [0675] At step # 31095  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the next angle (SML_AGL_C#n_reg), and the process loops back to step # 31091 . Note that SML_AGL_C#n_reg is the address of the angle to which the ANGLE_NO_reg was updated in step # 31093 .  \\n     [0676] It is thus possible to transfer the data for the angle selected by the user to the stream buffer  2400  in ILVU units.  \\n     [0677] The non-seamless multi-angle decoding process is executed in step # 30148 , FIG. 62, is described below referring to FIG. 68.  \\n     [0678] At step # 31100  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA read from the C_FVOBU_SA_reg register, and the first VOBU data in the cell is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31101 . This jump is also accomplished as described above, and the loop from step # 31101  to step # 31106  is initiated.  \\n     [0679] At step # 31101  the DSI packet data in the navigation pack NV (FIG. 20) is extracted in the stream buffer  2400 , the decoding table is defined, and the procedure moves to step # 31102 . The registers set in the decoding table are the VOBU_EA_reg, NSML_AGL_C 1 _DSTA_reg, NSML_AGL_C 9 _DSTA_reg, VOB_V_SPTM_reg, VOB_V_EPTM_reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 1 _reg, VOB_A_STP_PTM 2 _reg, VOB_A_GAP_LEN 1 _reg, and VOB_A_GAP_LEN 2 _reg.  \\n     [0680] At step # 31102  the data from the first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA_reg to the end pack address VOBU_EA_reg, i.e., the data for one VOBU, is transferred to the stream buffer  2400 . The procedure then moves to step # 31103 . It is thus possible to output the data for one contiguous video object unit VOBU on the recording medium M to the stream buffer  2400 .  \\n     [0681] At step # 31103  the ANGLE_NO_reg is updated, and the procedure moves to step # 31104 . This update operation resets the ANGLE_NO_reg to the angle number of the angle selected by the user when the user changes the angle using the scenario selector  2100  (FIG. 26).  \\n     [0682] At step # 31104  it is determined whether the angle cell data has all been transferred. If all VOBU in the cell have not been transferred, the procedure moves to step # 31105 . If all VOBU in the cell have been transferred, the process terminates.  \\n     [0683] At step # 31105  the reading head  2006  is jumped to the next angle (NSML_AGL_C#n_reg), and the process advances to step # 31106 . Note that NSML_AGL C#n_reg is the address of the angle to which the ANGLE_NO_reg was updated in step # 31103 .  \\n     [0684] It is thus possible to transfer the data for the angle selected by the user to the stream buffer  2400  in VOBU units.  \\n     [0685] Step # 31106  is an effective step for high speed angle switching, and simply clears the stream buffer  2400 . By thus clearing the stream buffer  2400  the data for the newly selected angle can be reproduced without reproducing the angle data that is still not decoded. In other words, clearing the stream buffer  2400  enables faster response to user operations.  \\n     [0686] It is very important that DVD decoder according to the present invention can promptly moves to the next data reading process and effectively performs the data reading once after the detection of the end of data such as interleave unit ILVU and video object unit VOBU for the sake of seamless reproduction which is one of main targets of the present invention.  \\n     [0687] With reference to FIG. 69, a construction of the stream buffer  2400  which can performs the end detection of interleave unit ILVU is described briefly. The stream buffer  2400  comprises a VOB buffer  2402 , a system buffer  2404 , a navigation pack extractor  2406 , and a data counter  2408 . The system buffer  2404  temporarily stores the title control data VTSI(FIG. 16) included in signal St 61 , and outputs a control information St 2450  (St 63 ) such as VTS_PGC.  \\n     [0688] The VOB buffer  2402  temporarily stores the title VOB data VTSTT_VOB (FIG. 16), and the stream St 67  to the system decoder  2500 .  \\n     [0689] The NV (navigation pack) extractor  2406  receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer  2402 , and extracts the navigation pack NV therefrom. The NV extractor  2406  furthermore extracts the VOBU final pack address COBU_EA or ILVU final pack address ILVU_EA which are the DSI generation information DSI_GI shown in FIG. 19 to produce a pack address information St 2452  (St 63 ).  \\n     [0690] The data counter  2408  receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer  2402 , and counts each of pack data shown in FIG. 19 byte by byte. Then, the data counter  2408  produces a pack input terminating signal St 2454  (St 63 ) at the time when the inputting of pack data is completed.  \\n     [0691] Due to its construction shown in FIG. 69, the stream buffer  2400  performs the VOBU data transfer as examples at step # 31064  of FIG. 64, as follows. The stream buffer  2400  outputs the VOBU data for the NV extractor  2406  and data counter  2408  at the same time when the VOBU buffer  2400  receives the VODI data on the top of interleave unit ILVU. As a result, the NV extractor  2406  can extracts the data of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_SA at the same time with the inputting of navigation pack data NV, and outputs thereof as signal St 2452  (St 63 ) to the decode system controller  2300  (FIG. 26).  \\n     [0692] The decode system controller  2300  stores the signal St 2452  into the ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and then start to counts the number of packs based on the pack terminating signal  2452  from the data counter  2408 . Based on the fore mentioned the counted value of packs and ILVU_EA_reg, the decode system controller  2300  detects the instance when the inputting of final pack data of ILVU is completed, or the inputting final byte data of the final pack of the ILVU is completed. Then, the controller  2300  further give a command for the bitstream reproducer  2000  to move to the position having a sector address indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg. The bitstream producer  2000  moves to the sector address indicated NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and starts to read the data. Thus, the detection of final end of ILVU and reading process for the next ILVU can be performed effectively.  \\n     [0693] In the above, an example where the multimedia data MBS is reproduced by the bitstream reproducer  2000  without a buffering process, and is inputted to the stream buffer  2499 . However, in the case that the signal processor  2008  of the bitstream reproducer  2000  is incorporated with a buffer for error correction process, for example, the controller  2300  gives a moving command to reproducer  2000  so that the reproducer  2000  moves to the reading position indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg after completion of the final pack data of fore mentioned ILVU and clearing the internal buffer of the reproducer  2000 . Thus, the effective reproduction of ILVU data even when the bitstream reproducer  2000  includes a buffer for error correction code (ECC) process.  \\n     [0694] Furthermore, when the bitstream producer  2000  has a buffer for ECC process, the data can be transferred effectively by providing any means having a function equivalent to that of data counter  2408  (FIG. 69). In other words, the bitstream reproducer  2000  generates the pack input completion signal St 62 ; the decode system controller  2300  gives a command based on the signal St 62  the bitstream reproducer  200  to move to the reading position having sector address designated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg. As apparent from the above, the data can be transferred effectively even when the bitstream reproducer  2000  has a function to buffer the data reproduced from the recording media M.  \\n     [0695] It is to be noted that the apparatus and method substantially the same as those described in the above with respect to the interleave unit ILVU can be used for the detection VOBU end. In other words, by replacing the extraction of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_Sa, and the storing of ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg with the extraction of VOBU_EA and storing VOBU_EA_reg, the apparatus and method according to the present invention, described above, can be used for the detection of unatend. This is effective for the VOBU data transferring operations shown at steps # 31074 , # 31082 , # 31092 , and # 31102 .  \\n     [0696] Thus, the reading of data such as ILVU and VOBU can be performed effectively.  \\n     [0697] Decoding Process in the Stream Buffer  \\n     [0698] The process for decoding data in the stream buffer  2400  shown as step # 31034  in FIG. 57 is described below referring to FIG. 58. This process (step # 31034 ) comprises steps # 31110 , # 31112 , # 31114 , and # 31116 .  \\n     [0699] At step # 31110  data is transferred in pack units from the stream buffer  2400  to the system decoder  2500  (FIG. 26). The procedure then moves to step # 31112 .  \\n     [0700] At step # 31112  the pack data is from the stream buffer  2400  to each of the buffers, i.e., the video buffer  2600 , sub-picture buffer  2700 , and audio buffer  2800 .  \\n     [0701] At step # 31112  the Ids of the user-selected audio and sub-picture data, i.e., the audio ID AUDIO_ID_reg and the sub-picture ID SP_ID_reg stored to the scenario information register shown in FIG. 54, are compared with the stream ID and sub-stream ID read from the packet header (FIG. 19), and the matching packets are output to the respective buffers. The procedure then moves to step # 31114 .  \\n     [0702] The decode timing of the respective decoders (video, sub-picture, and audio decoders) is controlled in step # 31114 , i.e., the decoding operations of the decoders are synchronized, and the procedure moves to step # 31116 .  \\n     [0703] The respective elementary strings are then decoded at step # 31116 . The video decoder  3801  thus reads and decodes the data from the video buffer, the sub-picture decoder  3100  reads and decodes the data from the sub-picture buffer, and the audio decoder  3200  reads and decodes the data from the audio buffer.  \\n     [0704] This stream buffer data decoding process then terminates when these decoding processes are completed.  \\n     [0705] The decoder synchronization process of step # 31114 , FIG. 58, is described below with reference to FIG. 59. This processes comprises steps # 31120 , # 31122 , and # 31124 .  \\n     [0706] At step # 31120  it is determined whether a seamless connection is specified between the current cell and the preceding cell. If a seamless connection, the procedure moves to step # 31122 , if not, the procedure moves to step # 31124 .  \\n     [0707] A process synchronizing operation for producing seamless connections is executed in step # 31122 , and a process synchronizing operation for non-seamless connections is executed in step # 31124 .  \\n     [0708] To achieve seamless multi-scene reproduction control, it is necessary to seamlessly reproduce the connections between VOB. Except when a VOB, which is normally a single-stream title editing unit, is divided into discrete streams, however, there is no contiguity between the SCR and PTS at the connection. The problems relating to reproducing VOB of which the SCR and PTS are not contiguous are described below.  \\n     [0709] Note that the presentation time stamp PTS declaring the video presentation start time is referenced below as the VPTS, the decoding time stamp DTS declaring the video decode start time is referenced as VDTS, and the presentation time stamp PTS declaring the audio reproduction, or presentation, start time is referenced as APTS below.  \\n     [0710] The relationship between the SCR APTS, and VPTS values and recording positions in the VOB are shown in FIG. 47 and described below. For simplification this description is limited to the SCR and PTS parameters. The top SCR value is recorded with the PTS to both the middle audio stream and bottom video stream. If the positions on the horizontal axis are approximately the same, approximately the same SCR value is recorded to each stream.  \\n     [0711] Tse is the time indicated by the SCR of the last pack in the VOB; Tve is the time indicated by the VPTS of the last video pack in the VOB; Tae is the time indicated by the APTS of the last audio pack in the VOB; Tvd is the video decode buffer delay time; and Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time.  \\n     [0712]FIG. 48 is a time line from input of the VOB shown in FIG. 47 to the system decoder to output of the last audio and video reproduction data. The horizontal axis shows the passage of time t, and the vertical axis shows the SCR value, which indicates the time transfer should be accomplished, and the PTS values, which indicate the time reproduction should be accomplished.  \\n     [0713] Both audio and video outputs are thus delayed by the respective decode buffers referenced to the system clock reference SCR, and while the audio and video data are input substantially simultaneously, the video data is reproduced at a slight delay after the audio data. This delay is caused by the difference in the video and audio decode buffer delay times.  \\n     [0714] In addition, when two VOB are connected, there is no contiguity between the SCR and PTS at the connection except when a single-stream VOB is split into separate streams.  \\n     [0715] Contiguous reproduction of VOB # 1  and VOB # 2  having non-contiguous SCR and PTS parameters is described below referring to FIG. 46.  \\n     [0716]FIG. 46 also shows the relationship between the SCR, APTS, and VPTS values and recording positions in each VOB.  \\n     [0717] The system clock reference SCR is time information indicating the pack transfer time, and is recorded with each pack; APTS is the audio playback starting time information recorded with each audio packet; and VPTS is the video playback starting time information recorded with each video packet. The system clock STC is a reference clock for decoder synchronization control.  \\n     [0718] Tsel is the time indicated by the SCR of the last pack in VOB # 1 ; Tael is the time indicated by the last APTS in VOB # 1 ; and Tvel is the time indicated by the last VPTS in VOB # 1 .  \\n     [0719] Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time; Tvd is the video decode buffer delay time; and the horizontal axis indicates the passage of time t.  \\n     [0720] What is important to note here is that synchronizing the audio and video so that the reproduced audio and video signals are output at the time the system clock STC equals the APTS and VPTS values in the stream.  \\n     [0721] To maintain the reference clock for transferring VOB to the system decoder, the first system clock reference SCR value in VOB # 2  must be set to the STC initializer at precisely time Tse 1 . However, because reproduction and output of VOB # 1  have not been completed at this time point, the audio and video still to be output from VOB # 1  after time Tse 1  cannot be normally reproduced because the reference clock is lost.  \\n     [0722] Furthermore, even if the SCR value of the STC initializer is set at the audio end time Tae 1 , i.e., later than the system clock reference SCR time Tse 1 , the reference clock at which the first pack in VOB # 2  should be transferred is lost, and the reference clock for the VOB # 1  video output to be reproduced after time Tae 1  is lost.  \\n     [0723] The same problem also occurs if the system clock reference SCR is set to the STC initializer at time Tve 1 .  \\n     [0724] When there is a one-to-one correspondence between the VOB reproduced first, i.e., the first VOB, and the VOB reproduced thereafter, i.e., the second VOB, this problem can be avoided by assuring that the first SCR value of the second VOB is contiguous to the last SCR of the first VOB. However, when common data is shared between plural titles, there is a many-to-one relationship between the first VOB and the many VOB that may be reproduced thereafter.  \\n     [0725] When contiguously reproducing a second VOB # 2  following a first VOB # 1 , it is therefore necessary to destroy any remaining VOB # 1  data in the decode buffer at time Tsel, and seamless reproduction in which the audio and video are not intermitted is not possible.  \\n     [0726] A method(s) for seamlessly reproducing VOB of which the SCR and PTS are not contiguous is described by means of the two embodiments of the invention below.  \\n     [0727] Synchronization Controller: Embodiment 1  \\n     [0728] A first embodiment of the synchronizer  2900  shown in FIG. 26 is described according to the present invention with reference to FIG. 32 below. As shown in FIG. 32, the synchronizer  2900  comprises a system clock STC generator  2902 , PTS/DTS extractor  2904 , video decoder synchronizer  2906 , sub-picture decoder synchronizer  2908 , audio decoder synchronizer  2910 , and system decoder synchronizer  2912 .  \\n     [0729] The STC generator  2902  generates the system clock for each decoder, and supplies the synchronization system clock STC to the video decoder synchronizer  2906 , sub-picture decoder synchronizer  2908 , audio decoder synchronizer  2910 , and system decoder synchronizer  2912 . The STC generator  2902  is described in detail below with reference to FIG. 39.  \\n     [0730] The PTS/DTS extractor  2904  extracts the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS from the synchronization control data St 81 , and supplies the PTS and DTS to the decoder synchronizers.  \\n     [0731] The video decoder synchronizer  2906  generates the video stream decoding start signal St 89  based on the STC from the STC generator  2902  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting video decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  2904 . More specifically, the video decoder synchronizer  2906  generates the video stream decoding start signal St 89  when the STC-and DTS match.  \\n     [0732] The sub-picture decoder synchronizer  2908  generates the sub-picture stream decoding start signal St 91  based on the STC from the STC generator  2902  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting sub-picture decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  2904 . More specifically, the sub-picture decoder synchronizer  2908  generates the sub-picture stream decoding start signal St 91  when the STC and DTS match.  \\n     [0733] The audio decoder synchronizer  2910  generates the audio stream decoding start signal St 93  based on the STC from the STC generator  2902  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting audio decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  2904 . More specifically, the audio decoder synchronizer  2910  generates the audio stream decoding start signal St 93  when the STC and DTS match.  \\n     [0734] The system decoder synchronizer  2912  outputs the STC from the STC generator  2902  as the system clock St 79 . The system clock St 79  is used to control pack transfers from the stream buffers to the system decoder. In other words, if the STC value exceeds the SCR value in the pack, the pack data is transferred from the stream buffer to the system decoder.  \\n     [0735] The structure and operation of the STC generator  2902  are described in detail below with reference to FIG. 39. As shown in FIG. 39, the STC generator  2902  comprises a system clock STC initializer  32010 , STC offset calculator  32012 , STC counter  32014 , STC regenerator  32016 , STC selection controller  32018 , STC selector for video decoder  32020 , STC selector for sub-picture decoder  32022 , STC selector for audio decoder  32024 , and STC selector for system decoder  32026 .  \\n     [0736] The STC offset calculator  32012  calculates the offset value STCof used to update the system clock STC for contiguous reproduction of two VOBs with different initial system clock STC values (SCR).  \\n     [0737] More specifically, the offset value STCof is calculated by subtracting the Initial Video Frame Presentation Start Time VOB_V_SPTM_reg value of the next VOB to be reproduced from the Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time VOB_V_EPTM_reg (see FIG. 39) of the VOB reproduced first.  \\n     [0738] The STC counter  32014  is a sequential counter that counts from a set value synchronized to the system clock, and generates the reference clock STCc for each decoder.  \\n     [0739] The STC regenerator  32016  outputs a reset system clock STCr by subtracting the offset value STCof calculated by the STC offset calculator  32012  from the reference clock STCc supplied from the STC counter  32014 .  \\n     [0740] The system clock STC initializer  32010  selects and sets the SCR from the first pack in the VOB, or the reset system clock STCr output from the STC regenerator  32016 , according to the control signal from the STC selection controller  32018 . The value set by the STC initializer  32010  is the initial value used by the STC counter  32014 .  \\n     [0741] The STC selector for video decoder  32020  selects either the output STCc from the STC counter  32014  or the output STCr from the STC regenerator  32016  according to the control signal from the STC selection controller  32018 , and outputs the selected signal to the video decoder synchronizer  2906 .  \\n     [0742] The STC selector for sub-picture decoder  32022  similarly selects either output STCc or output STCr according to the control signal from the STC selection controller  32018 , and outputs the selected signal to the sub-picture decoder synchronizer  2908 .  \\n     [0743] The STC selector for audio decoder  32024  similarly selects either output STCc or output STCr according to the control signal from the STC selection controller  32018 , and outputs the selected signal to the audio decoder synchronizer  2910 .  \\n     [0744] The STC selector for system decoder  32026  similarly selects either output STCc or output STCr according to the control signal from the STC selection controller  32018 , and outputs the selected signal to the system decoder synchronizer  2912 .  \\n     [0745] The operation of the STC selection controller  32018  during non-seamless reproduction is described below with reference to FIG. 60. During non-seamless operation (when the SPF_reg flag_SML), all STC selectors, i.e., STC selector for video decoder  32020 , STC selector for sub-picture decoder  32022 , STC selector for audio decoder  32024 , and STC selector for-system decoder  32026 , select and output the reference clock STCc. More specifically, the STC selectors synchronize decoder operation based on the reference clock STCc output by the STC counter  32014 .  \\n     [0746] The operation of the STC selection controller  32018  during seamless reproduction (when the SPF_reg flag_SML) is also described below with reference to FIG. 40 and FIG. 61.  \\n     [0747]FIG. 40 also shows the relationship between the SCR, APTS, VDTS, and VPTS values and recording positions in each stream when two VOBs # 1  and # 2  are connected and seamless reproduced.  \\n     [0748] The system clock reference SCR is time information indicating the pack transfer time, and is recorded with each pack; APTS is the audio playback starting time information recorded with each audio packet; VDTS is the video decode start time information recorded with each video packet; and VPTS is the video playback starting time information recorded with each video packet. The system clock STC is a reference clock for decoder synchronization control.  \\n     [0749] Tsel (T 1 ) is the time indicated by the SCR of the last pack in VOB # 1 ; Tae 1  (T 2 ) is the time indicated by the last APTS in VOB # 1 ; Tde 1  (T 3 ) is the time indicated by the last VDTS in VOB # 1 ; and Tve 1  (T 4 ) is the time indicated by the last VPTS in VOB # 1 , i.e., the Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time VOB_V_EPTM identified by the last VPTS in VOB # 1 .  \\n     [0750] Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time; and Tvd is the video decode buffer delay time.  \\n     [0751] Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time; Tdd is the video decode buffer delay time; and Tve is the sum of the video decode buffer delay time and the delay until video presentation.  \\n     [0752]FIG. 61 is a flow chart used to describe the operation of the STC selection controller  32018  shown in FIG. 39 during seamless reproduction operation.  \\n     [0753] At step # 311220 , the STC offset (offset value STCof) is calculated, and the procedure moves to step # 311221 .  \\n     [0754] As described above, the STC offset value STCof is calculated by subtracting the Initial Video Frame Presentation Start Time VOB V_SPTM_reg value of the next VOB to be reproduced from the Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time VOB_V_EPTM_reg (see FIG. 55) of the VOB reproduced first. Thus, the total reproduction time of the VOB reproduced first is calculated as the offset value STCof of the VOB reproduced next.  \\n     [0755] At step # 311221  the calculated STC offset value STCof is applied to the STC regenerator  32016  to update the system clock STC. The procedure then moves to step # 311222 .  \\n     [0756] The STC regenerator  32016  updates the system clock STC by subtracting the output STCof from the STC offset calculator  32012  from the reference clock STCc output from the STC counter  32014  (STCc-STCof), and outputs the result as the reset system clock STCr.  \\n     [0757] At step # 311222  the reset system clock STCr is selectively output by the STC selection controller  32018  to the STC selector for system decoder  32026  at time T 1  (FIG. 40), i.e., at the time SCR changes from stream VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 . The procedure then moves to step # 311223 . Thereafter the reset system clock STCr is applied as the system clock STC referenced by the system decoder, and the transfer timing of VOB # 2  to the system decoder is determined by the SCR in the pack header of the pack and the STCr.  \\n     [0758] At step # 311223  the reset system clock STCr is selectively output to the STC selector for audio decoder  32024  at time T 2  (FIG. 40), i.e., at the time APTS changes from stream VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 . The procedure then moves to step # 311224 . Thereafter the reset system clock STCr is applied as the system clock STC referenced by the audio decoder, and the VOB # 2  audio output timing is determined by the APTS in the audio packet and the STCr. In other words, when the STCr matches the APTS, the audio data corresponding to that APTS is reproduced.  \\n     [0759] At step # 311224  the reset system clock STCr is selectively output to the STC selector for video decoder  32020  at time T 3  (FIG. 40), i.e., at the time VDTS changes from stream VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 . The procedure then moves to step # 311225 . Thereafter the reset system clock STCr is applied as the system clock STC referenced by the video decoder, and the VOB # 2  video decode timing is determined by the VDTS in the video packet and the STCr. In other words, when the STCr matches the VDTS, the video data corresponding to that VDTS is decoded.  \\n     [0760] At step # 311225  the reset system clock STCr is selectively output to the STC selector for sub-picture decoder  32022  at time T 4  (FIG. 40), i.e., at the time VPTS changes from stream VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 . The procedure then moves to step # 311226 . Thereafter the reset system clock STCr is applied as the system clock STC referenced by the sub-picture decoder, and the VOB # 2  sub-picture presentation timing is determined by the presentation time stamp PTS in the sub-picture packet and the STCr.  \\n     [0761] In other words, when the STCr matches the PTS, the sub-picture data corresponding to that PTS is reproduced. Note that the process from sub-picture decoding to presentation is accomplished instantaneously. As a result, the system clock STC value referenced by the sub-picture decoder changes at the same timing at which the video playback starting time information VPTS changes from VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 .  \\n     [0762] At step # 311226  the STCr is reset to the STC initializer  32010 . The STC initializer  32010  thus supplies this updated clock to the STC counter  32014 , which operates using this reset system clock STCr value as the initial value. The procedure then moves to step # 311227 .  \\n     [0763] At step # 311227  all of the STC selectors, i.e., STC selector for video decoder  32020 , STC selector for sub-picture decoder  32022 , STC selector for audio decoder  32024 , and STC selector for system decoder  32026 , output the reference clock STCc.  \\n     [0764] Thereafter, the system clock STC referenced by the video decoder, sub-picture decoder, audio decoder, and system decoder is the reference clock STCc output from the STC counter  32014 .  \\n     [0765] The process from step # 311226  to step # 311227  must only be accomplished by the time the system clock reference SCR changes from the VOB # 2  SCR to the first SCR in the VOB following VOB # 2 , i.e., by time T 1  at which the change to the next VOB is accomplished.  \\n     [0766] Note that the STC switching time T 1  can also be obtained by detecting the change in the Initial Video Frame Presentation Start Time VOB_V_SPTM or the Final Video Frame Presentation Termination Time VOB_V_EPTM in the navigation pack NV, and extracting the SCR in the pack immediately before the change. Note that the same VOB_V_SPTM and VOB_V_EPTM values are recorded to all navigation packs NV in the same VOB. As a result, when either of these values changes, the VOB has also changed, and by monitoring a change in either of these values, it is possible to know that the VOB has changed.  \\n     [0767] T 1  can be obtained by adding the pack transfer time to the SCR value in the pack immediately before the VOB changed. Note that the pack transfer time is a constant value.  \\n     [0768] STC switching times T 2  and T 3  can also be calculated from the APTS, VDTS, and VPTS values extracted immediately before the VOB_V_SPTM or VOB_V_EPTM value in the navigation pack NV changes.  \\n     [0769] T 2  is calculated by extracting the APTS from the audio packet immediately before the VOB changes, and adding the audio reproduction time contained in the audio packet of the corresponding APTS value. Note that the audio reproduction time contained in the audio packet can be calculated from the audio bit rate and the packet data size.  \\n     [0770] T 3  can be obtained by extracting the VDTS from the video packet containing the corresponding VDTS immediately before the VOB changes. T 3  is thus obtained as the time defined by the VDTS.  \\n     [0771] T 4  is equivalent to the VOB_V_EPTM value, which is therefore used.  \\n     [0772] Synchronization Controller: Embodiment 2  \\n     [0773] A second embodiment of the synchronizer  2900  shown in FIG. 26 is described according to the present invention with reference to FIG. 41 below. As shown in FIG. 41, the synchronizer  2900  comprises a system clock STC generator  32030 , PTS/DTS extractor  32031 , synchronization controller  32032 , video decoder synchronizer  32033 , sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034 , audio decoder synchronizer  32035 , and system decoder synchronizer  32036 .  \\n     [0774] The STC generator  32030  generates the system clock for each decoder, and supplies the synchronization system clock STC to the video decoder synchronizer  32033 , sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034 , audio decoder synchronizer  32035 , and system decoder synchronizer  32036 . The STC generator  32030  is a counter that operates at the system clock. The SCR from the first pack in the first VOB in the program chain PGC is set as the initial counter value, and is thereafter-incremented based on the system clock. Note that the initial STC counter value may be reset to the APTS or VPTS value.  \\n     [0775] Both the audio and video outputs are reproduced synchronized to the respective output clocks. It is therefore possible for synchronization to be disrupted by the accumulated error in STC, audio output clock, and video output clock precision. When this accumulated error becomes great, the respective decoder buffers may be destroyed (by a data underflow or overflow state). Therefore, by periodically resetting the system clock STC to the APTS synchronized to the audio output clock, for example, APTS-STC error accumulation can be prevented, and the audio can be reproduced without interruption. In this case, video synchronization is controlled by skipping or freezing video output.  \\n     [0776] This type of synchronization control is defined as Audio Master synchronization control.  \\n     [0777] On the other hand, by periodically resetting the system clock STC to the VPTS synchronized to the video output clock, VPTS-STC error accumulation can be prevented, and the video can be seamlessly reproduced. In this case, audio synchronization is controlled by skipping or pausing audio output.  \\n     [0778] This type of synchronization control is defined as Video Master synchronization control.  \\n     [0779] In the following description of synchronization control, an ON synchronization mode refers to STC-referenced synchronization, control, either Audio or Video Master. An OFF synchronization mode is when STC-referenced synchronization control is not applied. In an OFF synchronization mode the audio and video decoders sequentially output the audio and video at a defined frame frequency based on the respective internal reference clocks without referencing the time stamp values from the streams, and no timing control is applied to synchronize the audio and video.  \\n     [0780] The PTS/DTS extractor  32031  extracts the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS from the synchronization control data St 81 , and supplies the PTS and DTS to the respective decoder synchronizers.  \\n     [0781] The synchronization controller  32032  generates the synchronization control signal specifying an ON or OFF synchronization mode for each of the decoder synchronizers. This synchronization controller  32032  is described in detail below with reference to FIG. 42.  \\n     [0782] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an ON synchronization mode, the video decoder synchronizer  32033  generates the video stream decoding start signal St 89  based on the STC from the STC generator  32030  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting video decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  32031 . More specifically, the video decoder synchronizer  32033  generates the video stream decoding start signal St 89  when the STC and DTS match.  \\n     [0783] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an OFF synchronization mode, the video decoder synchronizer  32033  constantly outputs the video stream decoding start signal St 89 . Thus, the video decoder operates independently of external control, and is controlled by internal state information.  \\n     [0784] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an ON synchronization mode, the sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034  generates the sub-picture stream decoding start signal St 91  based on the STC from the STC generator  32030  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting sub-picture decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  32031 . More specifically, the sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034  generates the sub-picture stream decoding start signal St 91  when the STC and DTS match.  \\n     [0785] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an OFF synchronization mode, the sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034  constantly outputs the sub-picture stream decoding start signal St 91 . Thus, the sub-picture decoder operates independently of external control, and is controlled by internal state information.  \\n     [0786] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an ON synchronization mode, the audio decoder synchronizer  32035  generates the audio stream decoding start signal St 93  based on the STC from the STC generator  32030  and the decoding time stamp DTS for starting audio decoding supplied from the PTS/DTS extractor  32031 . More specifically, the audio decoder synchronizer  32035  generates the audio stream decoding start signal St 93  when the STC and DTS match.  \\n     [0787] If the synchronization control signal from the synchronization controller  32032  specifies an OFF synchronization mode, the audio decoder synchronizer  32035  constantly outputs the audio stream decoding start signal St 93 . Thus, the audio decoder operates independently of external control, and is controlled by internal state information.  \\n     [0788] The system decoder synchronizer  32036  outputs the STC from the STC generator  32030  as the system clock St 79 . The system clock St 79  is used to control pack transfers from the stream buffers to the system decoder. In other words, if the STC value matches the SCR value in the pack, the pack data is transferred from the stream buffer to the system decoder.  \\n     [0789] The structure and operation of the synchronization controller  32032  are described below with reference to FIG. 42 and FIG. 43.  \\n     [0790] The structure of the synchronization controller  32032  is shown in FIG. 42. As shown in the figure, the synchronization controller  32032  comprises an SCR change detector  32040 , APTS changing time detector  32041 , VPTS changing time detector  32042 , and synchronization mode selector  32043 .  \\n     [0791] The SCR change detector  32040  generates and supplies to the synchronization mode selector  32043  an ACTIVE SCR change detection signal if the SCR value in the pack header in the synchronization control data St 81  changes to 0. By thus setting the SCR to 0 in the first pack of the VOB reproduced later when seamlessly connecting and reproducing two VOB, the VOB break point can be easily detected. Note that the SCR is not set to 0 when an originally contiguous VOB is divided in two, i.e., when the SCR is contiguous between two VOB.  \\n     [0792] Note, further, that while a 0 value is described here, any value whereby the beginning and end of each VOB can be easily determined can be used.  \\n     [0793] In the case of parental lock control, for example, when a single stream, e.g., VOB # 2 , is reconnected to one of plural possible scenes, e.g., VOB # 1 , from the multi-scene period enabling parental lock control, each of the VOB in the multi-scene period may have a different reproduction time, and it is not possible to assign the first SCR value in each possible VOB # 2  to account for all possible connections. A seamless can be achieved in such cases, however, by setting the SCR of the first pack in VOB # 2  to 0.  \\n     [0794] The APTS changing time detector  32041  compares the APTS in the synchronization control data St 81  when the VOB changes with the STC counter value supplied from the STC generator  32030  shown in FIG. 41. When the STC counter exceeds the APTS, the APTS changing time detector  32041  generates and inputs to the synchronization mode selector  32043  an ACTIVE APTS change time detection signal.  \\n     [0795] Note that the method of detecting the APTS when the VOB changes is described below with reference to FIG. 43.  \\n     [0796] The VPTS changing time detector  32042  compares the VPTS in the synchronization control data St 81  when the VOB changes with the STC counter value supplied from the STC generator  32030 . When the STC counter exceeds the VPTS, the VPTS changing time detector  32042  generates and inputs to the synchronization mode selector  32043  an ACTIVE VPTS change time detection signal.  \\n     [0797] Note that the method of detecting the VPTS when the VOB changes is described below with reference to FIG. 43.  \\n     [0798] Based on the SCR change detection signal from the SCR change detector  32040 , the APTS change time detection signal from the APTS changing time detector  32041 , and the VPTS change time detection signal from the VPTS changing time detector  32042 , the synchronization mode selector  32043  generates the synchronization mode selection signals, and outputs to the video decoder synchronizer  32033 , sub-picture decoder synchronizer  32034 , audio decoder synchronizer  32035 , and system decoder synchronizer  32036 . The STC update signal STCs is also output to the STC generator  32030 .  \\n     [0799] The respective decoder synchronizers control synchronization based on the system clock STC if an ON synchronization mode is specified. If an OFF synchronization mode is specified, the STC is not used for synchronization control as described above.  \\n     [0800] The operation of the synchronization mode selector  32043  is described next with reference to FIG. 43.  \\n     [0801] At step # 320430  the STC update signal STCs is generated and output to the STC generator  32030 , and the procedure moves to step # 320431 . If the STC update signal STCs is ACTIVE, the STC generator  32030  sets a new SCR from the synchronization control data St 81  as the initial value, and updates the STC.  \\n     [0802] At step # 320431  the synchronization mode selector  32043  outputs a synchronization mode selection signal specifying an ON synchronization mode to the decoder synchronizers  32033 ,  32034 ,  32035 , and  32036 . The procedure then moves to step # 320432 .  \\n     [0803] At step # 320432  the procedure moves to step # 320433  if the SCR change detector  32040  detects that the SCR has changed. If an SCR change is not detected, this step is repeated until an SCR change is detected. As a result, an ON synchronization mode continues to be output to the decoder synchronizers as long as this step executes.  \\n     [0804] At step # 320433  the synchronization mode selector  32043  outputs a synchronization mode selection signal specifying an OFF synchronization mode to the decoder synchronizers  32033 ,  32034 ,  32035 , and  32036 . The procedure then moves to step # 320434 . This step thus means that the synchronization mode is OFF from the time T 1  the VOB changed during pack transfer.  \\n     [0805] If both the APTS changing time detector  32041  and VPTS changing time detector  32042  detect a changed time at step # 320434 , control loops back to step # 320430 , and the synchronization mode is set ON again at step # 320431 . However, if a changed time is not detected step # 320434  repeats until both the APT and VPTS are detected to change. This step thus means that the decoder synchronizers continue operating in an OFF synchronization mode.  \\n     [0806] Synchronization control at the start of normal reproduction, i.e., at a VOB start without contiguous reproduction from a preceding VOB, is described next with reference to FIG. 44.  \\n     [0807]FIG. 44 shows the relationship between the system clock reference SCR indicating the time a VOB is input to the system decoder data, the audio playback starting time information APTS, the decoder reference clock STC, and the video playback starting time VPTS, referenced to time shown on the horizontal axis with the values expressed in terms of the presentation start time PST on the vertical axis.  \\n     [0808] The point at which the first SCR in the VOB is 0 is point A. If the first SCR is not 0, e.g., if normal reproduction is resumed from the middle of a VOB after a special reproduction mode, the control procedure is the same. The times between input and output of the audio data and video data, respectively, to and from the system decoder are expressed as DTad and DTvd. Because DTad&lt;DTvd, and data is recorded at the VOB beginning referenced to the time it is reproduced, only video data is present at point C at the VOB start, and the audio data is recorded at point D after a delay of DTvd-DTad.  \\n     [0809] Synchronization is controlled at this point as described below. Video and audio output is first stopped, the SCR value from the pack at point A is set to the STC generator  32030 , and the STC generator  32030  operates an internal counter at the system clock and outputs the system clock STC. Transfer of the first pack in the VOB to the system decoder  2500  starts at the same time. The following packs are transferred at the SCR recorded in the pack header of each pack referenced to the system clock STC produced by the STC generator  32030 .  \\n     [0810] The first video data is then decoded, and video output starts at point F when the STC output from the STC generator  32030  matches the first VPTS value.  \\n     [0811] Audio output is similarly controlled: the first audio data is decoded, and audio output starts at point E, the moment when the STC output from the STC generator  32030  matches the first APTS value.  \\n     [0812] After reproduction of the start of the VOB thus begins, the audio APTS value is periodically set to the STC generator  32030  to control synchronization under Audio Master or Video Master control.  \\n     [0813] The method of synchronizing seamless reproduction of two VOB is described next. The detection method of the SCR change detector  32040 , APTS changing time detector  32041 , and VPTS changing time detector  32042  in FIG. 42 is particularly described with reference to FIG. 45.  \\n     [0814]FIG. 45 shows the relationship between the recording positions and values of SCR, APTS, and VPTS when VOB # 1  and VOB # 2  are seamlessly reproduced. Why the synchronization mode of the decoder synchronizers must be switched ON and OFF to achieve seamless reproduction is described first.  \\n     [0815] Point G is the time at which the pack being transferred changes from VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 , H is the time the audio output changes, and I is the time the video output changes. Because the audio output and video output thus change at different times, synchronization control cannot be achieved using a single system clock STC. It is therefore necessary to prevent synchronization control using the STC during the period from when the SCR changes at time G to when both the APTS and VPTS have changed at time I. After both the APTS and VPTS have changed at time I, synchronization control using the STC is again possible and necessary.  \\n     [0816] The method of detecting the timing at which synchronization control is stopped, i.e., when the synchronization mode is turned OFF, is described next.  \\n     [0817] The timing at which the synchronization mode is turned OFF is obtained from the SCR time chart in FIG. 45. VOB # 1  is being output to the system decoder while the SCR value increases, and SCR becomes 0 only at time G, i.e., when VOB # 1  transfer stops and VOB # 2  transfer begins. Therefore, by detecting the time at which the SCR value becomes 0, it is known that VOB # 2  is being input to the system decoder, and the synchronization mode is therefore set OFF at this time Tg.  \\n     [0818] It is also possible to detect that the SCR is 0 when the value is written to the stream buffer. The synchronization mode can also be set OFF when a 0 SCR value is detected written to the stream buffer.  \\n     [0819] The timing at which synchronization control begins, i.e., when the synchronization mode is turned from OFF to ON, is described next.  \\n     [0820] To start synchronization control it is necessary to know when both the audio and video output have switched from VOB # 1  to VOB # 2 . The moment when the audio output changes to VOB # 2  can be known by detecting the point H at which the APTS value stops increasing. Likewise, the moment when the video output changes to VOB # 2  can be known by detecting the point I at which the VPTS value stops increasing. After both points H and I have appeared, the synchronization mode is immediately set ON at time Ti.  \\n     [0821] The timing at which the synchronization mode is set OFF can also be delayed to a time between time Tg and time Ti, rather than at time Tg when an SCR change is detected. By setting the synchronization mode OFF at time Th, i.e., the time at which a change in APTS or VPTS is detected, between Tg and Ti, the duration of the OFF synchronization mode can be shortened.  \\n     [0822] However, when the timing is based on detecting whether both APTS and VPTS values continue increasing, it is clear that both APTS and VPTS values must decrease when VOB are connected. In other words, the last APTS and VPTS values in a VOB must be greater than the maximum initial APTS and VPTS values in a VOB.  \\n     [0823] The maximum initial (DTad and DTvd) APTS and VPTS values are defined as follows.  \\n     [0824] The initial APTS and VPTS values are the sums of the video data and audio data storage times in the video and audio buffers, and the video reordering time (in MPEG. video, the picture decode order and presentation order are not necessarily the same, and presentation is delayed a maximum one picture from the decoder). Therefore, the sum of the time required for the video buffer and audio buffer to fill, and the presentation delay (1 frame period) from video reordering, determines the maximum initial values for APTS and VPTS.  \\n     [0825] As a result, the last APTS and VPTS values in a VOB are always assigned to exceed these maximum initial values when the VOB are produced.  \\n     [0826] While it is possible to control the timing at which the synchronization mode is turned ON following VOB connection by detecting whether both APTS and VPTS values continue increasing, it is also possible to achieve the same synchronization control by detecting the time at which the APTS value drops below an APTS threshold value, and the VPTS value drops below an VPTS threshold value.  \\n     [0827] These APTS and VPTS threshold values can be calculated by using values equal to the maximum initial APTS and VPTS values of the VOB as the threshold values, and calculating them as described above.  \\n     [0828] By applying ON/OFF synchronization mode control as described above, seamless reproduction that does not disturb the playback condition can be achieved in VOB connections.  \\n     [0829] Note that various methods can be used in the reproduction apparatus for audio and video synchronization control in the second embodiment described above. The most common of these methods (1) is to reset the system clock STC to the APTS value every few seconds, determine whether the VPTS value is fast or slow referenced to the system clock STC, and freeze or skip video output as necessary. This is the so-called Audio Master method described above.  \\n     [0830] Alternatively, it is also possible (2) to reset the system clock STC to the VPTS value every few seconds, determine whether the APTS value is fast or slow referenced to the system clock STC, and freeze or skip audio output as necessary. This is the so-called Video Master method described above.  \\n     [0831] Another method (3) is to directly compare the APTS and VPTS values, and use either the APTS or VPTS value for reference.  \\n     [0832] Regardless of which method is used for ON/OFF synchronization mode control, however, the same effect can be achieved.  \\n     [0833] As described above, two methods are used for audio-video synchronization according to the present embodiment, Audio Master and Video Master synchronization control. For Audio Master synchronization control the system clock STC is periodically reset to the APTS value, whether the VPTS value is earlier or later is determined referenced to the reset system clock STC, and the video presentation is frozen or skipped as necessary for synchronization. For Video Master synchronization control the system clock STC is periodically reset to the VPTS value, whether the APTS value is earlier or later is determined referenced to the reset system clock STC, and the audio presentation is paused or skipped as necessary for synchronization. It is also possible to directly compare the APTS and VPTS values, and control synchronization referenced to either the APTS or VPTS value. Regardless of which method is used for AV synchronization control, however, the same effects can be obtained.  \\n     [0834] Furthermore, while the above embodiments have been described using an initial VOB SCR value of 0, a value other than 0 can be used and the same control achieved by adding the first SCR value as an offset value to the APTS and VPTS values.  \\n     [0835] It is also possible in the second embodiment above to read the STC discontinuity flag STCDCF_reg, which specifies whether the next cell reproduced needs the STC to be reset. If the register reads STC_NRESET, the synchronization mode is constantly ON; if STC_RESET is stored, ON/OFF synchronization mode control can be applied.  \\n     [0836] It is thus possible to decode the data transferred to the stream buffer  2400  while synchronizing the operation of the various decoders.  \\n     [0837] It is therefore possible by means of the present invention thus described to maintain synchronization between the audio and video data, and seamlessly connect and reproduce two VOB during reproduction from a multi-scene period even when there is no continuity between the system clock reference SCR and presentation time stamp PTS values used for synchronization control of the VOB to be contiguously reproduced.  \\n     [0838] Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Field of the Invention </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0002\" num=\"0002\">[0002] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for seamlessly reproducing a bitstream having non-sequential system clock data therein and, more specifically, to a bitstream for use in an authoring system for variously processing a data bitstream comprising the video data, audio data, and sub-picture data constituting each of plural program titles containing related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data content to generate a bitstream from which a new title containing the content desired by the user can be reproduced, and efficiently recording and reproducing said generated bitstream using a particular recording medium. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0003\" num=\"0003\">[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] Authoring systems used to produce program titles comprising related video data, audio data, and sub-picture data by digitally processing, for example, multimedia data comprising video, audio, and sub-picture data recorded to laser disk or video CD formats are currently available. Systems using Video-Cds in particular are able to record video data to a CD format disk, which was originally designed with an approximately 600 MB recording capacity for storing digital audio data only, by using such high efficiency video compression techniques as MPEG. As a result of the increased effective recording capacity achieved using data compression techniques, karaoke titles and other conventional laser disk applications are gradually being transferred to the video CD format. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] Users today expect both sophisticated title content and high reproduction quality. To meet these expectations, each title must be composed from bitstreams with an increasingly deep hierarchical structure. The data size of multimedia titles written with bitstreams having such deep hierarchical structures, however, is ten or more times greater than the data size of less complex titles. The need to edit small image (title) details also makes it necessary to process and control the bitstream using low order hierarchical data units. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] It is therefore necessary to develop and prove a bitstream structure and an advanced digital processing method including both recording and reproduction capabilities whereby a large volume, multiple level hierarchical digital bitstream can be efficiently controlled at each level of the hierarchy. Also needed are an apparatus for executing this digital processing method, and a recording media to which the bitstream digitally processed by said apparatus can be efficiently recorded for storage and from which said recorded information can be quickly reproduced. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] Means of increasing the storage capacity of conventional optical disks have been widely researched to address the recording medium aspect of this problem. One way to increase the storage capacity of the optical disk is to reduce the spot diameter D of the optical (laser) beam. If the wavelength of the laser beam is 1 and the aperture of the objective lens is NA, then the spot diameter D is proportional to 1/NA, and the storage capacity can be efficiently improved by decreasing 1 and increasing NA. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008] As described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,581, however, coma caused by a relative tilt between the disk surface and the optical axis of the laser beam (hereafter \u201ctilt\u201d) increases when a large aperture (high NA) lens is used. To prevent tilt-induced coma, the transparent substrate must be made very thin. The problem is that the mechanical strength of the disk is low when the transparent substrate is very thin. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] MPEG1, the conventional method of recording and reproducing video, audio, and graphic signal data, has also been replaced by the more robust MPEG2 method, which can transfer large data volumes at a higher rate. It should be noted that the compression method and data format of the MPEG2 standard differ somewhat from those of MPEG1. The specific content of and differences between MPEG1 and MPEG2 are described in detail in the ISO-11172 and ISO-13818 MPEG standards, and further description thereof is omitted below. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010] Note, however, that while the structure of the encoded video stream is defined in the MPEG2 specification, the hierarchical structure of the system stream and the method of processing lower hierarchical levels are not defined. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011] As described above, it is therefore not possible in a conventional authoring system to process a large data stream containing sufficient information to satisfy many different user requirements. Moreover, even if such a processing method were available, the processed data recorded thereto cannot be repeatedly used to reduce data redundancy because there is no large capacity recording medium currently available that can efficiently record and reproduce high volume bitstreams such as described above. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012] More specifically, particular significant hardware and software requirements must be satisfied in order to process a bitstream using a data unit smaller than the title. These specific hardware requirements include significantly increasing the storage capacity of the recording medium and increasing the speed of digital processing; software requirements include inventing an advanced digital processing method including a sophisticated data structure. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013] Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an effective authoring system for controlling a multimedia data bitstream with advanced hardware and software requirements using a data unit smaller than the title to better address advanced user requirements. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0014\" num=\"0014\">[0014] To share data between plural titles and thereby efficiently utilize optical disk capacity, multi-scene control whereby scene data common to plural titles and the desired scenes on the same time-base from within multi-scene periods containing plural scenes unique to particular reproduction paths can be freely selected and reproduced is desirable. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0015\" num=\"0015\">[0015] However, when plural scenes unique to a reproduction path within the multi-scene period are arranged on the same time-base, the scene data must be contiguous. Unselected multi-scene data is therefore unavoidably inserted between the selected common scene data and the selected multi-scene data. The problem this creates when reproducing multi-scene data is that reproduction is interrupted by this unselected scene data. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0016\" num=\"0016\">[0016] In other words, except when a VOB, which is normally a single-stream title editing unit, is divided into discrete streams, seamless reproduction cannot be achieved by simply connecting and reproducing individual VOB. This is because while the reproduction of video, audio, and sub-picture streams forming each VOB must be synchronized, the means for achieving this synchronization is enclosed in each VOB.

Referenced to a motion picture (movie), one title may correspond to the content of an entire movie, or to just one scene within said movie. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0099\" num=\"0099\">[0099] A video title set (VTS) comprises the bitstream data containing the information for a specific number of titles. More specifically, each VTS comprises the video, audio, and other reproduction data representing the content of each title in the set, and control data for controlling the content data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0100\" num=\"0100\">[0100] The video zone VZ is the video data unit processed by the authoring system, and comprises a specific number of video title sets. More specifically, each video zone is a linear sequence of K+1 video title sets numbered VTS #<b>0</b>-VTS #K where K is an integer value of zero or greater. One video title set, preferably the first video title set VTS #<b>0</b>, is used as the video manager describing the content information of the titles contained in each video title set. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0101\" num=\"0101\">[0101] The multimedia bitstream MBS is the largest control unit of the multimedia data bitstream handled by the authoring system of the present invention, and comprises plural video zones VZ. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0102\" num=\"0102\">[0102] Authoring Encoder EC </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0103\" num=\"0103\">[0103] A preferred embodiment of the authoring encoder EC according to the present invention for generating a new multimedia bitstream MBS by re-encoding the original multimedia bitstream MBS according to the scenario desired by the user is shown in FIG. 2. Note that the original multimedia bitstream MBS comprises a video stream St<b>1</b> containing the video information, a sub-picture stream St<b>3</b> containing caption text and other auxiliary video information, and the audio stream St<b>5</b> containing the audio information. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0104\" num=\"0104\">[0104] The video and audio streams are the bitstreams containing the video and audio information obtained from the source within a particular period of time. The sub-picture stream is a bitstream containing momentary video information relevant to a particular scene. The sub-picture data encoded to a single scene may be captured to video memory and displayed continuously from the video memory for plural scenes as may be necessary. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0105\" num=\"0105\">[0105] When this multimedia source data St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b> is obtained from a live broadcast, the video and audio signals are supplied in real-time from a video camera or other imaging source; when the multimedia source data is reproduced from a video tape or other recording medium, the audio and video signals are not real-time signals. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0106\" num=\"0106\">[0106] While the multimedia source stream is shown in FIG. 2 as comprising these three source signals, this is for convenience only, and it should be noted that the multimedia source stream may contain more than three types of source signals, and may contain source data for different titles. Multimedia source data with audio, video, and sub-picture data for plural titles are referred to below as multi-title streams. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0107\" num=\"0107\">[0107] As shown in FIG. 2, the authoring encoder EC comprises a scenario editor <b>100</b>, encoding system controller <b>200</b>, video encoder <b>300</b>, video stream buffer <b>400</b>, sub-picture encoder <b>500</b>, sub-picture stream buffer <b>600</b>, audio encoder <b>700</b>, audio stream buffer <b>800</b>, system encoder <b>900</b>, video zone formatter <b>1300</b>, recorder <b>1200</b>, and recording medium M. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0108\" num=\"0108\">[0108] The video zone formatter <b>1300</b> comprises video object (VOB) buffer <b>1000</b>, formatter <b>1100</b>, and volume and file structure formatter <b>1400</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0109\" num=\"0109\">[0109] The bitstream encoded by the authoring encoder EC of the present embodiment is recorded by way of example only to an optical disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0110\" num=\"0110\">[0110] The scenario editor <b>100</b> of the authoring encoder EC outputs the scenario data, i.e., the user-defined editing instructions. The scenario data controls editing the corresponding parts of the multimedia bitstream MBS according to the user&#39;s manipulation of the video, sub-picture, and audio components of the original multimedia title. This scenario editor <b>100</b> preferably comprises a display, speaker(s), keyboard, CPU, and source stream buffer. The scenario editor <b>100</b> is connected to an external multimedia bitstream source from which the multimedia source data St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b> are supplied. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0111\" num=\"0111\">[0111] The user is thus able to reproduce the video and audio components of the multimedia source data using the display and speaker to confirm the content of the generated title. The user is then able to edit the title content according to the desired scenario using the keyboard, mouse, and other command input devices while confirming the content of the title on the display and speakers. The result of this multimedia data manipulation is the scenario data St<b>7</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0112\" num=\"0112\">[0112] The scenario data St<b>7</b> is basically a set of instructions describing what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user. Based on the instructions received through the keyboard or other control device, the CPU codes the position, length, and the relative time-based positions of the edited parts of the-respective multimedia source data streams St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b> to generate the scenario data St<b>7</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0113\" num=\"0113\">[0113] The source stream buffer has a specific capacity, and is used to delay the multimedia source data streams St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b> a known time Td and then output streams St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0114\" num=\"0114\">[0114] This delay is required for synchronization with the editor encoding process. More specifically, when data encoding and user generation of scenario data St<b>7</b> are executed simultaneously, i.e., when encoding immediately follows editing, time Td is required to determine the content of the multimedia source data editing process based on the scenario data St<b>7</b> as will be described further below. As a result, the multimedia source data must be delayed by time Td to synchronize the editing process during the actual encoding operation. Because this delay time Td is limited to the time required to synchronize the operation of the various system components in the case of sequential editing as described above, the source stream buffer is normally achieved by means of a high speed storage medium such as semiconductor memory. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0115\" num=\"0115\">[0115] During batch editing in which all multimedia source data is encoded at once (\u201cbatch encoded\u201d) after scenario data St<b>7</b> is generated for the complete title, delay time Td must be long enough to process the complete title or longer. In this case, the source stream buffer may be a low speed, high capacity storage medium such as video tape, magnetic disk or optical disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0116\" num=\"0116\">[0116] The structure (type) of media used for the source stream buffer may therefore be determined according to the delay time Td required and the allowable manufacturing cost. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0117\" num=\"0117\">[0117] The encoding system controller <b>200</b> is connected to the scenario editor <b>100</b> and receives the scenario data St<b>7</b> therefrom. Based on the time-base position and length information of the edit segment contained in the scenario data St<b>7</b>, the encoding system controller <b>200</b> generates the encoding parameter signals St<b>9</b>, St<b>11</b>, and St<b>13</b> for encoding the edit segment of the multimedia source data. The encoding signals St<b>9</b>, St<b>11</b>, and St<b>13</b> supply the parameters used for video, sub-picture, and audio encoding, including the encoding start and end timing. Note that multimedia source data St<b>1</b>, St<b>3</b>, and St<b>5</b> are output after delay time Td by the source stream buffer, and are therefore synchronized to encoding parameter signals St<b>9</b>, St<b>11</b>, and St<b>13</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0118\" num=\"0118\">[0118] More specifically, encoding parameter signal St<b>9</b> is the video encoding signal specifying the encoding timing of video stream St<b>1</b> to extract the encoding segment from the video stream St<b>1</b> and generate the video encoding unit. Encoding parameter signal St<b>11</b> is likewise the sub-picture stream encoding signal used to generate the sub-picture encoding unit by specifying the encoding timing for sub-picture stream St<b>3</b>.

A backing layer BL<b>1</b> is also provided on the back of data recording surface RS<b>1</b>. The side of the disk on which protective layer PL<b>1</b> is provided is therefore referred to below as side SA (commonly \u201cside A\u201d), and the opposite side (on which the backing layer BL<b>1</b> is provided) is referred to as side SB (\u201cside B\u201d). Note that digital video disk recording media having a single data recording surface RS<b>1</b> on only one side such as this DVD recording medium RC<b>1</b> is commonly called a single-sided single layer disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0160\" num=\"0160\">[0160] A detailed illustration of area C<b>1</b> in FIG. 4 is shown in FIG. 5. Note that the data recording surface RS<b>1</b> is formed by applying a metallic thin film or other reflective coating as a data layer <b>4109</b> on a first transparent layer <b>4108</b> having a particular thickness T<b>1</b>. This first transparent layer <b>4108</b> also functions as the protective layer PL<b>1</b>. A second transparent substrate <b>4111</b> of a thickness T<b>2</b> functions as the backing layer BL<b>1</b>, and is bonded to the first transparent layer <b>4108</b> by means of an adhesive layer <b>4110</b> disposed therebetween. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0161\" num=\"0161\">[0161] A printing layer <b>4112</b> for printing a disk label may also be disposed on the second transparent substrate <b>4111</b> as necessary. The printing layer <b>4112</b> does not usually cover the entire surface area of the second transparent substrate <b>4111</b> (backing layer BL<b>1</b>), but only the area needed to print the text and graphics of the disk label. The area of second transparent substrate <b>4111</b> to which the printing layer <b>4112</b> is not formed may be left exposed. Light reflected from the data layer <b>4109</b> (metallic thin film) forming the data recording surface RS<b>1</b> can therefore be directly observed where the label is not printed when the digital video disk is viewed from side SB. As a result, the background looks like a silver-white over which the printed text and graphics float when the metallic thin film is an aluminum thin film, for example. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0162\" num=\"0162\">[0162] Note that it is only necessary to provide the printing layer <b>4112</b> where needed for printing, and it is not necessary to provide the printing layer <b>4112</b> over the entire surface of the backing layer BL<b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0163\" num=\"0163\">[0163] A detailed illustration of area C<b>2</b> in FIG. 5 is shown in FIG. 6. Pits and lands are molded to the common contact surface between the first transparent layer <b>4108</b> and the data layer <b>4109</b> on side SA from which data is read by emitting a laser beam LS, and data is recorded by varying the lengths of the pits and lands (i.e., the length of the intervals between the pits). More specifically, the pit and land configuration formed on the first transparent layer <b>4108</b> is transferred to the data layer <b>4109</b>. The lengths of the pits and lands is shorter, and the pitch of the data tracks formed by the pit sequences is narrower, than with a conventional Compact Disc (CD). The surface recording density is therefore greatly improved. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0164\" num=\"0164\">[0164] Side SA of the first transparent layer <b>4108</b> on which data pits are not formed is a flat surface. The second transparent substrate <b>4111</b> is for reinforcement, and is a transparent panel made from the same material as the first transparent layer <b>4108</b> with both sides flat. Thicknesses T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> are preferably equal and commonly approximately 0.6 mm, but the invention shall not be so limited. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0165\" num=\"0165\">[0165] As with a CD, information is read by irradiating the surface with a laser beam LS and detecting the change in the reflectivity of the light spot. Because the objective lens aperture NA can be large and the wavelength <b>1</b> of the light beam small in a digital video disk system, the diameter of the light spot Ls used can be reduced to approximately 1/1.6 the light spot needed to read a CD. Note that this means the resolution of the laser beam LS in the DVD system is approximately 1.6 times the resolution of a conventional CD system. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0166\" num=\"0166\">[0166] The optical system used to read data from the digital video disk uses a short 650 nm wavelength red semiconductor laser and an-objective lens with a 0.6 mm aperture NA. By thus also reducing the thickness T of the transparent panels to 0.6 mm, more than 5 GB of data can be stored to one side of a 120 mm diameter optical disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0167\" num=\"0167\">[0167] It is therefore possible to store motion picture (video) images having an extremely large per unit data size to a digital video disk system disk without losing image quality because the storage capacity of a single-sided, single-layer recording medium RC<b>1</b> with one data recording surface RS<b>1</b> as thus described is nearly ten times the storage capacity of a conventional CD. As a result, while the video presentation time of a conventional CD system is approximately 74 minutes if image quality is sacrificed, high quality video images with a video presentation time exceeding two hours can be recorded to a DVD. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0168\" num=\"0168\">[0168] The digital video disk is therefore well-suited as a recording medium for video images. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0169\" num=\"0169\">[0169] A digital video disk recording medium with plural recording surfaces RS as described above is shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. The DVD recording medium RC<b>2</b> shown in FIG. 7 comprises two recording surfaces, i.e., first recording surface RS<b>1</b> and semi-transparent second recording surface RS<b>2</b>, on the same side, i.e. side SA, of the disk. Data can be simultaneously recorded or reproduced from these two recording surfaces by using different laser beams LS<b>1</b> and LS<b>2</b> for the first recording surface RS<b>1</b> and the second recording surface RS<b>2</b>. It is also possible to read/write both recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> using only one of the laser beams LS<b>1</b> or LS<b>2</b>. Note that recording media thus comprised are called \u201csingle-side, dual-layer disks.\u201d</p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0170\" num=\"0170\">[0170] It should also be noted that while two recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> are provided in this example, it is also possible to produce digital video disk recording media having more than two recording surfaces RS. Disks thus comprised are known as \u201csingle-sided, multi-layer disks.\u201d</p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0171\" num=\"0171\">[0171] Though comprising two recording surfaces similarly to the recording media shown in FIG. 7, the DVD recording medium RC<b>3</b> shown in FIG. 8 has the recording surfaces on opposite sides of the disk, i. e., has the first data recording surface RS<b>1</b> on side SA and the second data recording surface RS<b>2</b> on side SB. It will also be obvious that while only two recording surfaces are shown on one digital video disk in this example, more than two recording surfaces may also be formed on a double-sided digital video disk. As with the recording medium shown in FIG. 7, it is also possible to provide two separate laser beams LS<b>1</b> and LS<b>2</b> for recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b>, or to read/write both recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> using a single laser beam. Note that this type of digital video disk is called a \u201cdouble-sided, dual-layer disk.\u201d It will also be obvious that a double-sided digital video disk can be comprised with two or more recording surfaces per side. This type of disk is called a \u201cdouble-sided, multi-layer disk.\u201d</p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0172\" num=\"0172\">[0172] A plan view from the laser beam LS irradiation side of the recording surface RS of the DVD recording medium RC is shown in FIG. 9 and FIG. 10. Note that a continuous spiral data recording track TR is provided from the inside circumference to the outside circumference of the DVD. The data recording track TR is divided into plural sectors each having the same known storage capacity. Note that for simplicity only the data recording track TR is shown in FIG. 9 with more than three sectors per revolution. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0173\" num=\"0173\">[0173] As shown in FIG. 9, the data recording track TR is normally formed clockwise inside to outside (see arrow DrA) from the inside end point IA at the inside circumference of disk RCA to the outside end point OA at the outside circumference of the disk with the disk RCA rotating counterclockwise RdA. This type of disk RCA is called a clockwise disk, and the recording track formed thereon is called a clockwise track TRA. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0174\" num=\"0174\">[0174] Depending upon the application, the recording track TRB may be formed clockwise from outside to inside circumference (see arrow DrB in FIG. 10) from the outside end point OB at the outside circumference of disk RCB to the inside end point IB at the inside circumference of the disk with the disk RCB rotating clockwise RdB. Because the recording track appears to wind counterclockwise when viewed from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on disks with the recording track formed in the direction of arrow DrB, these disks are referred to as counterclockwise disk RCB with counterclockwise track TRB to distinguish them from disk RCA in FIG. 9. Note that track directions DrA and DrB are the track paths along which the laser beam travels when scanning the tracks for recording and playback. Direction of disk rotation RdA in which disk RCA turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrA, and direction of disk rotation RdB in which disk RCB turns is thus opposite the direction of track path DrB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0175\" num=\"0175\">[0175] An exploded view of the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC<b>2</b> shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC<b>2</b>o in FIG. 11. Note that the recording tracks formed on the two recording surfaces run in opposite directions. Specifically, a clockwise recording track TRA as shown in FIG. 9 is formed in clockwise direction DrA on the (lower) first data recording surface RS<b>1</b>, and a counterclockwise recording track TRB formed in counterclockwise direction DrB as shown in FIG. 10 is provided on the (upper) second data recording surface RS<b>2</b>. As a result, the outside end points OA and OB of the first and second (top and bottom) tracks are at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC<b>2</b>o. Note that track paths DrA and DrB of tracks TR are also the data read/write directions to disk RC. The first and second (top and bottom) recording tracks thus wind opposite each other with this disk RC, i.e., the track paths DrA and DrB of the top and bottom recording layers are opposite track paths. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0176\" num=\"0176\">[0176] Opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disks RC<b>2</b>o rotate in direction RdA corresponding to the first recording surface RS<b>1</b> with the laser beam LS travelling along track path DrA to trace the recording track on the first recording surface RS<b>1</b>. When the laser beam LS reaches the outside end point OA, the laser beam LS can be refocused to end point OB on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b> to continue tracing the recording track from the first to the second recording surface uninterrupted. The physical distance between the recording tracks TRA and TRB on the first and second recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> can thus be instantaneously eliminated by simply adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0177\" num=\"0177\">[0177] It is therefore possible with an opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC<b>2</b> <i>o </i>to easily process the recording tracks disposed to physically discrete top and bottom recording surfaces as a single continuous recording track. It is therefore also possible in an authoring system as described above with reference to FIG. 1 to continuously record the multimedia bitstream MBS that is the largest multimedia data management unit to two discrete recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> on a single recording medium RC<b>2</b>o. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0178\" num=\"0178\">[0178] It should be noted that the tracks on recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> can be wound in the directions opposite those described above, i.e., the counterclockwise track TRB may be provided on the first recording surface RS<b>1</b> and the clockwise track TRA on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b>. In this case the direction of disk rotation is also changed to a clockwise rotation RdB, thereby enabling the two recording surfaces to be used as comprising a single continuous recording track as described above. For simplification, a further example of this type of disk is therefore neither shown nor described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0179\" num=\"0179\">[0179] It is therefore possible by thus constructing the digital video disk to record the multimedia bitstream MBS for a feature-length title to a single opposite track path type, single-sided, dual-layer disk RC<b>2</b>o. Note that this type of digital video disk medium is called a single-sided dual-layer disk with opposite track paths. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0180\" num=\"0180\">[0180] Another example of the single-sided, dual-layer DVD recording medium RC<b>2</b> shown in FIG. 7 is shown as disk RC<b>2</b>p in FIG. 12. The recording tracks formed on both first and second recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> are clockwise tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9. In this case, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC<b>2</b>p rotates counterclockwise in the direction of arrow RdA, and the direction of laser beam LS travel is the same as the direction of the track spiral, i.e., the track paths of the top and bottom recording surfaces are mutually parallel (parallel track paths). The outside end points OA of both top and bottom tracks are again preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the disk RC<b>2</b>p as described above. As also described above with disk RC<b>2</b>o shown in FIG. 11, the access point can be instantaneously shifted from outside end point OA of track TRA on the first recording surface RS<b>1</b> to the outside end point OA of track TRA on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b> by appropriately adjusting the focus of the laser beam LS at outside end point OA. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0181\" num=\"0181\">[0181] However, for the laser beam LS to continuously access the clockwise recording track TRA on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b>, the recording medium RC<b>2</b>p must be driven in the opposite direction (clockwise, opposite direction RdA). Depending-on the radial position of the laser beam LS, however, it is inefficient to change the rotational direction of the recording medium. As shown by the diagonal arrow in FIG. 12, the laser beam LS is therefore moved from the outside end point OA of the track on the first recording surface RS<b>1</b> to the inside end point IA of the track on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b> to use these physically discrete recording tracks as one logically continuous recording track. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0182\" num=\"0182\">[0182] Rather than using the recording tracks on top and bottom recording surfaces as one continuous recording track, it is also possible to use the recording tracks to record the multimedia bitstreams MBS for different titles. This type of digital video disk recording medium is called a \u201csingle-sided, dual-layer disk with parallel track paths.\u201d</p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0183\" num=\"0183\">[0183] Note that if the direction of the tracks formed on the recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> is opposite that described above, i.e., counterclockwise recording tracks TRB are formed, disk operation remains the same as that described above except for the direction of disk rotation, which is clockwise as shown by arrow RdB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0184\" num=\"0184\">[0184] Whether using clockwise or counterclockwise recording tracks, the single-sided, dual-layer disk RC<b>2</b>p with parallel track paths thus described is well-suited to storing on a single disk encyclopedia and similar multimedia bitstreams comprising multiple titles that are frequently and randomly accessed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0185\" num=\"0185\">[0185] An exploded view of the dual-sided single-layer DVD recording medium RC<b>3</b> comprising one recording surface layer RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> on each side as shown in FIG. 8 is shown as DVD recording medium RC<b>3</b> <i>s </i>in FIG. 13. Clockwise recording track TRA is provided on the one recording surface RS<b>1</b>, and a counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided on the other recording surface RS<b>2</b>. As in the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OB of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC<b>3</b> <i>s. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0186\" num=\"0186\">[0186] Note that while the recording tracks on these recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> rotate in opposite directions, the track paths are symmetrical. This type of recording medium is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths. This double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC<b>3</b> <i>s </i>rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS<b>1</b>. As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b> on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrB in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrA. Accessing both recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> using a single laser beam LS is therefore not realistic irrespective of whether access is continuous or non-continuous. In addition, a multimedia bitstream MBS is separately recorded to the recording surfaces on the first and second sides of the disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0187\" num=\"0187\">[0187] A different example of the double-sided single layer disk RC<b>3</b> shown in FIG. 8 is shown in FIG. 14 as disk RC<b>3</b> <i>a. </i>Note that this disk -comprises clockwise recording tracks TRA as shown in FIG. 9 on both recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b>. As with the preceding recording media, the outside end points OA and OA of the recording tracks on each recording surface are preferably positioned at the same radial position relative to the center axis of the DVD recording medium RC<b>3</b> <i>a. </i>Unlike the double-sided dual layer disk with symmetrical track paths RC<b>3</b> <i>s </i>described above, the tracks on these recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> are asymmetrical. This type of disk is therefore known as a double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths. This double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC<b>3</b> <i>a </i>rotates in direction RdA when reading/writing the first recording surface RS<b>1</b>. As a result, the track path on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b> on the opposite side is opposite the direction DrA in which the track winds, i.e., direction DrB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0188\" num=\"0188\">[0188] This means that if a laser beam LS is driven continuously from the inside circumference to the outside circumference on the first recording surface RS<b>1</b>, and then from the outside circumference to the inside circumference on the second recording surface RS<b>2</b>, both sides of the recording medium RC<b>3</b> <i>a </i>can be read/written without turning the disk over and without providing different laser beams for the two sides. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0189\" num=\"0189\">[0189] The track paths for recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b> are also the same with this double-sided dual layer disk with asymmetrical track paths RC<b>3</b> <i>a. </i>As a result, it is also possible to read/write both sides of the disk without providing separate-laser beams for each side if the recording medium RC<b>3</b> <i>a </i>is turned over between sides, and the read/write apparatus can therefore be constructed economically. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0190\" num=\"0190\">[0190] It should be noted that this recording medium remains functionally identical even if counterclockwise recording track TRB is provided in place of clockwise recording track TRA on both recording surfaces RS<b>1</b> and RS<b>2</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0191\" num=\"0191\">[0191] As described above, the true value of a DVD system whereby the storage capacity of the recording medium can be easily increased by using a multiple layer recording surface is realized in multimedia applications whereby plural video data units, plural audio data units, and plural graphics data units recorded to a single disk are reproduced through interactive operation by the user. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0192\" num=\"0192\">[0192] It is therefore possible to achieve one long-standing desire of software (programming) providers, specifically, to provide programming content such as a commercial movie on a single recording medium in plural versions for different language and demographic groups while retaining the image quality of the original. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0193\" num=\"0193\">[0193] Parental Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0194\" num=\"0194\">[0194] Content providers of movie and video titles have conventionally had to produce, supply, and manage the inventory of individual titles in multiple languages, typically the language of each distribution market, and multi-rated title packages conforming to the parental control (censorship) regulations of individual countries in Europe and North America. The time and resources required for this are significant. While high image quality is obviously important, the programming content must also be consistently reproducible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0195\" num=\"0195\">[0195] The digital video disk recording medium is close to solving these problems. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0196\" num=\"0196\">[0196] Multiple Angles </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0197\" num=\"0197\">[0197] One interactive operation widely sought in multimedia applications today is for the user to be able to change the position from which a scene is viewed during reproduction of that scene. This capability is achieved by means of the multiple angle function. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0198\" num=\"0198\">[0198] This multiple angle function makes possible applications whereby, for example, a user can watch a baseball game from different angles (or virtual positions in the stadium), and can freely switch between the views while viewing is in progress. In this example of a baseball game, the available angles may include a position behind the backstop centered on the catcher, batter, and pitcher; one from behind the backstop centered on a fielder, the pitcher, and the catcher; and one from center field showing the view to the pitcher and catcher. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0199\" num=\"0199\">[0199] To meet these requirements, the digital video disk system uses MPEG, the same basic standard format used with Video-Cds to record the video, audio, graphics, and other signal data. Because of the differences in storage capacity, transfer rates, and signal processing performance within the reproduction apparatus, DVD uses MPEG2, the compression method and data format of which differ slightly from the MPEG1 format used with Video-Cds. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0200\" num=\"0200\">[0200] It should be noted that the content of and differences between the MPEG1 and MPEG2 standards have no direct relationship to the intent of the present invention, and further description is therefore omitted below (for more information, see MPEG specifications ISO-11172 and IS<b>0</b>-13818). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0201\" num=\"0201\">[0201] The data structure of the DVD system according to the present invention is described in detail below with reference to FIGS. 16, 17, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>21</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0202\" num=\"0202\">[0202] Multi-scene Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0203\" num=\"0203\">[0203] A fully functional and practical parental lock playback function and multi-angle scene playback function must enable the user to modify the system output in minor, subtle ways while still presenting substantially the same video and audio output. If these functions are achieved by preparing and recording separate titles satisfying each of the many possible parental lock and multi-angle scene playback requests, titles that are substantially identical and differ in only minor ways must be recorded to the recording medium. This results in identical data being repeatedly recorded to the larger part of the recording medium, and significantly reduces the utilization efficiency of the available storage capacity. More particularly, it is virtually impossible to record discrete titles satisfying every possible request even using the massive capacity of the digital video disk medium. While it may be concluded that this problem can be easily solved by increasing the capacity of the recording medium, this is an obviously undesirable solution when the effective use of available system resources is considered. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0204\" num=\"0204\">[0204] Using multi-scene control, the concept of which is described in another section below, in a DVD system, it is possible to dynamically construct titles for numerous variations of the same basic content using the smallest possible amount of data, and thereby effectively utilize the available system resources (recording medium). More specifically, titles that can be played back with numerous variations are constructed from basic (common) scene periods containing data common to each title, and multi-scene periods comprising groups of different scenes corresponding to the various requests. During reproduction, the user is able to freely and at any time select particular scenes from the multi-scene periods to dynamically construct a title conforming to the desired content, e.g., a title omitting certain scenes using the parental lock control function. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0205\" num=\"0205\">[0205] Note that multi-scene control enabling a parental lock playback control function and multi-angle scene playback is described in another section below with reference to FIG. 21. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0206\" num=\"0206\">[0206] Data Structure of the DVD System </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0207\" num=\"0207\">[0207] The data structure used in the authoring system of a digital video disk system according to the present invention is shown in FIG. 22. To record a multimedia bitstream MBS, this digital video disk system divides the recording medium into three major recording areas, the lead-in area LI, the volume space VS, and the lead-out area LO. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0208\" num=\"0208\">[0208] The lead-in area LI is provided at the inside circumference area of the optical disk. In the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10, the lead-in area LI is positioned at the inside end points IA and IB of each track. Data for stabilizing the operation of the reproducing apparatus when reading starts is written to the lead-in area LI. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0209\" num=\"0209\">[0209] The lead-out area LO is correspondingly located at the outside circumference of the optical disk, i.e., at outside end points OA and OB of each track in the disks described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10. Data identifying the end of the volume space VS is recorded in this lead-out area LO. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0210\" num=\"0210\">[0210] The volume space VS is located between the lead-in area LI and lead-out area LO, and is recorded as a one-dimensional array of n+1 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to zero) 2048-byte logic sectors LS. The logic sectors LS are sequentially number #<b>0</b>, #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, . . . #n. The volume space VS is also divided into a volume and file structure management area VFS and a file data structure area FDS. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0211\" num=\"0211\">[0211] The volume and file structure management area VFS comprises m+1 logic sectors LS#<b>0</b> to LS#m (where m is an integer greater than or equal to zero and less than n. The file data structure FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS #m+1 to LS #n. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0212\" num=\"0212\">[0212] Note that this file data structure area FDS corresponds to the multimedia bitstream MBS shown in FIG. 1 and described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0213\" num=\"0213\">[0213] The volume file structure VFS is the file system for managing the data stored to the volume space VS as files, and is divided into logic sectors LS#<b>0</b>-LS#m where m is the number of sectors required to store all data needed to manage the entire disk, and is a natural number less than n. Information for the files stored to the file data structure area FDS is written to the volume file structure VFS according to a known specification such as ISO-9660 or ISO-13346. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0214\" num=\"0214\">[0214] The file data structure area FDS comprises n-m logic sectors LS#m-LS#n, each comprising a video manager VMG sized to an integer multiple of the logic sector (2048\u00d7I, where I is a known integer), and k video title sets VTS #<b>1</b>-VTS#k (where k is a natural number less than 100). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0215\" num=\"0215\">[0215] The video manager VMG stores the title management information for the entire disk, and information for building a volume menu used to set and change reproduction control of the entire volume. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0216\" num=\"0216\">[0216] Any video title set VTS #k is also called a \u201cvideo file\u201d representing a title comprising video, audio, and/or still image data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0217\" num=\"0217\">[0217] The internal structure of each video title set VTS shown in FIG. 22 is shown in FIG. 16. Each video title set VTS comprises VTS information VTSI describing the management information for the entire disk, and the VTS title video objects VOB (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the system stream of the multimedia bitstream. The VTS information VTSI is described first below, followed by the VTS title VOBS. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0218\" num=\"0218\">[0218] The VTS information primarily includes the VTSI management table VTSI_MAT and VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0219\" num=\"0219\">[0219] The VTSI management table VTSI_MAT stores such information as the internal structure of the video title set VTS, the number of selectable audio streams contained in the video title set VTS, the number of sub-pictures, and the video title set VTS location (storage address). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0220\" num=\"0220\">[0220] The VTSPGC information table VTS_PGCIT records i (where i is a natural number) program chain (PGC) data blocks VTS_PGCI #<b>1</b>-VTS_PGCI #i for controlling the playback sequence. Each of the table entries VTS_PGCI #i is a data entry expressing the program chain, and comprises j (where j is a natural number) cell playback information blocks C_PBI #<b>1</b>-C_PBI #j. Each cell playback information block C_PBI #j contains the playback sequence of the cell and playback control information. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0221\" num=\"0221\">[0221] The program chain PGC is a conceptual structure describing the story of the title content, and therefore defines the structure of each title by describing the cell playback sequence. Note that these cells are described in detail below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0222\" num=\"0222\">[0222] If, for example, the video title set information relates to the menus, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts. If the user then presses a MENU button on a remote control device, for example, during playback, the playback device references the buffer to fetch the menu information and display the top menu #<b>1</b>. If the menus are hierarchical, the main menu stored as program chain information VTS_PGCI #<b>1</b> may be displayed, for example, by pressing the MENU button, VTS_PGCI #<b>2</b>-#<b>9</b> may correspond to submenus accessed using the numeric keypad on the remote control, and VTS_PGCI #<b>10</b> and higher may correspond to additional submenus further down the hierarchy. Alternatively, VTS_PGCI #<b>1</b> may be the top menu displayed by pressing the MENU button, while VTS_PGCI #<b>2</b> and higher may be voice guidance reproduced by pressing the corresponding numeric key. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0223\" num=\"0223\">[0223] The menus themselves are expressed by the plural program chains defined in this table. As a result, the menus may be freely constructed in various ways, and shall not be limited to hierarchical or non-hierarchical menus or menus containing voice guidance. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0224\" num=\"0224\">[0224] In the case of a movie, for example, the video title set information VTSI is stored to a buffer in the playback device when playback starts, the playback device references the cell playback sequence described by the program chain PGC, and reproduces the system stream. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0225\" num=\"0225\">[0225] The \u201ccells\u201d referenced here may be all or part of the system stream, and are used as access points during playback. Cells can therefore be used, for example, as the \u201cchapters\u201d into which a title may be divided. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0226\" num=\"0226\">[0226] Note that each of the PGC information entries C_PBI #j contain both cell playback processing information and a cell information table. The cell playback processing information comprises the processing information needed to reproduce the cell, such as the presentation time and number of repetitions. More specifically, this information includes the cell block mode CBM, cell block type CBT, seamless playback flag SPF, interleaved allocation flag IAF, STC resetting flag STCDF, cell presentation time C_PBTM, seamless angle change flag SACF, first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA, and the last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0227\" num=\"0227\">[0227] Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information. Seamless playback is described in detail in another section below with reference to FIG. 23 and FIG. 24. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0228\" num=\"0228\">[0228] The cell block mode CBM indicates whether plural cells constitute one functional block. The cell playback information of each cell in a functional block is arranged consecutively in the PGC information. The cell block mode CBM of the first cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the first cell in the block, and the cell block mode CBM of the last cell playback information in this sequence contains the value of the last cell in the block. The cell block mode CBM of each cell arrayed between these first and last cells contains a value indicating that the cell is a cell between these first and last cells in that block. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0229\" num=\"0229\">[0229] The cell block type CBT identifies the type of the block indicated by the cell block mode CBM. For example, when a multiple angle function is enabled, the cell information corresponding to each of the reproducible angles is programmed as one of the functional blocks mentioned above, and the type of these functional blocks is defined by a value identifying \u201cangle\u201d in the cell block type CBT for each cell in that block. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0230\" num=\"0230\">[0230] The seamless playback flag SPF simply indicates whether the corresponding cell is to be linked and played back seamlessly with the cell or cell block reproduced immediately therebefore. To seamlessly reproduce a given cell with the preceding cell or cell block, the seamless playback flag SPF is set to 1 in the cell playback information for that cell; otherwise SPF is set to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0231\" num=\"0231\">[0231] The interleaved allocation flag IAF stores a value identifying whether the cell exists in a contiguous or interleaved block. If the cell is part of an interleaved block, the flag IAF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0232\" num=\"0232\">[0232] The STC resetting flag STCDF identifies whether the system time clock STC used for synchronization must be reset when the cell is played back; when resetting the system time clock STC is necessary, the STC resetting flag STCDF is set to 1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0233\" num=\"0233\">[0233] The seamless angle change flag SACF stores a value indicating whether a cell in a multi-angle period should be connected seamlessly at an angle change. If the angle change is seamless, the seamless angle change flag SACF is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0234\" num=\"0234\">[0234] The cell presentation time C_PBTM expresses the cell presentation time with video frame precision. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0235\" num=\"0235\">[0235] The first cell VOBU start address C_FVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the first cell in a block, and is also expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by the number of sectors. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0236\" num=\"0236\">[0236] The last cell VOBU start address C_LVOBU_SA is the VOBU start address of the last cell in the block. The value of this address is expressed as the distance from the logic sector of the first cell in the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) as measured by the number of sectors. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0237\" num=\"0237\">[0237] The VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS), i.e., the multimedia system stream data, is described next. The system stream data VTSTT_VOBS comprises i (where i is a natural number) system streams SS, each of which is referred to as a \u201cvideo object\u201d (VOB). Each video object VOB #<b>1</b>-VOB #i comprises at least one video data block interleaved with up to a maximum eight audio data blocks and up to a maximum 32 sub-picture data blocks. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0238\" num=\"0238\">[0238] Each video object VOB comprises q (where q is a natural number) cells C#<b>1</b>-C#q. Each cell C comprises r (where r is a natural number) video object units VOBU #<b>1</b>-VOBU #r. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0239\" num=\"0239\">[0239] Each video object unit VOBU comprises plural groups_of_pictures GOP, and the audio and sub-pictures corresponding to the playback of said plural groups_of_pictures GOP. Note that the group_of_pictures GOP corresponds to the video encoding refresh cycle. Each video object unit VOBU also starts with an NV pack, i.e., the control data for that VOBU. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0240\" num=\"0240\">[0240] The structure of the navigation packs NV is described with reference to FIG. 19. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0241\" num=\"0241\">[0241] Before describing the navigation pack NV, the internal structure of the video zone VZ (see FIG. 22), i.e., the system stream St<b>35</b> encoded by the authoring encoder EC described with reference to FIG. 25, is described with reference to FIG. 17. Note that the encoded video stream St<b>15</b> shown in FIG. 17 is the compressed one-dimensional video data stream encoded by the video encoder <b>300</b>. The encoded audio stream St<b>19</b> is likewise the compressed one-dimensional audio data stream multiplexing the right and left stereo audio channels encoded by the audio encoder <b>700</b>. Note that the audio signal shall not be limited to a stereo signal, and may also be a multichannel surround-sound signal. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0242\" num=\"0242\">[0242] The system stream (title editing unit VOB) St<b>35</b> is a one dimensional array of packs with a byte size corresponding to the logic sectors LS #n having a 2048-byte capacity as described using FIG. 22. A stream control pack is placed at the beginning of the title editing unit (VOB) St<b>35</b>, i.e., at the beginning of the video object unit VOBU. This stream control pack is called the \u201cnavigation pack NV\u201d, and records the data arrangement in the system stream and other control information. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0243\" num=\"0243\">[0243] The encoded video stream St<b>15</b> and the encoded audio stream St<b>19</b> are packetized in byte units corresponding to the system stream packs. These packets are shown in FIG. 17 as packets V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b> . . . and A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b> . . . . As shown in FIG. 17, these packets are interleaved in the appropriate sequence as system stream St<b>35</b>, thus forming a packet stream, with consideration given to the decoder buffer size and the time required by the decoder to expand the video and audio data packets. In the example shown in FIG. 17, the packet stream is interleaved in the sequence V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, A<b>1</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b>, A<b>2</b> . . . . </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0244\" num=\"0244\">[0244] Note that the sequence shown in FIG. 17 interleaves one video data unit with one audio data unit. significantly increased recording/playback capacity, high speed recording/playback, and performance improvements in the signal processing LSI enable the DVD system to record plural audio data and plural sub-picture data (graphics data) to one video data unit in a single interleaved MPEG system stream, and thereby enable the user to select the specific audio data and sub-picture data to be reproduced during playback. The structure of the system stream used in this type of DVD system is shown in FIG. 18 and described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0245\" num=\"0245\">[0245] As in FIG. 17, the packetized encoded video stream St<b>15</b> is shown in FIG. 18 as V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, V<b>3</b>, V<b>4</b>, . . . In this example, however, there is not just one encoded audio stream St<b>19</b>, but three encoded audio streams St<b>19</b>A, St<b>19</b>B, and St<b>19</b>C input as the source data. There are also two encoded sub-picture streams St<b>17</b>A and St<b>17</b>B input as the source data sub-picture streams. These six compressed data streams, St<b>15</b>, St<b>19</b>A, St<b>19</b>B, St<b>19</b>C, St<b>17</b>A and St<b>17</b>B, are interleaved to a single system stream St<b>35</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0246\" num=\"0246\">[0246] The video data is encoded according to the MPEG specification with the group_of_pictures GOP being the unit of compression. In general, each group_of_pictures GOP contains 15 frames in the case of an NTSC signal, but the specific number of frames compressed to one GOP is variable. The stream management pack, which describes the management data containing, for example, the relationship between interleaved data, is also interleaved at the GOP unit interval. Because the group_of_pictures GOP unit is based on the video data, changing the number of video frames per GOP unit changes the interval of the stream management packs. This interval is expressed in terms of the presentation time on the digital video disk within a range from 0.4 sec. to 1.0 sec. referenced to the GOP unit. If the presentation time of contiguous plural GOP units is less than 1 sec., the management data packs for the video data of the plural GOP units is interleaved to a single stream. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0247\" num=\"0247\">[0247] These management data packs are referred to as navigation packs NV in the digital video disk system. The data from one navigation pack NV to the packet immediately preceding the next navigation pack NV forms one video object unit VOBU. In general, one contiguous playback unit that can be defined as one scene is called a video object VOB, and each video object VOB contains plural video object units VOBU. Data sets of plural video objects VOB form a VOB set (VOBS). Note that these data units were first used in the digital video disk. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0248\" num=\"0248\">[0248] When plural of these data streams are interleaved, the navigation packs NV defining the relationship between the interleaved packs must also be interleaved at a defined unit known as the pack number unit. Each group_of_pictures GOP is normally a unit containing approximately 0.5 sec. of video data, which is equivalent to the presentation time required for 12-15 frames, and one navigation pack NV is generally interleaved with the number of data packets required for this presentation time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0249\" num=\"0249\">[0249] The stream management information contained in the interleaved video, audio, and sub-picture data packets constituting the system stream is described below with reference to FIG. 19 As shown in FIG. 19, the data contained in the system stream is recorded in a format packed or packetized according to the MPEG2 standard. The packet structure is essentially the same for video, audio, and sub-picture data. One pack in the digital video disk system has a 2048 byte capacity as described above, and contains a pack header PKH and one packet PES; each packet PES contains a packet header PTH and data block. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0250\" num=\"0250\">[0250] The pack header PKH records the time at which that pack is to be sent from stream buffer <b>2400</b> to system decoder <b>2500</b> (see FIG. 26), i.e., the system clock reference SCR defining the reference time for synchronized audio-visual data playback. The MPEG standard assumes that the system clock reference SCR is the reference clock for the entire decoder operation. With such disk media as the digital video disk, however, time management specific to individual disk players can be used, and a reference clock for the decoder system is. therefore separately provided. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0251\" num=\"0251\">[0251] The packet header-PTH similarly contains a presentation time stamp PTS and a decoding time stamp DTS, both of which are placed in the packet before the access unit (the decoding unit). The presentation time stamp PTS defines the time at which the video data or audio data contained in the packet should be output as the playback output after being decoded, and the decoding time stamp DTS defines the time at which the video stream should be decoded. Note that the presentation time stamp PTS effectively defines the display start timing of the access unit, and the decoding time stamp DTS effectively defines the decoding start timing of the access unit. If the PTS and DTS are the same time, the DTS is omitted. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0252\" num=\"0252\">[0252] The packet header PTH also contains an 8-bit field called the stream ID identifying the packet type, i.e., whether the packet is a video packet containing a video data stream, a private packet, or an MPEG audio packet. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0253\" num=\"0253\">[0253] Private packets under the MPEG2 standard are data packets of which the content can be freely defined. Private packet <b>1</b> in this embodiment of the invention is used to carry audio data other than the MPEG audio data, and sub-picture data; private packet <b>2</b> carries the PCI packet and DSI packet. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0254\" num=\"0254\">[0254] Private packets <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> each comprise a packet header, private data area, and data area. The private data area contains an 8-bit sub-stream ID indicating whether the recorded data is audio data or sub-picture data. The audio data defined by private packet <b>2</b> may be defined as any of eight types #<b>0</b>-#<b>7</b> of linear PCM or AC-3 encoded data. Sub-picture data may be defined as one of up to 32 types #<b>0</b> -#<b>31</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0255\" num=\"0255\">[0255] The data area is the field to which data compressed according to the MPEG2 specification is written if the stored data is video data; linear PCM, AC-3, or MPEG encoded data is written if audio data is stored; or graphics data compressed by runlength coding is written if sub-picture data is stored. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0256\" num=\"0256\">[0256] MPEG2-compressed video data may be compressed by constant bit rate (CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR) coding. With constant bit rate coding, the video stream is input continuously to the video buffer at a constant rate. This contrasts with variable bit rate coding in which the video stream is input intermittently to the video buffer, thereby making it possible to suppress the generation of unnecessary code. Both constant bit rate and variable bit rate coding can be used in the digital video disk system. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0257\" num=\"0257\">[0257] Because MPEG video data is compressed with variable length coding, the data quantity in each group_of_pictures GOP is not constant. The video and audio decoding times also differ, and the time-base relationship between the video and audio data read from an optical disk, and the time-base relationship between the video and audio data output from the decoder, do not match. The method of time-base synchronizing the video and audio data is therefore described in detail below with reference to FIG. 26, but is described briefly below based on constant bit rate coding. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0258\" num=\"0258\">[0258] The navigation pack NV structure is shown in FIG. 20. Each navigation pack NV starts with a pack header PKH, and contains a PCI packet and DSI packet. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0259\" num=\"0259\">[0259] As described above, the pack header PKH records the time at which that pack is to be sent from stream buffer <b>2400</b> to system decoder <b>2500</b> (see FIG. 26), i.e., the system clock reference SCR defining the reference time for synchronized audio-visual data playback. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0260\" num=\"0260\">[0260] Each PCI packet contains PCI General Information (PCI_GI) and Angle Information for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGLI). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0261\" num=\"0261\">[0261] The PCI General Information (PCI_GI) declares the display time of the first video frame (the Start PTM of VOBU (VOBU_S_PTM)), and the display time of the last video frame (End PTM of VOBU (VOBU_E_PTM)), in the corresponding video object unit VOBU with system clock precision (90 Khz). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0262\" num=\"0262\">[0262] The Angle Information for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGLI) states the read start address of the corresponding video object unit VOBU when the angle is changed expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the video object VOB. Because there are nine or fewer angles in this example, there are nine angle address declaration cells: Destination Address of Angle Cell #<b>1</b> for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGL_C<b>1</b>_DSTA) to Destination Address of Angle Cell #<b>9</b> for Non-seamless playback (NMSL_AGL_C<b>9</b>_DSTA). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0263\" num=\"0263\">[0263] Each DSI packet contains DSI General Information (DSI_GI), Seamless Playback Information (SML_PBI), and Angle Information for Seamless playback (SML_AGLI). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0264\" num=\"0264\">[0264] The DSI General Information (DSI_GI) declares the address of the last pack in the video object unit VOBU, i. e., the End Address for VOB (VOBU_EA), expressed as the number of sectors from the beginning of the video object unit VOBU. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0265\" num=\"0265\">[0265] While seamless playback is described in detail later, it should be noted that the continuously read data units must be interleaved (multiplexed) at the system stream level as an interleaved unit ILVU in order to seamlessly reproduce split or combined titles. Plural system streams interleaved with the interleaved unit ILVU as the smallest unit are defined as an interleaved block. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0266\" num=\"0266\">[0266] The Seamless Playback Information (SML_PBI) is declared to seamlessly reproduce the stream interleaved with the interleaved unit ILVU as the smallest data unit, and contains an Interleaved Unit Flag (ILVU flag) identifying whether the corresponding video object unit VOBU is an interleaved block. The ILVU flag indicates whether the video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block, and is set to 1 when it is. Otherwise the ILVU flag is set to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0267\" num=\"0267\">[0267] When a video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block, a Unit END flag is declared to indicate whether the video object unit VOBU is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU. Because the interleaved unit ILVU is the data unit for continuous reading, the Unit END flag is set to 1 if the VOBU currently being read is the last VOBU in the interleaved unit ILVU. Otherwise the Unit END flag is set to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0268\" num=\"0268\">[0268] An Interleaved Unit End Address (ILVU_EA) identifying the address of the last pack in the ILVU to which the VOBU belongs, and the starting address of the next interleaved unit ILVU, Next Interleaved Unit Start Address (NT_ILVU_SA), are also declared when a video object unit VOBU is in an interleaved block. Both the Interleaved Unit End Address (ILVU_EA) and Next Interleaved Unit Start Address (NT_ILVU_SA) are expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0269\" num=\"0269\">[0269] When two system streams are seamlessly connected but the audio components of the two system streams are not contiguous, particularly immediately before and after the seam, it is necessary to pause the audio output to synchronize the audio and video components of the system stream following the seam. Note that non-contiguous audio may result from different audio signals being recording with the corresponding video blocks. With an NTSC signal, for example, the video frame cycle is approximately 33. 33 msec while the AC-3 audio frame cycle is 32 msec. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0270\" num=\"0270\">[0270] To enable this resynchronization, audio reproduction stopping times <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, i.e., Audio Stop PTM <b>1</b> in VOB (VOB_A_STP_PTM<b>1</b>), and Audio Stop PTM<b>2</b> in VOB (VOB_A_STP_PTM<b>2</b>), indicating the time at which the audio is to be paused; and audio reproduction stopping periods <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, i.e., Audio Gap Length <b>1</b> in VOB (VOB_A_GAP_LEN<b>1</b>) and Audio Gap Length <b>2</b> in VOB (VOB_A_GAP_LEN<b>2</b>), indicating for how long the audio is to be paused, are also declared in the DSI packet. Note that these times are specified at the system clock precision (90 Khz). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0271\" num=\"0271\">[0271] The Angle Information for Seamless playback (SML_AGLI) declares the read start address when the angle is changed. Note that this field is valid when seamless, multi-angle control is enabled. This address is also expressed as the number of sectors from the navigation pack NV of that VOBU. Because there are nine or fewer angles, there are nine angle address declaration cells: Destination Address of Angle Cell #<b>1</b> for Seamless playback (SML_AGL_C<b>1</b>_DSTA) to Destination Address of Angle Cell #<b>9</b> for Seamless playback (SML_AGL_C<b>9</b>_DSTA). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0272\" num=\"0272\">[0272] Note also that each title is edited in video object (VOB) units. Interleaved video objects (interleaved title editing units) are referenced as \u201cVOBS\u201d; and the encoded range of the source data is the encoding unit. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0273\" num=\"0273\">[0273] DVD Encoder </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0274\" num=\"0274\">[0274] A preferred embodiment of a digital video disk system authoring encoder ECD in which the multimedia bitstream authoring system according to the present invention is applied to a digital video disk system is described below and shown in FIG. 25. It will be obvious that the authoring encoder ECD applied to the digital video disk system, referred to below as a DVD encoder, is substantially identical to the authoring encoder EC shown in FIG. 2. The basic difference between these encoders is the replacement in the DVD encoder ECD of the video zone formatter <b>1300</b> of the authoring encoder EC above with a VOB buffer <b>1000</b> and formatter <b>1100</b>. It will also be obvious that the bitstream encoded by this DVD encoder ECD is recorded to a digital video disk medium M. The operation of this DVD encoder ECD is therefore described below in comparison with the authoring encoder EC described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0275\" num=\"0275\">[0275] As in the above authoring encoder EC, the encoding system controller <b>200</b> generates control signals St<b>9</b>, St<b>11</b>, St<b>13</b>, St<b>21</b>, St<b>23</b>, St<b>25</b>, St<b>33</b>, and St<b>39</b> based on the scenario data St<b>7</b> describing the user-defined editing instructions input from the scenario editor <b>100</b>, and controls the video encoder <b>300</b>, sub-picture encoder <b>500</b>, and audio encoder <b>700</b> in the DVD encoder ECD. Note that the user-defined editing instructions in the DVD encoder ECD are a superset of the editing instructions of the authoring encoder EC described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0276\" num=\"0276\">[0276] Specifically, the user-defined editing instructions (scenario data St<b>7</b>) in the DVD encoder ECD similarly describe what source data is selected from all or a subset of the source data containing plural titles within a defined time period, and how the selected source data is reassembled to reproduce the scenario (sequence) intended by the user. The scenario data St<b>7</b> of the DVD encoder ECD, however, further contains such information as: the number of streams contained in the editing units, which are obtained by splitting a multi-title source stream into blocks at a constant time interval; the number of audio and sub-picture data cells contained in each stream, and the sub-picture display time and period; whether the title is a multi-rated title enabling parental lock control; whether the user content is selected from plural streams including, for example, multiple viewing angles; and the method of connecting scenes when the angle is switched among the multiple viewing angles. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0277\" num=\"0277\">[0277] The scenario data St<b>7</b> of the DVD encoder ECD also contains control information on a video object VOB unit basis. This information is required to encode the media source stream, and specifically includes such information as whether there are multiple angles or parental control features. When multiple angle viewing is enabled, the scenario data St<b>7</b> also contains the encoding bit rate of each stream considering data interleaving and the disk capacity, the start and end times of each control, and whether a seamless connection should be made between the preceding and following streams. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0278\" num=\"0278\">[0278] The encoding system controller <b>200</b> extracts this information from the scenario data St<b>7</b>, and generates the encoding information table and encoding parameters required for encoding control. The encoding information table and encoding parameters are described with reference to FIGS. 27, 28, and <b>29</b> below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0279\" num=\"0279\">[0279] The stream encoding data St<b>33</b> contains the system stream encoding parameters and system encoding start and end timing values required by the DVD system to generate the VOBs. These system stream encoding parameters include the conditions for connecting one video object VOB with those before and after, the number of audio streams, the audio encoding information and audio Ids, the number of sub-pictures and the sub-picture Ids, the video playback starting time information VPTS, and the audio playback starting time information APTS. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0280\" num=\"0280\">[0280] The title sequence control signal St<b>39</b> supplies the multimedia bitstream MBS formatting start and end timing information and formatting parameters declaring the reproduction control information and interleave information. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0281\" num=\"0281\">[0281] Based on the video encoding parameter and encoding start/end timing signal St<b>9</b>, the video encoder <b>300</b> encodes a specific part of the video stream St<b>1</b> to generate an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in ISO-13818. This elementary stream is output to the video stream buffer <b>400</b> as encoded video stream St<b>15</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0282\" num=\"0282\">[0282] Note that while the video encoder <b>300</b> generates an elementary stream conforming to the MPEG2 Video standard defined in ISO-13818, specific encoding parameters are input via the video encoding parameter signal St<b>9</b>, including the encoding start and end timing, bit rate, the encoding conditions for the encoding start and end, the material type, including whether the material is an NTSC or PAL video signal or telecine converted material, and whether the encoding mode is set for either open GOP or closed GOP encoding. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0283\" num=\"0283\">[0283] The MPEG2 coding method is basically an interframe coding method using the correlation between frames for maximum signal compression, i.e., the frame being coded (the target frame) is coded by referencing frames before and/or after the target frame. However, intra-coded frames, i. e., frames that are coded based solely on the content of the target frame, are also inserted to avoid error propagation and enable accessibility from mid-stream (random access). The coding unit containing at least one intra-coded frame (\u201cintra-frame\u201d) is called a group_of_pictures GOP. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0284\" num=\"0284\">[0284] A group_of_pictures GOP in which coding is closed completely within that GOP is known as a \u201cclosed GOP.\u201d A group_of_pictures GOP containing a frame coded with reference to a frame in a preceding or following (ISO-13818 DOES NOT LIMIT P- and B-picture CODING to referencing PAST frames) group_of_pictures GOP is an \u201copen GOP.\u201d It is therefore possible to playback a closed GOP using only that GOP. Reproducing an open GOP, however, also requires the presence of the referenced GOP, generally the GOP preceding the open GOP. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0285\" num=\"0285\">[0285] The GOP is often used as the access unit. For example, the GOP may be used as the playback start point for reproducing a title from the middle, as a transition point in a movie, or for fast-forward play and other special reproduction modes. High speed reproduction can be achieved in such cases by reproducing only the intra-frame coded frames in a GOP or by reproducing only frames in GOP units. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0286\" num=\"0286\">[0286] Based on the sub-picture stream encoding parameter signal St<b>11</b>, the sub-picture encoder <b>500</b> encodes a specific part of the sub-picture stream St<b>3</b> to generate a variable length coded bitstream of bitmapped data. This variable length coded bitstream data is output as the encoded sub-picture stream St<b>17</b> to the sub-picture stream buffer <b>600</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0287\" num=\"0287\">[0287] Based on the audio encoding parameter signal St<b>13</b>, the audio encoder <b>700</b> encodes a specific part of the audio stream St<b>5</b> to generate the encoded audio data. This encoded audio data may be data based on the MPEG1 audio standard defined in ISO-11172 and the MPEG2 audio standard defined in ISO-13818, AC-3 audio data, or PCM (LPCM) data. Note that the methods and means of encoding audio data according to these standards are known and commonly available. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0288\" num=\"0288\">[0288] The video stream buffer <b>400</b> is connected to the video encoder <b>300</b> and to the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. The video stream buffer <b>400</b> stores the encoded video stream St<b>15</b> input from the video encoder <b>300</b>, and outputs the stored encoded video stream St<b>15</b> as the time-delayed encoded video stream St<b>27</b> based on the timing signal St<b>21</b> supplied from the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0289\" num=\"0289\">[0289] The sub-picture stream buffer <b>600</b> is similarly connected to the sub-picture encoder <b>500</b> and to the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. The sub-picture stream buffer <b>600</b> stores the encoded sub-picture stream St<b>17</b> input from the sub-picture encoder <b>500</b>, and then outputs the stored encoded sub-picture stream St<b>17</b> as time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St<b>29</b> based on the timing signal St<b>23</b> supplied from the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0290\" num=\"0290\">[0290] The audio stream buffer <b>800</b> is similarly connected to the audio encoder <b>700</b> and to the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. The audio stream buffer <b>800</b> stores the encoded audio stream St<b>19</b> input from the audio encoder <b>700</b>, and then outputs the encoded audio stream St<b>19</b> as the time-delayed encoded audio stream St<b>31</b> based on the timing signal St<b>25</b> supplied from the encoding system controller <b>200</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0291\" num=\"0291\">[0291] The system encoder <b>900</b> is connected to the video stream buffer <b>400</b>, sub-picture stream buffer <b>600</b>, audio stream buffer <b>800</b>, and the encoding system controller <b>200</b>, and is respectively supplied thereby with the time-delayed encoded video stream St<b>27</b>, time-delayed encoded sub-picture stream St<b>29</b>, time-delayed encoded audio stream St<b>31</b>, and the system stream encoding parameter data St<b>33</b>. Note that the system encoder <b>900</b> is a multiplexer that multiplexes the time-delayed streams St<b>27</b>, St<b>29</b>, and St<b>31</b> based on the stream encoding data St<b>33</b> (timing signal) to generate title editing units (VOBs) St<b>35</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0292\" num=\"0292\">[0292] The VOB buffer <b>1000</b> temporarily stores the video objects VOBs produced by the system encoder <b>900</b>. The formatter <b>1100</b> reads the delayed video objects VOB from the VOB buffer <b>1000</b> based on the title sequence control signal St<b>39</b> to generate one video zone VZ, and adds the volume file structure VFS to generate the edited multimedia stream data St<b>43</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0293\" num=\"0293\">[0293] The multimedia bitstream MBS St<b>43</b> edited according to the user-defined scenario is then sent to the recorder <b>1200</b>. The recorder <b>1200</b> processes the edited multimedia stream data St<b>43</b> to the data stream St<b>45</b> format of the recording medium M, and thus records the formatted data stream St<b>45</b> to the recording medium M. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0294\" num=\"0294\">[0294] DVD Decoder </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0295\" num=\"0295\">[0295] A preferred embodiment of a digital video disk system authoring decoder DCD in which the multimedia bitstream authoring system of the present invention is applied to a digital video disk system is described below and shown in FIG. 26. The authoring decoder DCD applied to the digital video disk system, referred to below as a DVD decoder DCD, decodes the multimedia bitstream MBS edited using the DVD encoder ECD of the present invention, and recreates the content of each title according to the user-defined scenario. It will also be obvious that the multimedia bitstream St<b>45</b> encoded by this DVD encoder ECD is recorded to a digital video disk medium M. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0296\" num=\"0296\">[0296] The basic configuration of the DVD decoder DCD according to this embodiment is the same as that of the authoring decoder DC shown in FIG. 3. The differences are that a different video decoder <b>3801</b> (shown as <b>3800</b> in FIG. 26) is used in place of the video decoder <b>3800</b>, and a reordering buffer <b>3300</b> and selector <b>3400</b> are disposed between the video decoder <b>3801</b> and synthesizer <b>3500</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0297\" num=\"0297\">[0297] Note that the selector <b>3400</b> is connected to the synchronizer <b>2900</b>, and is controlled by a switching signal St<b>103</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0298\" num=\"0298\">[0298] The operation of this DVD decoder DCD is therefore described below in comparison with the authoring decoder DC described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0299\" num=\"0299\">[0299] As shown in FIG. 26, the DVD decoder DCD comprises a multimedia bitstream producer <b>2000</b>, scenario selector <b>2100</b>, decoding system controller <b>2300</b>, stream buffer <b>2400</b>, system decoder <b>2500</b>, video buffer <b>2600</b>, sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>, audio buffer <b>2800</b>, synchronizer <b>2900</b>, video decoder <b>3801</b>, reordering buffer <b>3300</b>, sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b>, audio decoder <b>3200</b>, selector <b>3400</b>, synthesizer <b>3500</b>, video data output terminal <b>3600</b>, and audio data output terminal <b>3700</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0300\" num=\"0300\">[0300] The bitstream producer <b>2000</b> comprises a recording media drive unit <b>2004</b> for driving the recording medium M; a reading head <b>2006</b> for reading the information recorded to the recording medium M and producing the binary read signal St<b>57</b>; a signal processor <b>2008</b> for variously processing the read signal St<b>57</b> to generate the reproduced bitstream St<b>61</b>; and a reproduction controller <b>2002</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0301\" num=\"0301\">[0301] The reproduction controller <b>2002</b> is connected to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> from which the multimedia bitstream reproduction control signal St<b>53</b> is supplied, and in turn generates the reproduction control signals St<b>55</b> and St<b>59</b> respectively controlling the recording media drive unit (motor) <b>2004</b> and signal processor <b>2008</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0302\" num=\"0302\">[0302] So that the user-defined video, sub-picture, and audio portions of the multimedia title edited by the authoring encoder EC are reproduced, the authoring decoder DC comprises a scenario selector <b>2100</b> for selecting and reproducing the corresponding scenes (titles). The scenario selector <b>2100</b> then outputs the selected titles as scenario data to the DVD decoder DCD. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0303\" num=\"0303\">[0303] The scenario selector <b>2100</b> preferably comprises a keyboard, CPU, and monitor. Using the keyboard, the user then inputs the desired scenario based on the content of the scenario input by the DVD encoder ECD. Based on the keyboard input, the CPU generates the scenario selection data St<b>51</b> specifying the selected scenario. The scenario selector <b>2100</b> is connected to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> by an infrared communications device, for example, and inputs the generated scenario selection data St<b>51</b> to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0304\" num=\"0304\">[0304] The stream buffer <b>2400</b> has a specific buffer capacity used to temporarily store the reproduced bitstream St<b>61</b> input from the bitstream producer <b>2000</b>, extract the volume file structure VFS, the initial synchronization data SCR (system clock reference) in each pack, and the VOBU control information (DSI) in the navigation pack NV, to generate the bitstream control data St<b>63</b>. The stream buffer <b>2400</b> is also connected to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b>, to which it supplies the generated bitstream control data St<b>63</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0305\" num=\"0305\">[0305] Based on the scenario selection data St<b>51</b> supplied by the scenario selector <b>2100</b>, the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> then generates the bitstream reproduction control signal St<b>53</b> controlling the operation of the bitstream producer <b>2000</b>. The decoding system controller <b>2300</b> also extracts the user-defined playback instruction data from the bitstream reproduction control signal St<b>53</b>, and generates the decoding information table required for decoding control. This decoding information table is described further below with reference to FIGS. 26 and 32. The decoding system controller <b>2300</b> also extracts the title information recorded to the optical disk M from the file data structure area FDS of the bitstream control data St<b>63</b> to generate the title information signal St<b>200</b>. Note that the extracted title information includes the video manager VMG, VTS information VTSI, the PGC information entries C_PBI #j, and the cell presentation time C_PBTM. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0306\" num=\"0306\">[0306] Note that the bitstream control data St<b>63</b> is generated in pack units as shown in FIG. 19, and is supplied from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b>, to which the stream buffer <b>2400</b> is connected. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0307\" num=\"0307\">[0307] The synchronizer <b>2900</b> is connected to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> from which it receives the system clock reference SCR contained in the synchronization control data St<b>81</b> to set the internal system clock STC and supply the reset system clock St<b>79</b> to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0308\" num=\"0308\">[0308] Based on this system clock St<b>79</b>, the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> also generates the stream read signal St<b>65</b> at a specific interval and outputs the read signal St<b>65</b> to the stream buffer <b>2400</b>. Note that the read unit in this case is the pack. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0309\" num=\"0309\">[0309] The method of generating the stream read signal St<b>65</b> is described next. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0310\" num=\"0310\">[0310] The decoding system controller <b>2300</b> compares the system clock reference SCR contained in the stream control data extracted from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> with the system clock St<b>79</b> supplied from the synchronizer <b>2900</b>, and generates the read request signal St<b>65</b> when the system clock St<b>79</b> is greater than the system clock reference SCR of the bitstream control data St<b>63</b>. Pack transfers are controlled by executing this control process on a pack unit. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0311\" num=\"0311\">[0311] Based on the scenario selection data St<b>51</b>, the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> generates the decoding signal St<b>69</b> defining the stream Ids for the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams corresponding to the selected scenario, and outputs to the system decoder <b>2500</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0312\" num=\"0312\">[0312] When a title contains plural audio tracks, e.g. audio tracks in Japanese, English, French, and/or other languages, and plural sub-picture tracks for subtitles in Japanese, English, French, and/or other languages, for example, a discrete ID is assigned to each of the language tracks. As described above with reference to FIG. 19, a stream ID is assigned to the video data and MPEG audio data, and a substream ID is assigned to the sub-picture data, AC-3 audio data, linear PCM data, and navigation pack NV information. While the user need never be aware of these ID numbers, the user can select the language of the audio and/or subtitles using the scenario selector <b>2100</b>. If English language audio is selected, for example, the ID corresponding to the English audio track is sent to the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> as scenario selection data St<b>51</b>. The decoding system controller <b>2300</b> then adds this ID to the decoding signal St<b>69</b> output to the system decoder <b>2500</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0313\" num=\"0313\">[0313] Based on the instructions contained in the decoding signal St<b>69</b>, the system decoder <b>2500</b> respectively outputs the video, sub-picture, and audio bitstreams input from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> to the video buffer <b>2600</b>, sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>, and audio buffer <b>2800</b> as the encoded video stream St<b>71</b>, encoded sub-picture stream St<b>73</b>, and encoded audio stream St<b>75</b>. Thus, when the stream ID input from the scenario selector <b>2100</b> and the pack ID input from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> match, the system decoder <b>2500</b> outputs the corresponding packs to the respective buffers (i.e., the video buffer <b>2600</b>, sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>, and audio buffer <b>2800</b>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0314\" num=\"0314\">[0314] The system decoder <b>2500</b> detects the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS of the smallest control unit in each bitstream St<b>67</b> to generate the time information signal St<b>77</b>. This time information signal St<b>77</b> is supplied to the synchronizer <b>2900</b> through the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> as the synchronization control data St<b>81</b>. Based on this synchronization control data St<b>81</b>, the synchronizer <b>2900</b> determines the decoding start timing whereby each of the bitstreams will be arranged in the correct sequence after decoding, and then generates and inputs the video stream decoding start signal St<b>89</b> to the video decoder <b>3801</b> based on this decoding timing. The synchronizer <b>2900</b> also generates and supplies the sub-picture decoding start signal St<b>91</b> and audio stream decoding start signal St<b>93</b> to the sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b> and audio decoder <b>3200</b>, respectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0315\" num=\"0315\">[0315] The video decoder <b>3801</b> generates the video output request signal St<b>84</b> based on the video stream decoding start signal St<b>89</b>, and outputs to the video buffer <b>2600</b>. In response to the video output request signal St<b>84</b>, the video buffer <b>2600</b> outputs the video stream St<b>83</b> to the video decoder <b>3801</b>. The video decoder <b>3801</b> thus detects the presentation time information contained in the video stream St<b>83</b>, and disables the video output request signal St<b>84</b> when the length of the received video stream St<b>83</b> is equivalent to the specified presentation time. A video stream equal in length to the specified presentation time is thus decoded by the video decoder <b>3801</b>, which outputs the reproduced video signal St<b>95</b> to the reordering buffer <b>3300</b> and selector <b>3400</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0316\" num=\"0316\">[0316] Because the encoded video stream is coded using the interframe correlations between pictures, the coded order and display order do not necessarily match on a frame unit basis. The video cannot, therefore, be displayed in the decoded order. The decoded frames are therefore temporarily stored to the reordering buffer <b>3300</b>. The synchronizer <b>2900</b> therefore controls the switching signal St<b>103</b> so that the reproduced video signal St<b>95</b> output from the video decoder <b>3800</b> and the reordering buffer output St<b>97</b> are appropriately selected and output in the display order to the synthesizer <b>3500</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0317\" num=\"0317\">[0317] The sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b> similarly generates the sub-picture output request signal St<b>86</b> based on the sub-picture decoding start signal St<b>91</b>, and outputs to the sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>. In response to the sub-picture output request signal St<b>86</b>, the sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b> outputs the sub-picture stream St<b>85</b> to the sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b>. Based on the presentation time information contained in the sub-picture stream St<b>85</b>, the sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b> decodes a length of the sub-picture stream St<b>85</b> corresponding to the specified presentation time to reproduce and supply to the synthesizer <b>3500</b> the sub-picture signal St<b>99</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0318\" num=\"0318\">[0318] The synthesizer <b>3500</b> superimposes the selector <b>3400</b> output with the sub-picture signal St<b>99</b> to generate and output the video signal St<b>105</b> to the video data output terminal <b>3600</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0319\" num=\"0319\">[0319] The audio decoder <b>3200</b> generates and supplies to the audio buffer <b>2800</b> the audio output request signal St<b>88</b> based on the audio stream decoding start signal St<b>93</b>. The audio buffer <b>2800</b> thus outputs the audio stream St<b>87</b> to the audio decoder <b>3200</b>. The audio decoder <b>3200</b> decodes a length of the audio stream St<b>87</b> corresponding to the specified presentation time based on the presentation time information contained in the audio stream St<b>87</b>, and outputs the decoded audio stream St<b>101</b> to the audio data output terminal <b>3700</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0320\" num=\"0320\">[0320] It is thus possible to reproduce a user-defined multimedia bitstream MBS in real-time according to a user-defined scenario. More specifically, each time the user selects a different scenario, the DVD decoder DCD is able to reproduce the title content desired by the user in the desired sequence by reproducing the multimedia bitstream MBS corresponding to the selected scenario. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0321\" num=\"0321\">[0321] It should be noted that the decoding system controller <b>2300</b> may supply the title information signal St<b>200</b> to the scenario selector <b>2100</b> by means of the infrared communications device mentioned above or another means. Interactive scenario selection controlled by the user can also be made possible by the scenario selector <b>2100</b> extracting the title information recorded to the optical disk M from the file data structure area FDS of the bitstream control data St<b>63</b> contained in the title information signal St<b>200</b>, and displaying this title information on a display for user selection. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0322\" num=\"0322\">[0322] Note, further, that the stream buffer <b>2400</b>, video buffer <b>2600</b>, sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>, audio buffer <b>2800</b>, and reordering buffer <b>3300</b> are expressed above and in the figures as separate entities because they are functionally different. It will be obvious, however, that a single buffer memory can be controlled to provide the same discrete functionality by time-share controlled use of a buffer memory with an operating speed plural times faster than the read and write rates of these separate buffers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0323\" num=\"0323\">[0323] Multi-scene Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0324\" num=\"0324\">[0324] The concept of multiple angle scene control according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 21. As described above, titles that can be played back with numerous variations are constructed from basic scene periods containing data common to each title, and multi-scene periods comprising groups of different scenes corresponding to the various scenario requests. In FIG. 21, scenes <b>1</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>8</b> are the common scenes of the basic scene.-periods. The multi-angle scenes (angles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>) between scenes <b>1</b> and <b>5</b>, and the parental locked scenes (scenes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>) between scenes <b>5</b> and <b>8</b>, are the multi-scene periods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0325\" num=\"0325\">[0325] Scenes taken from different angles, i.e., angles <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> in this example, can be dynamically selected and reproduced during playback in the multi-angle scene period. In the parental locked scene period, however, only one of the available scenes, scenes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, having different content can be selected, and must be selected statically before playback begins. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0326\" num=\"0326\">[0326] Which of these scenes from the multi-scene periods is to be selected and reproduced is defined by the user operating the scenario selector <b>2100</b> and thereby generating the scenario selection data St<b>51</b>. In scenario <b>1</b> in FIG. 21 the user can freely select any of the multi-angle scenes, and scene <b>6</b> has been preselected for output in the parental locked scene period. Similarly in scenario <b>2</b>, the user can freely select any of the multi-angle scenes, and scene <b>7</b> has been preselected for output in the parental locked scene period. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0327\" num=\"0327\">[0327] With reference to FIGS. 30 and 31, furthermore, the contents of the program chain information VTS_PGCI is described. In FIG. 30, the case that a scenario requested by the user is shown with respect to a VTSI data construction. The scenario <b>1</b> and scenario <b>2</b> shown in FIG. 21 are described as program chain information VTS_PGC#<b>1</b> and VTS_PGC#<b>2</b>. VTS_PGC#<b>1</b> describing the scenario <b>1</b> consists of cell playback information C_PBI#<b>1</b> corresponding to scene <b>1</b>, C_PBI#<b>2</b>, C_PBI#<b>3</b>, and C_PBI#<b>4</b> within a multi-angle cell block, C_PBI#<b>5</b> corresponding to scene <b>5</b>, C_PBI#<b>6</b> corresponding to scene <b>6</b>, and C_PBI#<b>7</b> corresponding to scene <b>8</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0328\" num=\"0328\">[0328] VTS_PGCI#<b>2</b> describing the scenario <b>2</b> consists of cell playback information C_PBI#<b>1</b> corresponding to scene <b>1</b>, C_PBI#<b>2</b>, C_PBI#<b>3</b>, and C_PBI#<b>4</b> within a multi-angle cell block corresponding to a multi-angle scene, C_PBI#<b>5</b> corresponding to scene <b>5</b>, C_PBI#<b>6</b> corresponding to scene <b>7</b>, and C_PBI#<b>7</b> corresponding to scene <b>8</b>. According to the digital video system data structure, a scene which is a control unit of a scenario is described as a cell which is a unit thereunder, thus a scenario requested by a user can be obtained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0329\" num=\"0329\">[0329] In FIG. 31, the case that a scenario requested by the user shown in FIG. 21 is shown with respect to a VOB data construction VTSTT_VOBS. As specifically shown in FIG. 31, the two scenarios <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> use the same VOB data in common. With respect to a single scene commonly owned by each scenario, VOB#<b>1</b> corresponding to scene <b>1</b>, VOB#<b>5</b> corresponding to scene <b>5</b>, and VOB#<b>8</b> corresponding to scene <b>8</b> are arranged in non-interleaved block which is the contiguous block. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0330\" num=\"0330\">[0330] With respect to the multi-angle data commonly owned by scenarios <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, one angle scene data is constructed by a single VOB. Specifically speaking, angle <b>1</b> is constructed by VOB#<b>2</b>, and angle <b>2</b> is constructed by VOB#<b>3</b>, angle <b>3</b> is constructed by VOB#<b>4</b>. Thus constructed multi-angle data is formed as the interleaved block for the sake of switching between each angle and seamless reproduction of each angle data. Scenes <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> peculiar to scenarios <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively, are formed as the interleaved block for the sake of seamless reproduction between common scenes before and behind thereof as well as seamless reproduction between each scene. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0331\" num=\"0331\">[0331] As described in the above, the user&#39;s requesting scenario shown in FIG. 21 can be realized by utilizing the video title playback control information shown in FIG. 30 and the title playback VOB data structure shown in FIG. 31. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0332\" num=\"0332\">[0332] Seamless Playback </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0333\" num=\"0333\">[0333] The seamless playback capability briefly mentioned above with regard to the digital video disk system data structure is described below. Note that seamless playback refers to the reproduction in a digital video disk system of multimedia data including video, audio, and sub-picture data without intermittent breaks in the data or information between basic scene periods, between basic scene periods and multi-scene periods, and between multi-scene periods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0334\" num=\"0334\">[0334] Hardware factors contributing to intermittent playback of this data and title content include decoder underflow, i.e., an imbalance between the source data input speed and the decoding speed of the input source data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0335\" num=\"0335\">[0335] Other factors relate to the properties of the playback data. When the playback data is data that must be continuously reproduced for a constant time unit in order for the user to understand the content or information, e.g., audio data, data continuity is lost when the required continuous presentation time cannot be assured. Reproduction of such information whereby the required continuity is assured is referred to as \u201ccontiguous information reproduction,\u201d or \u201cseamless information reproduction.\u201d Reproduction of this information when the required continuity cannot be assured is referred to as \u201cnon-continuous information reproduction,\u201d or \u201cnon-seamless information reproduction.\u201d It is obvious that continuous information reproduction and non-continuous information reproduction are, respectively, seamless and non-seamless reproduction. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0336\" num=\"0336\">[0336] Note that seamless reproduction can be further categorized as seamless data reproduction and seamless information reproduction. Seamless data reproduction is defined as preventing physical blanks or interruptions in the data playback (intermittent reproduction) as a result of a buffer underflow state, for example. Seamless information reproduction is defined as preventing apparent interruptions in the information when perceived by the user (intermittent presentation) when recognizing information from the playback data where there are no actual physical breaks in the data reproduction. The specific method enabling seamless reproduction as thus described is described later below with reference to FIGS. 23 and 24. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0337\" num=\"0337\">[0337] Interleaving </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0338\" num=\"0338\">[0338] The DVD data system streams described above are recorded using an appropriate authoring encoder EC as a movie or other multimedia title on a DVD recording medium. Note that the following description refers to a movie as the multimedia title being processed, but it will be obvious that the invention shall not be so limited. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0339\" num=\"0339\">[0339] Supplying a single movie in a format enabling the movie to be used in plural different cultural regions or countries requires the script to be recorded in the various languages used in those regions or countries. It may even necessitate editing the content to conform to the mores and moral expectations of different cultures. Even using such a large-capacity storage system as the DVD system, however, it is necessary to reduce the bit rate, and therefore the image quality, if plural full-length titles edited from a single common source title are recorded to a single disk. This problem can be solved by recording the common parts of plural titles only once, and recording the segments different in each title for each different title only. This method makes it possible to record plural titles for different countries or cultures to a single optical disk without reducing the bit rate, and, therefore, retaining high image quality. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0340\" num=\"0340\">[0340] As shown in FIG. 21, the titles recorded to a single optical disk contain basic scene periods of scenes common to all scenarios, and multi-scene periods containing scenes specific to certain scenarios, to provide parental lock control and multi-angle scene control functions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0341\" num=\"0341\">[0341] In the case of the parental lock control function, titles containing sex scenes, violent scenes, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children, i.e., so-called \u201cadult scenes,\u201d are recorded with a combination of common scenes, adult scenes, and children&#39;s scenes. These title streams are achieved by arraying the adult and children&#39;s scenes to multi-scene periods between the common basic scene periods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0342\" num=\"0342\">[0342] Multi-angle control can be achieved in a conventional single-angle title by recording plural multimedia scenes obtained by recording the subjects from the desired plural camera angles to the multi-scene periods arrayed between the common basic scene periods. Note, however, that while these plural scenes are described here as scenes recorded from different camera angles (positions), it will be obvious that the scenes may be recorded from the same camera angle but at different times, data generated by computer graphics, or other video data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0343\" num=\"0343\">[0343] When data is shared between different scenarios of a single title, it is obviously necessary to move the laser beam LS from the common scene data to the non-common scene data during reproduction, i.e., to move the optical pickup to a different position on the DVD recording medium RC<b>1</b>. The problem here is that the time required to move the optical pickup makes it difficult to continue reproduction without creating breaks in the audio or video, i.e., to sustain seamless reproduction. This problem can be theoretically solved by providing a track buffer (stream buffer <b>2400</b>) to delay data output an amount equivalent to the worst access time. In general, data recorded to an optical disk is read by the optical pickup, appropriately processed, and temporarily stored to the track buffer. The stored data is subsequently-decoded and reproduced as video or audio data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0344\" num=\"0344\">[0344] To thus enable the user to selectively excise scenes and choose from among plural scenes, a state wherein non-selected scene data is recorded inserted between common scene data and selective scene data necessarily occurs because the data units associated with individual scenes are contiguously recorded to the recording tracks of the recording medium. If data is then read in the recorded sequence, non-selected scene data must be accessed before accessing and decoding the selected scene data, and seamless connections with the selected scene is difficult. The excellent random access characteristics of the digital video disk system, however, make seamless connections with the selected scenes possible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0345\" num=\"0345\">[0345] In other words, by splitting scene-specific data into plural units of a specified data size, and interleaving plural split data units for different scenes in a predefined sequence that is recorded to disk within the jumping range whereby an data underflow state does not occur, it is possible to reproduce the selected scenes without data interruptions by intermittently accessing and decoding the data specific to the selected scenes using these split data units. Seamless data reproduction is thereby assured. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0346\" num=\"0346\">[0346] Interleaved Block and Interleave Unit </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0347\" num=\"0347\">[0347] The interleaving method enabling seamless data reproduction according to the present invention is described below with reference to FIG. 24. and FIG. 71. Shown in FIG. 24 is a case from which three scenarios may be derived, i.e., branching from one video object VOB-A to one of plural video objects VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D, and then merging back again to a single video object VOB-E. The actual arrangement of these blocks recorded to a data recording track TR on disk is shown in FIG. 71. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0348\" num=\"0348\">[0348] Referring to FIG. 71, VOB-A and VOB-E are video objects with independent playback start and end times, and are in principle arrayed to contiguous block regions. As shown in FIG. 24, the playback start and end times of VOB-B, VOB-C, and VOB-D are aligned during interleaving. The interleaved data blocks are then recorded to disk to a contiguous interleaved block region. The contiguous block regions and interleaved block regions are then written to disk in the track path Dr direction in the playback sequence. Plural video objects VOB, i.e., interleaved video objects VOBS, arrayed to the data recording track TR are shown in FIG. 37. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0349\" num=\"0349\">[0349] Referring to FIG. 37, data regions to which data is continuously arrayed are called \u201cblocks,\u201d of which there are two types: \u201ccontiguous block regions\u201d in which VOB with discrete starting and end points are contiguously arrayed, and \u201cinterleaved block regions\u201d in which plural VOB with aligned starting and end points are interleaved. The respective blocks are arrayed as shown in FIG. 38 in the playback sequence, i.e., block <b>1</b>, block <b>2</b>, block <b>3</b>, . . . block <b>7</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0350\" num=\"0350\">[0350] As shown in FIG. 73, the VTS title VOBS (VTSTT_VOBS) consist of blocks <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>, inclusive. Block <b>1</b> contains VOB <b>1</b> alone. Blocks <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b> similarly discretely contain VOBS <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>10</b>. Blocks <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b> are thus contiguous block regions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0351\" num=\"0351\">[0351] Block <b>4</b>, however, contains VOB <b>4</b> and VOB <b>5</b> interleaved together, while block <b>6</b> contains VOB <b>7</b>, VOB <b>8</b>, and VOB <b>9</b> interleaved together. Blocks <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are thus interleaved block regions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0352\" num=\"0352\">[0352] The internal data structure of the contiguous block regions is shown in FIG. 73 with VOB-i and VOB-j arrayed as the contiguous blocks in the VOBs. As described with reference to FIG. 16, VOB-i and VOB-j inside the contiguous block regions are further logically divided into cells as the playback unit. Both VOB-i and VOB-j in this figure are shown comprising three cells CELL #<b>1</b>, CELL #<b>2</b>, and CELL #<b>3</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0353\" num=\"0353\">[0353] Each cell comprises one or more video object unit VOBU with the video object unit VOBU defining the boundaries of the cell. Each cell also contains information identifying the position of the cell in the program chain PGC (the playback control information of the digital video disk system). More specifically, this position information is the address of the first and last VOBU in the cell. As also shown in FIG. 73, these VOB and the cells defined therein are also recorded to a contiguous block region so that contiguous blocks are contiguously reproduced. Reproducing these contiguous blocks is therefore no problem. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0354\" num=\"0354\">[0354] The internal data structure of the interleaved block regions is shown in FIG. 74. In the interleaved block regions each video object VOB is divided into interleaved units ILVU, and the interleaved units ILVU associated with each VOB are alternately arrayed. Cell boundaries are defined independently of the interleaved units ILVU. For example, VOB-k is divided into four interleaved units ILVUk<b>1</b>, ILVUk<b>2</b>, ILVUk<b>3</b>, and ILVUk<b>4</b>, and are confined by a single cell CELL#k. VOB-k is likewise divided into four interleaved units ILVUm<b>1</b>, ILVUm<b>2</b>, ILVUm<b>3</b>, and ILVUm<b>4</b>, and is confined by a sincle cell CELL#m. Note that instead of a single cell CELL#k or CELL#m, each of VOB-k and VOB-m can be divided into more than two cells. The interleaved units ILVU thus contains both audio and video data. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0355\" num=\"0355\">[0355] In the example shown in FIG. 74, the interleaved units ILVUk<b>1</b>, ILVUk<b>2</b>, ILVUk<b>3</b>, and ILVUk<b>4</b>, and ILVUm<b>1</b>, ILVUm<b>2</b>, ILVUm<b>3</b>, and ILVUm<b>4</b>, from two different video objects VOB-k and VOB-m are alternately arrayed within a single interleaved block. By interleaving the interleaved units ILVU of two video objects VOB in this sequence, it is possible to achieve seamless reproduction branching from one scene to one of plural scenes, and from one of plural scenes to one scene. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0356\" num=\"0356\">[0356] Multi-scene Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0357\" num=\"0357\">[0357] The multi-scene period is described together with the concept of multi-scene control according to the present invention using by way of example a title comprising scenes recorded from different angles. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0358\" num=\"0358\">[0358] Each scene in multi-scene control is recorded from the same angle, but may be recorded at different times or may even be computer graphics data. The multi-angle scene periods may therefore also be called multi-scene periods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0359\" num=\"0359\">[0359] Parental Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0360\" num=\"0360\">[0360] The concept of recording plural titles comprising alternative scenes for such functions as parental lock control and recording director&#39;s cuts is described below using FIG. 15. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0361\" num=\"0361\">[0361] An example of a multi-rated title stream providing for parental lock control is shown in FIG. 15. When so-called \u201cadult scenes\u201d containing sex, violence, or other scenes deemed unsuitable for children are contained in a title implementing parental lock control, the title stream is recorded with a combination of common system streams SSa, SSb, and Sse, an adult-oriented system stream SSc containing the adult scenes, and a child-oriented system stream SSd containing only the scenes suitable for children. Title streams such as this are recorded as a multi-scene system stream containing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and the child-oriented system stream Ssd arrayed to the multi-scene period between common system streams Ssb and Sse. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0362\" num=\"0362\">[0362] The relationship between each of the component titles and the system stream recorded to the program chain PGC of a title stream thus comprised is described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0363\" num=\"0363\">[0363] The adult-oriented title program chain PGC<b>1</b> comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and the common system stream Sse. The child-oriented title program chain PGC<b>2</b> comprises in sequence the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, the child-oriented system stream Ssd, and the common system stream Sse. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0364\" num=\"0364\">[0364] By thus arraying the adult-oriented system stream Ssc and child-oriented system stream Ssd to a multi-scene period, the decoding method previously described can reproduce the title containing adult-oriented content by reproducing the common system streams Ssa and Ssb, then selecting and reproducing the adult-oriented system stream Ssc, and then reproducing the common system stream Sse as instructed by the adult-oriented title program chain PGC<b>1</b>. By alternatively following the child-oriented title program chain PGC<b>2</b> and selecting the child-oriented system stream Ssd in the multi-scene period, a child-oriented title from which the adult-oriented scenes have been expurgated can be reproduced. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0365\" num=\"0365\">[0365] This method of providing in the title stream a multi-scene period containing plural alternative scenes, selecting which of the scenes in the multi-scene period are to be reproduced before playback begins, and generating plural titles containing essentially the same title content but different scenes in part, is called parental lock control. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0366\" num=\"0366\">[0366] Note that parental lock control is so named because of the perceived need to protect children from undesirable content. From the perspective of system stream processing, however, parental lock control is a technology for statically generating different title streams by means of the user pre-selecting specific scenes from a multi-scene period. Note, further, that this contrasts with multi-angle scene control, which is a technology for dynamically changing the content of a single title by means of the user selecting scenes from the multi-scene period freely and in real-time during title playback. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0367\" num=\"0367\">[0367] This parental lock control technology can also be used to enable title stream editing such as when making the director&#39;s cut. The director&#39;s cut refers to the process of editing certain scenes from a movie to, for example, shorten the total presentation time. This may be necessary, for example, to edit a feature-length movie for viewing on an airplane where the presentation time is too long for viewing within the flight time or certain content may not be acceptable. The movie director thus determines which scenes may be cut to shorten the movie. The title can then be recorded with both a full-length, unedited system stream and an edited system stream in which the edited scenes are recorded to multi-scene periods. At the transition from one system stream to another system stream in such applications, parental lock control must be able to maintain smooth playback image output. More specifically, seamless data reproduction whereby a data underflow state does not occur in the audio, video, or other buffers, and seamless information reproduction whereby no unnatural interruptions are audibly or visibly perceived in the audio and video playback, are necessary. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0368\" num=\"0368\">[0368] Multi-angle Control </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0369\" num=\"0369\">[0369] The concept of multi-angle scene control in the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 33. In general, multimedia titles are obtained by recording both the audio and video information (collectively \u201crecording\u201d below) of the subject over time T. The angled scene blocks #SC<b>1</b>, #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, #SM<b>3</b>, and #SC<b>3</b> represent the multimedia scenes obtained at recording unit times T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b> by recording the subject at respective camera angles. Scenes #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, and #SM<b>3</b> are recorded at mutually different (first, second, and third) camera angles during recording unit time T<b>2</b>, and are referenced below as the first, second, and third angled scenes. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0370\" num=\"0370\">[0370] Note that the multi-scene periods referenced herein are basically assumed to comprise scenes recorded from different angles. The scenes may, however, be recorded from the same angle but at different times, or they may be computer graphics data. The multi-angle scene periods are thus the multi-scene periods from which plural scenes can be selected for presentation in the same time period, whether or not the scenes are actually recorded at different camera angles. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0371\" num=\"0371\">[0371] Scenes #SC<b>1</b> and #SC<b>3</b> are scenes recorded at the same common camera angle during recording unit times T<b>1</b> and T<b>3</b>, i.e., before and after the multi-angle scenes. These scenes are therefore called \u201ccommon angle scenes.\u201d Note that one of the multiple camera angles used in the multi-angle scenes is usually the same as the common camera angle. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0372\" num=\"0372\">[0372] To understand the relationship between these various angled scenes, multi-angle scene control is described below using a live broadcast of a baseball game for example only. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0373\" num=\"0373\">[0373] The common angle scenes #SC<b>1</b> and #SC<b>3</b> are recorded at the common camera angle, which is here defined as the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0374\" num=\"0374\">[0374] The first angled scene #SM<b>1</b> is recorded at the first multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop on the axis through the catcher, pitcher, and batter. The second angled scene #SM<b>2</b> is recorded at the second multi-camera angle, i.e., the view from center field on the axis through the pitcher, batter, and catcher. Note that the second angled scene #SM<b>2</b> is thus the same as the common camera angle in this example. It therefore follows that the second angled scene #SM<b>2</b> is the same as the common angle scene #SC<b>2</b> recorded during recording unit time T<b>2</b>. The third angled scene #SM<b>3</b> is recorded at the third multi-camera angle, i.e., the camera angle from the backstop focusing on the infield. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0375\" num=\"0375\">[0375] The presentation times of the multiple angle scenes #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, and #SM<b>3</b> overlap in recording unit time T<b>2</b>; this period is called the \u201cmulti-angle scene period.\u201d By freely selecting one of the multiple angle scenes #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, and #SM<b>3</b> in this multi-angle scene period, the viewer is able to change his or her virtual viewing position to enjoy a different view of the game as though the actual camera angle is changed. Note that while there appears to be a time gap between common angle scenes #SC<b>1</b> and #SC<b>3</b> and the multiple angle scenes #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, and #SM<b>3</b> in FIG. 33, this is simply to facilitate the use of arrows in the figure for easier description of the data reproduction paths reproduced by selecting different angled scenes. There is no actual time gap during playback. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0376\" num=\"0376\">[0376] Multi-angle scene control of the system stream based on the present invention is described next with reference to FIG. 23 from the perspective of connecting data blocks. The multimedia data corresponding to common angle scene #SC is referenced as common angle data BA, and the common angle data BA in recording unit times T<b>1</b> and T<b>3</b> are referenced as BA<b>1</b> and BA<b>3</b>, respectively. The multimedia data corresponding to the multiple angle scenes #SM<b>1</b>, #SM<b>2</b>, and #SM<b>3</b> are referenced as first, second, and third angle scene data MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>, and MA<b>3</b>. As previously described with reference to FIG. 33, scenes from the desired angled can be viewed by selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>, and MA<b>3</b>. There is also no time gap between the common angle data BA<b>1</b> and BA<b>3</b> and the multiple angle data units MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>, and MA<b>3</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0377\" num=\"0377\">[0377] In the case of an MPEG system stream, however, intermittent breaks in the playback information can result between the reproduced common and multiple angle data units depending upon the content of the data at the connection between the selected multiple angle data unit MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>, and MA<b>3</b> and the common angle data BA (either the first common angle data BA<b>1</b> before the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period or the common angle data BA<b>3</b> following the angle selected in the multi-angle scene period). The result in this case is that the title stream is not naturally reproduced as a single contiguous title, i.e., seamless data reproduction is achieved but non-seamless information reproduction results. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0378\" num=\"0378\">[0378] The multi-angle selection process whereby one of plural scenes is selectively reproduced from the multi-angle scene period with seamless information presentation to the scenes before and after is described below with application in a digital video disk system using FIG. 23. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0379\" num=\"0379\">[0379] Changing the scene angle, i.e., selecting one of the multiple angle data units MA<b>1</b>, MA<b>2</b>, and MA<b>3</b>, must be completed before reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA<b>1</b> is completed. It is extremely difficult, for example, to change to a different angle data unit MA<b>2</b> during reproduction of common angle data BA<b>1</b>. This is because the multimedia data has a variable length coded MPEG data structure, which makes it difficult to find the data break points (boundaries) in the selected data blocks. The video may also be disrupted when the angle is changed because inter-frame correlations are used in the coding process. The group_of_pictures GOP processing unit of the MPEG standard contains at least one refresh frame, and closed processing not referencing frames belonging to another GOP is possible within this GOP processing unit. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0380\" num=\"0380\">[0380] In other words, if the desired angle data, e. g., MA<b>3</b>, is selected before reproduction reaches the multi-angle scene period, and at the latest by the time reproduction of the preceding common angle data BA<b>1</b> is completed, the angle data selected from within the multi-angle scene period can be seamlessly reproduced. However, it is extremely difficult while reproducing one angle to select and seamlessly reproduce another angle within the same multi-angle scene period. It is therefore difficult when in a multi-angle scene period to dynamically select a different angle unit presenting, for example, a view from a different camera angle. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0381\" num=\"0381\">[0381] Flow Chart: Encoder </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0382\" num=\"0382\">[0382] The encoding information table generated by the encoding system controller <b>200</b> from information extracted from the scenario data St<b>7</b> is described below referring to FIG. 27. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0383\" num=\"0383\">[0383] The encoding information table contains VOB set data streams containing plural VOB corresponding to the scene periods beginning and ending at the scene branching and connecting points, and VOB data streams corresponding to each scene.

The system buffer <b>2404</b> temporarily stores the title control data VTSI(FIG. 16) included in signal St<b>61</b>, and outputs a control information St<b>2450</b> (St<b>63</b>) such as VTS_PGC. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0688\" num=\"0688\">[0688] The VOB buffer <b>2402</b> temporarily stores the title VOB data VTSTT_VOB (FIG. 16), and the stream St<b>67</b> to the system decoder <b>2500</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0689\" num=\"0689\">[0689] The NV (navigation pack) extractor <b>2406</b> receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer <b>2402</b>, and extracts the navigation pack NV therefrom. The NV extractor <b>2406</b> furthermore extracts the VOBU final pack address COBU_EA or ILVU final pack address ILVU_EA which are the DSI generation information DSI_GI shown in FIG. 19 to produce a pack address information St<b>2452</b> (St<b>63</b>). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0690\" num=\"0690\">[0690] The data counter <b>2408</b> receives the VOB data at the same time with the VOB buffer <b>2402</b>, and counts each of pack data shown in FIG. 19 byte by byte. Then, the data counter <b>2408</b> produces a pack input terminating signal St<b>2454</b> (St<b>63</b>) at the time when the inputting of pack data is completed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0691\" num=\"0691\">[0691] Due to its construction shown in FIG. 69, the stream buffer <b>2400</b> performs the VOBU data transfer as examples at step #<b>31064</b> of FIG. 64, as follows. The stream buffer <b>2400</b> outputs the VOBU data for the NV extractor <b>2406</b> and data counter <b>2408</b> at the same time when the VOBU buffer <b>2400</b> receives the VODI data on the top of interleave unit ILVU. As a result, the NV extractor <b>2406</b> can extracts the data of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_SA at the same time with the inputting of navigation pack data NV, and outputs thereof as signal St<b>2452</b> (St<b>63</b>) to the decode system controller <b>2300</b> (FIG. 26). </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0692\" num=\"0692\">[0692] The decode system controller <b>2300</b> stores the signal St<b>2452</b> into the ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and then start to counts the number of packs based on the pack terminating signal <b>2452</b> from the data counter <b>2408</b>. Based on the fore mentioned the counted value of packs and ILVU_EA_reg, the decode system controller <b>2300</b> detects the instance when the inputting of final pack data of ILVU is completed, or the inputting final byte data of the final pack of the ILVU is completed. Then, the controller <b>2300</b> further give a command for the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> to move to the position having a sector address indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg. The bitstream producer <b>2000</b> moves to the sector address indicated NT_ILVU_SA_reg, and starts to read the data. Thus, the detection of final end of ILVU and reading process for the next ILVU can be performed effectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0693\" num=\"0693\">[0693] In the above, an example where the multimedia data MBS is reproduced by the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> without a buffering process, and is inputted to the stream buffer <b>2499</b>. However, in the case that the signal processor <b>2008</b> of the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> is incorporated with a buffer for error correction process, for example, the controller <b>2300</b> gives a moving command to reproducer <b>2000</b> so that the reproducer <b>2000</b> moves to the reading position indicated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg after completion of the final pack data of fore mentioned ILVU and clearing the internal buffer of the reproducer <b>2000</b>. Thus, the effective reproduction of ILVU data even when the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> includes a buffer for error correction code (ECC) process. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0694\" num=\"0694\">[0694] Furthermore, when the bitstream producer <b>2000</b> has a buffer for ECC process, the data can be transferred effectively by providing any means having a function equivalent to that of data counter <b>2408</b> (FIG. 69). In other words, the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> generates the pack input completion signal St<b>62</b>; the decode system controller <b>2300</b> gives a command based on the signal St<b>62</b> the bitstream reproducer <b>200</b> to move to the reading position having sector address designated by NT_ILVU_SA_reg. As apparent from the above, the data can be transferred effectively even when the bitstream reproducer <b>2000</b> has a function to buffer the data reproduced from the recording media M. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0695\" num=\"0695\">[0695] It is to be noted that the apparatus and method substantially the same as those described in the above with respect to the interleave unit ILVU can be used for the detection VOBU end. In other words, by replacing the extraction of ILVU_EA and NT_ILVU_Sa, and the storing of ILVU_EA_reg and NT_ILVU_SA_reg with the extraction of VOBU_EA and storing VOBU_EA_reg, the apparatus and method according to the present invention, described above, can be used for the detection of unatend. This is effective for the VOBU data transferring operations shown at steps #<b>31074</b>, #<b>31082</b>, #<b>31092</b>, and #<b>31102</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0696\" num=\"0696\">[0696] Thus, the reading of data such as ILVU and VOBU can be performed effectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0697\" num=\"0697\">[0697] Decoding Process in the Stream Buffer </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0698\" num=\"0698\">[0698] The process for decoding data in the stream buffer <b>2400</b> shown as step #<b>31034</b> in FIG. 57 is described below referring to FIG. 58. This process (step #<b>31034</b>) comprises steps #<b>31110</b>, #<b>31112</b>, #<b>31114</b>, and #<b>31116</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0699\" num=\"0699\">[0699] At step #<b>31110</b> data is transferred in pack units from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> to the system decoder <b>2500</b> (FIG. 26). The procedure then moves to step #<b>31112</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0700\" num=\"0700\">[0700] At step #<b>31112</b> the pack data is from the stream buffer <b>2400</b> to each of the buffers, i.e., the video buffer <b>2600</b>, sub-picture buffer <b>2700</b>, and audio buffer <b>2800</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0701\" num=\"0701\">[0701] At step #<b>31112</b> the Ids of the user-selected audio and sub-picture data, i.e., the audio ID AUDIO_ID_reg and the sub-picture ID SP_ID_reg stored to the scenario information register shown in FIG. 54, are compared with the stream ID and sub-stream ID read from the packet header (FIG. 19), and the matching packets are output to the respective buffers. The procedure then moves to step #<b>31114</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0702\" num=\"0702\">[0702] The decode timing of the respective decoders (video, sub-picture, and audio decoders) is controlled in step #<b>31114</b>, i.e., the decoding operations of the decoders are synchronized, and the procedure moves to step #<b>31116</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0703\" num=\"0703\">[0703] The respective elementary strings are then decoded at step #<b>31116</b>. The video decoder <b>3801</b> thus reads and decodes the data from the video buffer, the sub-picture decoder <b>3100</b> reads and decodes the data from the sub-picture buffer, and the audio decoder <b>3200</b> reads and decodes the data from the audio buffer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0704\" num=\"0704\">[0704] This stream buffer data decoding process then terminates when these decoding processes are completed. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0705\" num=\"0705\">[0705] The decoder synchronization process of step #<b>31114</b>, FIG. 58, is described below with reference to FIG. 59. This processes comprises steps #<b>31120</b>, #<b>31122</b>, and #<b>31124</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0706\" num=\"0706\">[0706] At step #<b>31120</b> it is determined whether a seamless connection is specified between the current cell and the preceding cell. If a seamless connection, the procedure moves to step #<b>31122</b>, if not, the procedure moves to step #<b>31124</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0707\" num=\"0707\">[0707] A process synchronizing operation for producing seamless connections is executed in step #<b>31122</b>, and a process synchronizing operation for non-seamless connections is executed in step #<b>31124</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0708\" num=\"0708\">[0708] To achieve seamless multi-scene reproduction control, it is necessary to seamlessly reproduce the connections between VOB. Except when a VOB, which is normally a single-stream title editing unit, is divided into discrete streams, however, there is no contiguity between the SCR and PTS at the connection. The problems relating to reproducing VOB of which the SCR and PTS are not contiguous are described below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0709\" num=\"0709\">[0709] Note that the presentation time stamp PTS declaring the video presentation start time is referenced below as the VPTS, the decoding time stamp DTS declaring the video decode start time is referenced as VDTS, and the presentation time stamp PTS declaring the audio reproduction, or presentation, start time is referenced as APTS below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0710\" num=\"0710\">[0710] The relationship between the SCR APTS, and VPTS values and recording positions in the VOB are shown in FIG. 47 and described below. For simplification this description is limited to the SCR and PTS parameters. The top SCR value is recorded with the PTS to both the middle audio stream and bottom video stream. If the positions on the horizontal axis are approximately the same, approximately the same SCR value is recorded to each stream. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0711\" num=\"0711\">[0711] Tse is the time indicated by the SCR of the last pack in the VOB; Tve is the time indicated by the VPTS of the last video pack in the VOB; Tae is the time indicated by the APTS of the last audio pack in the VOB; Tvd is the video decode buffer delay time; and Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0712\" num=\"0712\">[0712]FIG. 48 is a time line from input of the VOB shown in FIG. 47 to the system decoder to output of the last audio and video reproduction data. The horizontal axis shows the passage of time t, and the vertical axis shows the SCR value, which indicates the time transfer should be accomplished, and the PTS values, which indicate the time reproduction should be accomplished. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0713\" num=\"0713\">[0713] Both audio and video outputs are thus delayed by the respective decode buffers referenced to the system clock reference SCR, and while the audio and video data are input substantially simultaneously, the video data is reproduced at a slight delay after the audio data. This delay is caused by the difference in the video and audio decode buffer delay times. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0714\" num=\"0714\">[0714] In addition, when two VOB are connected, there is no contiguity between the SCR and PTS at the connection except when a single-stream VOB is split into separate streams. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0715\" num=\"0715\">[0715] Contiguous reproduction of VOB #<b>1</b> and VOB #<b>2</b> having non-contiguous SCR and PTS parameters is described below referring to FIG. 46. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0716\" num=\"0716\">[0716]FIG. 46 also shows the relationship between the SCR, APTS, and VPTS values and recording positions in each VOB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0717\" num=\"0717\">[0717] The system clock reference SCR is time information indicating the pack transfer time, and is recorded with each pack; APTS is the audio playback starting time information recorded with each audio packet; and VPTS is the video playback starting time information recorded with each video packet. The system clock STC is a reference clock for decoder synchronization control. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0718\" num=\"0718\">[0718] Tsel is the time indicated by the SCR of the last pack in VOB #<b>1</b>; Tael is the time indicated by the last APTS in VOB #<b>1</b>; and Tvel is the time indicated by the last VPTS in VOB #<b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0719\" num=\"0719\">[0719] Tad is the audio decode buffer delay time; Tvd is the video decode buffer delay time; and the horizontal axis indicates the passage of time t. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0720\" num=\"0720\">[0720] What is important to note here is that synchronizing the audio and video so that the reproduced audio and video signals are output at the time the system clock STC equals the APTS and VPTS values in the stream. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0721\" num=\"0721\">[0721] To maintain the reference clock for transferring VOB to the system decoder, the first system clock reference SCR value in VOB #<b>2</b> must be set to the STC initializer at precisely time Tse<b>1</b>. However, because reproduction and output of VOB #<b>1</b> have not been completed at this time point, the audio and video still to be output from VOB #<b>1</b> after time Tse<b>1</b> cannot be normally reproduced because the reference clock is lost. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0722\" num=\"0722\">[0722] Furthermore, even if the SCR value of the STC initializer is set at the audio end time Tae<b>1</b>, i.e., later than the system clock reference SCR time Tse<b>1</b>, the reference clock at which the first pack in VOB #<b>2</b> should be transferred is lost, and the reference clock for the VOB #<b>1</b> video output to be reproduced after time Tae<b>1</b> is lost. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0723\" num=\"0723\">[0723] The same problem also occurs if the system clock reference SCR is set to the STC initializer at time Tve<b>1</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0724\" num=\"0724\">[0724] When there is a one-to-one correspondence between the VOB reproduced first, i.e., the first VOB, and the VOB reproduced thereafter, i.e., the second VOB, this problem can be avoided by assuring that the first SCR value of the second VOB is contiguous to the last SCR of the first VOB. However, when common data is shared between plural titles, there is a many-to-one relationship between the first VOB and the many VOB that may be reproduced thereafter. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0725\" num=\"0725\">[0725] When contiguously reproducing a second VOB #<b>2</b> following a first VOB #<b>1</b>, it is therefore necessary to destroy any remaining VOB #<b>1</b> data in the decode buffer at time Tsel, and seamless reproduction in which the audio and video are not intermitted is not possible. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0726\" num=\"0726\">[0726] A method(s) for seamlessly reproducing VOB of which the SCR and PTS are not contiguous is described by means of the two embodiments of the invention below. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0727\" num=\"0727\">[0727] Synchronization Controller: Embodiment 1 </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0728\" num=\"0728\">[0728] A first embodiment of the synchronizer <b>2900</b> shown in FIG. 26 is described according to the present invention with reference to FIG. 32 below.

As shown in FIG. 41, the synchronizer <b>2900</b> comprises a system clock STC generator <b>32030</b>, PTS/DTS extractor <b>32031</b>, synchronization controller <b>32032</b>, video decoder synchronizer <b>32033</b>, sub-picture decoder synchronizer <b>32034</b>, audio decoder synchronizer <b>32035</b>, and system decoder synchronizer <b>32036</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0774\" num=\"0774\">[0774] The STC generator <b>32030</b> generates the system clock for each decoder, and supplies the synchronization system clock STC to the video decoder synchronizer <b>32033</b>, sub-picture decoder synchronizer <b>32034</b>, audio decoder synchronizer <b>32035</b>, and system decoder synchronizer <b>32036</b>. The STC generator <b>32030</b> is a counter that operates at the system clock. The SCR from the first pack in the first VOB in the program chain PGC is set as the initial counter value, and is thereafter-incremented based on the system clock. Note that the initial STC counter value may be reset to the APTS or VPTS value. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0775\" num=\"0775\">[0775] Both the audio and video outputs are reproduced synchronized to the respective output clocks. It is therefore possible for synchronization to be disrupted by the accumulated error in STC, audio output clock, and video output clock precision. When this accumulated error becomes great, the respective decoder buffers may be destroyed (by a data underflow or overflow state). Therefore, by periodically resetting the system clock STC to the APTS synchronized to the audio output clock, for example, APTS-STC error accumulation can be prevented, and the audio can be reproduced without interruption. In this case, video synchronization is controlled by skipping or freezing video output. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0776\" num=\"0776\">[0776] This type of synchronization control is defined as Audio Master synchronization control. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0777\" num=\"0777\">[0777] On the other hand, by periodically resetting the system clock STC to the VPTS synchronized to the video output clock, VPTS-STC error accumulation can be prevented, and the video can be seamlessly reproduced. In this case, audio synchronization is controlled by skipping or pausing audio output. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0778\" num=\"0778\">[0778] This type of synchronization control is defined as Video Master synchronization control. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0779\" num=\"0779\">[0779] In the following description of synchronization control, an ON synchronization mode refers to STC-referenced synchronization, control, either Audio or Video Master. An OFF synchronization mode is when STC-referenced synchronization control is not applied. In an OFF synchronization mode the audio and video decoders sequentially output the audio and video at a defined frame frequency based on the respective internal reference clocks without referencing the time stamp values from the streams, and no timing control is applied to synchronize the audio and video. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0780\" num=\"0780\">[0780] The PTS/DTS extractor <b>32031</b> extracts the presentation time stamp PTS and decoding time stamp DTS from the synchronization control data St<b>81</b>, and supplies the PTS and DTS to the respective decoder synchronizers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0781\" num=\"0781\">[0781] The synchronization controller <b>32032</b> generates the synchronization control signal specifying an ON or OFF synchronization mode for each of the decoder synchronizers.

The system clock St<b>79</b> is used to control pack transfers from the stream buffers to the system decoder. In other words, if the STC value matches the SCR value in the pack, the pack data is transferred from the stream buffer to the system decoder. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0789\" num=\"0789\">[0789] The structure and operation of the synchronization controller <b>32032</b> are described below with reference to FIG. 42 and FIG. 43. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0790\" num=\"0790\">[0790] The structure of the synchronization controller <b>32032</b> is shown in FIG. 42.

By thus setting the SCR to 0 in the first pack of the VOB reproduced later when seamlessly connecting and reproducing two VOB, the VOB break point can be easily detected. Note that the SCR is not set to 0 when an originally contiguous VOB is divided in two, i.e., when the SCR is contiguous between two VOB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0792\" num=\"0792\">[0792] Note, further, that while a 0 value is described here, any value whereby the beginning and end of each VOB can be easily determined can be used. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0793\" num=\"0793\">[0793] In the case of parental lock control, for example, when a single stream, e.g., VOB #<b>2</b>, is reconnected to one of plural possible scenes, e.g., VOB #<b>1</b>, from the multi-scene period enabling parental lock control, each of the VOB in the multi-scene period may have a different reproduction time, and it is not possible to assign the first SCR value in each possible VOB #<b>2</b> to account for all possible connections. A seamless can be achieved in such cases, however, by setting the SCR of the first pack in VOB #<b>2</b> to 0. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0794\" num=\"0794\">[0794] The APTS changing time detector <b>32041</b> compares the APTS in the synchronization control data St<b>81</b> when the VOB changes with the STC counter value supplied from the STC generator <b>32030</b> shown in FIG. 41.

If the first SCR is not 0, e.g., if normal reproduction is resumed from the middle of a VOB after a special reproduction mode, the control procedure is the same. The times between input and output of the audio data and video data, respectively, to and from the system decoder are expressed as DTad and DTvd. Because DTad&lt;DTvd, and data is recorded at the VOB beginning referenced to the time it is reproduced, only video data is present at point C at the VOB start, and the audio data is recorded at point D after a delay of DTvd-DTad. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0809\" num=\"0809\">[0809] Synchronization is controlled at this point as described below. Video and audio output is first stopped, the SCR value from the pack at point A is set to the STC generator <b>32030</b>, and the STC generator <b>32030</b> operates an internal counter at the system clock and outputs the system clock STC. Transfer of the first pack in the VOB to the system decoder <b>2500</b> starts at the same time. The following packs are transferred at the SCR recorded in the pack header of each pack referenced to the system clock STC produced by the STC generator <b>32030</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0810\" num=\"0810\">[0810] The first video data is then decoded, and video output starts at point F when the STC output from the STC generator <b>32030</b> matches the first VPTS value. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0811\" num=\"0811\">[0811] Audio output is similarly controlled: the first audio data is decoded, and audio output starts at point E, the moment when the STC output from the STC generator <b>32030</b> matches the first APTS value. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0812\" num=\"0812\">[0812] After reproduction of the start of the VOB thus begins, the audio APTS value is periodically set to the STC generator <b>32030</b> to control synchronization under Audio Master or Video Master control. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0813\" num=\"0813\">[0813] The method of synchronizing seamless reproduction of two VOB is described next. The detection method of the SCR change detector <b>32040</b>, APTS changing time detector <b>32041</b>, and VPTS changing time detector <b>32042</b> in FIG. 42 is particularly described with reference to FIG. 45. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0814\" num=\"0814\">[0814]FIG. 45 shows the relationship between the recording positions and values of SCR, APTS, and VPTS when VOB #<b>1</b> and VOB #<b>2</b> are seamlessly reproduced. Why the synchronization mode of the decoder synchronizers must be switched ON and OFF to achieve seamless reproduction is described first. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0815\" num=\"0815\">[0815] Point G is the time at which the pack being transferred changes from VOB #<b>1</b> to VOB #<b>2</b>, H is the time the audio output changes, and I is the time the video output changes. Because the audio output and video output thus change at different times, synchronization control cannot be achieved using a single system clock STC. It is therefore necessary to prevent synchronization control using the STC during the period from when the SCR changes at time G to when both the APTS and VPTS have changed at time I. After both the APTS and VPTS have changed at time I, synchronization control using the STC is again possible and necessary. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0816\" num=\"0816\">[0816] The method of detecting the timing at which synchronization control is stopped, i.e., when the synchronization mode is turned OFF, is described next. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0817\" num=\"0817\">[0817] The timing at which the synchronization mode is turned OFF is obtained from the SCR time chart in FIG. 45. VOB #<b>1</b> is being output to the system decoder while the SCR value increases, and SCR becomes 0 only at time G, i.e., when VOB #<b>1</b> transfer stops and VOB #<b>2</b> transfer begins. Therefore, by detecting the time at which the SCR value becomes 0, it is known that VOB #<b>2</b> is being input to the system decoder, and the synchronization mode is therefore set OFF at this time Tg. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0818\" num=\"0818\">[0818] It is also possible to detect that the SCR is 0 when the value is written to the stream buffer. The synchronization mode can also be set OFF when a 0 SCR value is detected written to the stream buffer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0819\" num=\"0819\">[0819] The timing at which synchronization control begins, i.e., when the synchronization mode is turned from OFF to ON, is described next. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0820\" num=\"0820\">[0820] To start synchronization control it is necessary to know when both the audio and video output have switched from VOB #<b>1</b> to VOB #<b>2</b>. The moment when the audio output changes to VOB #<b>2</b> can be known by detecting the point H at which the APTS value stops increasing. Likewise, the moment when the video output changes to VOB #<b>2</b> can be known by detecting the point I at which the VPTS value stops increasing. After both points H and I have appeared, the synchronization mode is immediately set ON at time Ti. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0821\" num=\"0821\">[0821] The timing at which the synchronization mode is set OFF can also be delayed to a time between time Tg and time Ti, rather than at time Tg when an SCR change is detected. By setting the synchronization mode OFF at time Th, i.e., the time at which a change in APTS or VPTS is detected, between Tg and Ti, the duration of the OFF synchronization mode can be shortened. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0822\" num=\"0822\">[0822] However, when the timing is based on detecting whether both APTS and VPTS values continue increasing, it is clear that both APTS and VPTS values must decrease when VOB are connected. In other words, the last APTS and VPTS values in a VOB must be greater than the maximum initial APTS and VPTS values in a VOB. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0823\" num=\"0823\">[0823] The maximum initial (DTad and DTvd) APTS and VPTS values are defined as follows. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0824\" num=\"0824\">[0824] The initial APTS and VPTS values are the sums of the video data and audio data storage times in the video and audio buffers, and the video reordering time (in MPEG. video, the picture decode order and presentation order are not necessarily the same, and presentation is delayed a maximum one picture from the decoder). Therefore, the sum of the time required for the video buffer and audio buffer to fill, and the presentation delay (1 frame period) from video reordering, determines the maximum initial values for APTS and VPTS. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0825\" num=\"0825\">[0825] As a result, the last APTS and VPTS values in a VOB are always assigned to exceed these maximum initial values when the VOB are produced. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0826\" num=\"0826\">[0826] While it is possible to control the timing at which the synchronization mode is turned ON following VOB connection by detecting whether both APTS and VPTS values continue increasing, it is also possible to achieve the same synchronization control by detecting the time at which the APTS value drops below an APTS threshold value, and the VPTS value drops below an VPTS threshold value. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0827\" num=\"0827\">[0827] These APTS and VPTS threshold values can be calculated by using values equal to the maximum initial APTS and VPTS values of the VOB as the threshold values, and calculating them as described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0828\" num=\"0828\">[0828] By applying ON/OFF synchronization mode control as described above, seamless reproduction that does not disturb the playback condition can be achieved in VOB connections. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0829\" num=\"0829\">[0829] Note that various methods can be used in the reproduction apparatus for audio and video synchronization control in the second embodiment described above. The most common of these methods (1) is to reset the system clock STC to the APTS value every few seconds, determine whether the VPTS value is fast or slow referenced to the system clock STC, and freeze or skip video output as necessary. This is the so-called Audio Master method described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0830\" num=\"0830\">[0830] Alternatively, it is also possible (2) to reset the system clock STC to the VPTS value every few seconds, determine whether the APTS value is fast or slow referenced to the system clock STC, and freeze or skip audio output as necessary. This is the so-called Video Master method described above. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0831\" num=\"0831\">[0831] Another method (3) is to directly compare the APTS and VPTS values, and use either the APTS or VPTS value for reference. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0832\" num=\"0832\">[0832] Regardless of which method is used for ON/OFF synchronization mode control, however, the same effect can be achieved. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0833\" num=\"0833\">[0833] As described above, two methods are used for audio-video synchronization according to the present embodiment, Audio Master and Video Master synchronization control. For Audio Master synchronization control the system clock STC is periodically reset to the APTS value, whether the VPTS value is earlier or later is determined referenced to the reset system clock STC, and the video presentation is frozen or skipped as necessary for synchronization. For Video Master synchronization control the system clock STC is periodically reset to the VPTS value, whether the APTS value is earlier or later is determined referenced to the reset system clock STC, and the audio presentation is paused or skipped as necessary for synchronization. It is also possible to directly compare the APTS and VPTS values, and control synchronization referenced to either the APTS or VPTS value. Regardless of which method is used for AV synchronization control, however, the same effects can be obtained. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0834\" num=\"0834\">[0834] Furthermore, while the above embodiments have been described using an initial VOB SCR value of 0, a value other than 0 can be used and the same control achieved by adding the first SCR value as an offset value to the APTS and VPTS values. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0835\" num=\"0835\">[0835] It is also possible in the second embodiment above to read the STC discontinuity flag STCDCF_reg, which specifies whether the next cell reproduced needs the STC to be reset. If the register reads STC_NRESET, the synchronization mode is constantly ON; if STC_RESET is stored, ON/OFF synchronization mode control can be applied. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0836\" num=\"0836\">[0836] It is thus possible to decode the data transferred to the stream buffer <b>2400</b> while synchronizing the operation of the various decoders. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0837\" num=\"0837\">[0837] It is therefore possible by means of the present invention thus described to maintain synchronization between the audio and video data, and seamlessly connect and reproduce two VOB during reproduction from a multi-scene period even when there is no continuity between the system clock reference SCR and presentation time stamp PTS values used for synchronization control of the VOB to be contiguously reproduced. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0838\" num=\"0838\">[0838] Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom. </p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

PC11712, PC11848, PC11893, PC11895, PC11896, and PC11897, which involve other classes of nicotinamide derivatives useful as inhibitors of PDE4 isozymes. The disclosures of all of said copending applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.  \\n       2.0 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0004] The 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a large class of enzymes divided into at least eleven different families which are structurally, biochemically and pharmacologically distinct from one another. The enzymes within each family are commonly referred to as isoenzymes, or isozymes. A total of more than fifteen gene products is included within this class, and further diversity results from differential splicing and post-translational processing of those gene products. The present invention is primarily concerned with the four gene products of the fourth family of PDEs, i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. These enzymes are collectively referred to as being isoforms or subtypes of the PDE4 isozyme family. Further below will be found a more detailed discussion of the genomic organization, molecular structure and enzymatic activity, differential splicing, transcriptional regulation and phosphorylation, distribution and expression, and selective inhibition of the PDE4 isozyme subtypes.  \\n       [0005] The PDE4s are characterized by selective, high affinity hydrolytic degradation of the second messenger cyclic nucleotide, adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and by sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. A number of selective inhibitors of the PDE4s have been discovered in recent years, and beneficial pharmacological effects resulting from that inhibition have been shown in a variety of disease models. See, e.g., Torphy et al.,  Environ. Health Perspect.  102 Suppl. 10, 79-84, 1994; Duplantier et al.,  J. Med. Chem.  39 120-125, 1996; Schneider et al.,  Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.  50 211-217, 1995; Banner and Page,  Br. J. Pharmacol.  114 93-98, 1995; Barnette et al.,  J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.  273 674-679, 1995; Wright et al. \u201cDifferential in vivo and in vitro bronchorelaxant activities of CP-80633, a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor,\u201d  Can. J. Physiol.

Med. Chem.  42 1088-1099, 1999. Accordingly, there continues to be considerable interest in the art with regard to the discovery of further selective inhibitors of PDE4s.  \\n       [0006] The present invention is also concerned with the use of selective PDE4 inhibitors for the improved therapeutic treatment of a number of inflammatory, respiratory and allergic diseases and conditions, but especially for the treatment of asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and bronchiectasis; chronic rhinitis; and chronic sinusitis. Heretofore in the art, however, the first-line therapy for treatment of asthma and other obstructive airway diseases has been the nonselective PDE inhibitor theophylline, as well as pentoxifylline and IBMX, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.1), (0.0.2), and (0.0.3), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0007] Theophylline, which has the PDEs as one of its biochemical targets, in addition to its well characterized bronchodilatory activity, affects the vasculature of patients with increased pulmonary artery pressure, suppresses inflammatory cell responses, and induces apoptosis of eosinophils. Theophylline&#39;s adverse events, most commonly cardiac dysrhythmias and nausea, are also mediated by PDE inhibition, however, leading to the search for more selective inhibitors of PDEs that are able to suppress both immune cell functions in vitro and allergic pulmonary inflammation in vivo, while at the same time having improved side-effect profiles. Within the airways of patients suffering from asthma and other obstructive airway diseases, PDE4 is the most important of the PDE isozymes as a target for drug discovery because of its distribution in airway smooth muscle and inflammatory cells. Several PDE4 inhibitors introduced to the art thus far have been designed to have an improved therapeutic index concerning the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system side effects of the above-mentioned nonselective xanthines.  \\n       [0008] Airflow obstruction and airway inflammation are features of asthma as well as COPD. While bronchial asthma is predominantly characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation, neutrophils appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Thus, PDEs that are involved in smooth muscle relaxation and are also found in eosinophils as well as neutrophils probably constitute an essential element of the progress of both diseases. The PDEs involved include PDE3s as well as PDE4s, and bronchodilating inhibitors have been discovered which are selective PDE3 inhibitors and dual PDE3/4 selective inhibitors. Examples of these are milrinone, a selective PDE3 inhibitor, as well as zardaverine and benafentrine, both dual PDE3/4 selective inhibitors, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.4), (0.0.5), and (0.0.6), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0009] However, benafentrine results in bronchodilation only when administered by inhalation, and zardaverine produces only a modest and short-lived bronchodilation. Milrinone, a cardiotonic agent, induces short-lived bronchodilation and a slight degree of protection against induced bronchoconstriction, but has marked adverse events, e.g., tachycardia and hypotension. Unsatisfactory results have also been obtained with a weakly selective PDE4 inhibitor, tibenelast, and a selective PDE5 inhibitor, zaprinast, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.7) and (0.0.8):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0010] More relative success has been obtained in the art with the discovery and development of selective PDE4 inhibitors.  \\n       [0011] In vivo, PDE4 inhibitors reduce the influx of eosinophils to the lungs of allergen-challenged animals while also reducing the bronchoconstriction and elevated bronchial responsiveness occurring after allergen challenge. PDE4 inhibitors also suppress the activity of immune cells, including CD4 +  T-lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells, and basophils; reduce pulmonary edema; inhibit excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission (eNANC); potentiate inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission (iNANC); reduce airway smooth muscle mitogenesis; and induce bronchodilation. PDE4 inhibitors also suppress the activity of a number of inflammatory cells associated with the pathophysiology of COPD, including monocytes/macrophages, CD8 +  T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils. PDE4 inhibitors also reduce vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis and, and potentially interfere with the ability of airway epithelial cells to generate pro-inflammatory mediators. Through the release of neutral proteases and acid hydrolases from their granules, and the generation of reactive oxygen species, neutrophils contribute to the tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammation, and are further implicated in the pathology of conditions such as emphysema.  \\n       [0012] Selective PDE4 inhibitors which have been discovered thus far that provide therapeutic advantages include SB-207,499, identified as ARIFLO\u00ae, which may be represented by Formula (0.1.9):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0013] SB-207,499, administered orally at dosages of 5, 10, and 15 mg b.i.d., has produced significant increases in trough FEV, (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) from placebo at week 2 of a study involving a large number of patients. Another potent, selective PDE4 inhibitor, CDP840, has shown suppression of late reactions to inhaled allergen after 9.5 days of oral administration at doses of 15 and 30 mg in a group of patients with bronchial asthma. CDP840 may be represented by Formula (0.0.9):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0014] PDEs have also been investigated as potential therapy for obstructive lung disease, including COPD. In a large study of SB-207,499 in patients with COPD, the group of patients receiving 15 mg b.id. has experienced a progressive improvement in trough FEV 1 , reaching a maximum mean difference compared with placebo of 160 mL at week 6, which represents an 11% improvement. See Compton et al., \u201cThe efficacy of Ariflo (SB207499), a second generation, oral PDE4 inhibitor, in patients with COPD,\u201d  Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.  159, 1999. Patients with severe COPD have been observed to have pulmonary hypertension, and decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure under clinical conditions have been achieved by oral administration of the selective PDE3 inhibitors milrinone and enoximone. Enoximone has also been shown to reduce airway resistance in patients hospitalized with decompensated COPD. See Leeman et al.,  Chest  91 662-6, 1987. Using selective PDE3 inhibition by motapizone and selective PDE5 inhibition by zaprinast, it has been shown that combined inhibition of PDE 3 and 5 exerts a relaxation of pulmonary artery rings which corresponds broadly to the pattern of PDE isozymes found in the pulmonary artery smooth muscle. See Rabe et al.,  Am. J. Physiol.  266 (LCMP 10): L536-L543, 1994. The structures of milrinone and zaprinast are shown above as Formulas (0.0.4) and (0.0.8), respectively The structures of enoximone and motapizone may be represented by Formulas (0.0.10) and (0.0.11), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0015] The effects of PDE4 inhibitors on various inflammatory cell responses can be used as a basis for profiling and selecting inhibitors for further study. These effects include elevation of cAMP and inhibition of superoxide production, degranulation, chemotaxis, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) release in eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes. PDE4 inhibitors may induce emesis, Le., nausea and vomiting, which, as expected, is an adverse effect. The emesis adverse effect became apparent when PDE4 inhibitors were first investigated for CNS indications such as depression, when rolipram and denbufylline were used in clinical trials. Rolipram and denbufylline may be represented by Formulas (0.0.12) and (0.0.13), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0016] The mechanism(s) by which PDE4 inhibitors may potentially induce emesis is/are uncertain, but a study of the PDE4 inhibitor Ro-20-1724 suggests that nausea and vomiting are at least partially mediated by the emesis centers in the brain. Gastrointestinal adverse events may be caused by local effects, e.g., rolipram is a very potent stimulator of acid secretion from gastric parietal cells, and the resulting excess acid, by producing local irritation, may exacerbate gastrointestinal disturbances. Ro-20-1724 may be represented by Formula (0.0.14):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0017] Efforts to minimize or eliminate the above-mentioned adverse events sometimes associated with PDE4 inhibitors have included creating inhibitors which do not penetrate the central nervous system, and administering PDE4 inhibitors by inhalation rather than orally.  \\n       [0018] With regard to the PDE4 subtypes, A, B, C, and D, it has been found that PDE4C is usually less sensitive to all inhibitors; whereas, with respect to the subtypes A, B, and D, there is as yet no clear evidence of inhibitor specificity, which is defined as a 10-fold difference in IC 50  values. While most inhibitors, especially RS-25,344, are more potent against PDE4D, this does not amount to selectivity. RS-25,344 may be represented by Formula (0.0.15):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0019] On the other hand, there is a stereoselective effect on the elevation of cAMP in a range of cell types, which has been demonstrated with the results of an investigation of CDP840, shown above as Formula (0.0.9), and its less active enantiomer CT-1731, which is represented by Formula (0.0.16):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0020] It has been known for some time that rolipram had the ability to interact with a high-affinity binding site on brain membranes, and it was later established in the art that this high-affinity rolipram binding site (S r ), which is distinct from the catalytic site (S c ), exists in a truncated recombinant PDE4A and a full-length recombinant PDE4B. More recently, S r  has been identified on all four PDE4 subtypes. See Hughes et al.,  Drug Discovery Today  2(3) 89-101, 1997. The presence of S r  appears to have a profound effect on the ability of certain inhibitors such as rolipram and RS-25,344 to inhibit the catalytic activity of PDE4 isozymes.  \\n       [0021] The impact of residues on inhibitor binding is also significant. A single amino acid substitution (alanine for aspartate) in the catalytic region of PDE4B has been shown to be critical for inhibition by rolipram, and this appears to be a class effect because related inhibitors RP-73,401 and Ro-20-1724 also lose potency on the mutant enzyme. However, the role of binding of inhibitors to the S c  or to the S r , in terms of elevation of cAMP and inhibition of cell responses, is not fully understood at the present time.  \\n       [0022] RP-73,401, in guinea-pig studies, has been found to be active in (1) the inhibition of antigen-induced lung eosinophilia and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), Banner, K.

Filaminast may be represented by Formula (0.0.19):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0025] It has been suggested in the art that PDE4 inhibitors that have a high affinity at the S r  can be correlated with emesis and increased gastric acid secretion. RS-23,544, RP-73,401, and CP-80,633 elicit emesis and have a high affinity at the S r . CDP840 and SB-207,499 have a comparatively low affinity at the S r , but CDP840 has a significantly higher potency at the S c  than does SB-207,499. CDP840 has been demonstrated to provide significant inhibition of late-phase response in the treatment of asthma without any adverse events of nausea or headache. Another PDE4 inhibitor that has been shown to have adverse events of nausea and vomiting is BRL-61,063, also referred to as cipamfylline, which is described further below. The development of CDP840 has been discontinued, while CP-80,633, atizoram, has been advanced into clinical studies. CP-80,633 and BRL-61,063 may be represented by Formulas  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0026] Another compound which is in development is LAS-31025, arofylline, which in guinea-pig studies, has been found to be active in the inhibition of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction; Beleta, B.

LAS-31025, arofylline, may be represented by Formula (0.0.21):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0027] A number of PDE4 inhibitors have been advanced in development. For example, the effects of V-1 1294A on LPS-stimulated ex vivo TNF release and PHA induced lymphocyte proliferation have been determined in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study which has found that an oral dose of 300 mg is effective in reducing TNF levels and lymphocyte proliferation; Landells et al., \u201cOral administration of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitor, V11294A inhibits ex-vivo agonist-induced cell activation,\u201d  Eur.

J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.  159 A108, 1999. D4418 is a moderately potent PDE4 inhibitor with an IC 50  of 200 nM. It has good oral absorption; a 200 mg dose provides a plasma C max  of 1.4 \u03bcg/ml. D4418 has been discontinued from development due to its moderate potency, and has been replaced by the preclinical development candidate D4396.  \\n       [0029] V-11294A and D4418 may be represented by Formulas (0.0.22) and (0.0.23), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0030] Another compound, CI-1018, has been evaluated in 54 subjects and no adverse events were reported at doses up to 400 mg; Pruniaux et al., \u201cThe novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor CI-1018 inhibits antigen-induced lung eosinophilia in sensitized brown-norway rats\u2014comparison with rolipram,\u201d  Inflammation  S-04-6, 1999. CI-1018 has been demonstrated to have good oral bioavailability (57% in the rat) and good oral potency of with an ED 50  of 5 mg/kg in that same species. CI-1018 is a relatively weak PDE4 inhibitor with an IC 50  of 1.1\u03bcM in U937 cells. CI-1018 has also been identified as, or associated with as closely related in structure to, PD-168787, which in rat studies has been demonstrated to have activity in the inhibition of antigen-induced eosinophilia; Pascal et al., \u201cSynthesis and structure-activity relationships of 4-oxo-1-phenyl-3,4,6,7-tetrahydro-[1,4]-diazepino[6,7,1-hi] indolines: novel PDE4 inhibitors,\u201d 215 th    ACS , Dallas, USA, MEDI 50, 1998. Inferred structures for CI-1018 and PD-168787 belong to a diazepinone class whose nucleus may be represented by Formula (0.0.24):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0031] The above-mentioned compounds have also been evaluated in animal models which demonstrate their PDE4 inhibition activity. For example, V-11294A, in guinea-pig studies, has been found to be active in the inhibition of antigen-induced bronchoconstriction; Cavalla et al., \u201cActivity of V 11294A, a novel phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor, in cellular and animal models of asthma,\u201d  Amer. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med,  155 A660, 1997.

Med. Chem. Letts. 8 2669-2674, 1998.  \\n       [0035] CDC-801 is from a series of compounds based on thalidomide and has been developed primarily to improve the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitory activity of thalidomide for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Thalidomide may be represented by Formula (0.0.33):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0036] CDC-801 has also been studied for the treatment of Crohn&#39;s disease, a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology commonly involving the terminal ileum, with scarring and thickening of the bowel wall which frequently leads to intestinal obstruction and fistula and abscess formation. Crohn&#39;s disease has a high rate of recurrence after treatment.  \\n       [0037] YM-58997 has an IC 50  value of 1.2 nM against PDE4; Takayama et al., \u201cSynthetic studies on selective Type IV phosphodiesterase (PDE IV) inhibitors,\u201d 214 th    American Chemical Society , Las Vegas, USA, MEDI 245, 1997. YM-58997 has a 1,8-naphthyridin-2-one structure, as does YM-976.  \\n       [0038] Roflumilast has been studied for the treatment of both COPD and asthma, and has an IC 50  value of 3.5 nM in standard in vitro guinea-pig models of asthma. The use of roflumilast and a surfactant for the treatment of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has also been described.  \\n       [0039] AWD-12,281, which is now designated as loteprednol, has been shown to be active in a rat model of allergic rhinitis, as described further below in a section which deals with allergic rhinitis and the use of PDE4 inhibitors to treat it. AWD-12,281 may be represented by Formula (0.0.34):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0040] Compounds related in structure to CDP840, shown further above as Formula (0.0.9), include L-826,141, which has been reported to have activity in a rat model of bronchitis; Gordon et al., \u201cAnti-inflammatory effects of a PDE4 inhibitor in a rat model of chronic bronchitis,\u201d  Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med.  159 A33, 1999 Another such compound is related in structure to those reported in Perrier et al., \u201cSubstituted furans as inhibitors of the PDE4 enzyme,\u201d  Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letts.  9 323-326, 1999, and is represented by Formula (0.0.35):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0041] Other compounds which been found to be very potent PDE4 inhibitors are those represented by Formulas (0.0.36), (0.0.37), and (0.0.38):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0042] Compounds have been created which combine PDE4 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitory activity in a single molecule; Groneberg et al., \u201cDual inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 and matrix metalloproteinases by an (arylsulfonyl)hydroxamic acid template,\u201d  J. Med. Chem.  42(4) 541-544, 1999. Two examples of such compounds are represented by Formulas (0.0.39) and (0.0.40):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0043] The respective IC 50  values for the compounds of Formulas (0.1.36) and (0.1.37) using a guinea-pig macrophage PDE4 assay were 1 nM and 30 nM.  \\n       [0044] The compounds identified as KF19514 and KF17625 have been shown in guinea-pig studies to have activity in the inhibition of the following: histamine-induced and antigen-induced bronchoconstriction; PAF-induced lung eosinophilia and antigen-induced BAL eosinophilia; acetylcholine (ACh)-induced AHR; PAF-induced BAL eosinophilia and neutrophilia, and AHRR; antigen-induced bronchospasm; and anaphylactic bronchoconstriction; Fujimura et al., \u201cBronchoprotective effects of KF-19514 and cilostazol in guinea-pigs in vivo,\u201d  Eur.

KF19514 and KF17625 may be represented by Formulas (0.0.41) and (0.0.42):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0045] The reported potency and lack of emesis in a series of indandiones suggests that the hypothesis that has related side-effects such as emesis to the ratio of affinity for the PDE4 enzyme relative to that for the high affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS) is erroneous. Such indandiones may be represented by Formulas (0.0.43) and (0.0.44):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0046] The PDE4 inhibitors that have been created heretofore fall into a significant number of different classes in terms of their chemical structures. Such classes have been as diverse as phenanthridines and naphthyridines. One class of PDE4 inhibitors are lignans such as T-440, which has been demonstrated to have activity in the inhibition of the following: early phase bronchoconstriction induced by antigen, histamine, LTD4, U-46619, Ach, neurokinin A, and endothelin-1; allergen-induced early phase and late phase bronchoconstriction and BAL eosinophilia; and ozone-induced AHR and airway epithelial injury. Optimization of the PDE4 inhibitory potency of such compounds has led to the discovery of T-2585, one of the most potent PDE4 inhibitors described to date with an IC 50  value of 0.13 nM against guinea-pig lung PDE4. T-440 and T-2585 may be represented by Formulas (0.0.45) and (0.0.46):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0047] Another class of PDE4 inhibitors consists of benzofurans and benzothiophenes. In particular, furan and chroman rings have been utilized as surrogates for the cyclopentylether of the rolipram pharmacophore. An example of such a compound is one that is apparently related in structure to BAY 19-8004, and which may be represented by Formula (0.0.47):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0048] Another benzofuran-type compound has been reported to have an IC 50  value of 2.5 nM, and may be represented by Formula (0.0.48):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0049] A compound with a related structure, which is not, however, a benzofuran, is characterized by a fused dioxicin ring and is reported to produce almost complete inhibition of canine tracheal PDE4 at 100 nM. This compound may be represented by Formula (0.0.49):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0050] Quinolines and quinolones are a further class of PDE4 inhibitor structures, and they serve as surrogates for the catechol moiety of rolipram. This compound and two compounds of similar structure may be represented by Formulas (0.0.50), (0.0.51), and (0.0.52):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0051] Purines, xanthines, and pteridines represent yet further classes of chemical compounds to which PDE4 inhibitors described heretofore in the art belong. The compound V-11294A described further above and represented by Formula (0.0.22), is a purine. A PDE4 inhibitor which is a xanthine compound, the class of compounds to which theophylline belongs, has been described in the art; Montana et al., \u201cPDE4 inhibitors, new xanthine analogues,\u201d  Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lefts.  8 2925-2930, 1998. The xanthine compound may be represented by Formula (0.0.54):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0052] A potent PDE4 inhibitor belonging to the pteridine class of compounds has been demonstrated to have an IC 50  value of 16 nM against a PDE4 derived from tumor cells and to inhibit the growth of tumor cells at micromolar concentrations; Merz et al., \u201cSynthesis of 7-Benzylamino-6-chloro-2-piperazino-4-pyrrolidinopteridine and novel derivatives free of positional isomers. Potent inhibitors of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase and of malignant tumor cell growth,\u201d  J. Med. Chem.  41(24) 4733-4743, 1998. The pteridine PDE4 inhibitor may be represented by Formula (0.0.55):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0053] Triazines represent a still further class of chemical compounds to which PDE4 inhibitors belong that have been described in the art heretofore. Two such triazines have been described which display bronchodilator activity and are potent relaxant agents in a guinea-pig trachea model. These compounds, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.56) and (0.0.57) below, are also moderately potent PDE4 inhibitors with IC 50  values of 150 and 140 nM, respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0054] A triazine having a structure assumed to be closely related to that of the compounds of Formulas (0.0.56) and (0.0.57) is UCB-29936, which has been demonstrated to have activity in a murine model of septic shock; Danhaive et al., \u201cUCB29936, a selective phosphodiesterase Type IV inhibitor: therapeutic potential in endotoxic shock,\u201d  Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med.  159A611, 1999.  \\n       [0055] Efforts have also been made in the art to improve the selectivity of PDE4 inhibitors with respect to the A through D subtypes described further above. There are presently four known isoforms (subtypes) of the PDE4 isozyme, encompassing seven splice variants, also described further above. The PDE4D isoform mRNA is expressed in inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils, and it has been suggested in the art that D-selective inhibitors of PDE4 will provide good clinical efficacy with reduced side-effects. A nicotinamide derivative displaying selectivity for inhibition of the PDE4D isoform has been described; WO 98/45268; as well as a naphthyridine derivative reported to be a PDE4D selective inhibitor; WO 98/18796.

The disclosures of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,602,157 and 5,614,540 differ from that of U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,438 and each other as to the definition of the R 3  group, which in the case of the ARIFLO\u00ae compound, is CN. A preferred salt form of the ARIFLO\u00ae compound is disclosed to be the tris(hydroxymethyl)ammonium methane salt.  \\n       [0077] U.S. Pat. No. 5,863,926 (Christensen et al.) discloses analogs of the ARIFLO\u00ae compound, e.g., that of Formula (0.1.11):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0078] WO 99/18793 (Webb et al.) discloses a process of making the ARIFLO\u00ae and related compounds. WO 95/00139 (Barnette et al.) claims a compound which has an IC 50  ratio of about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC 50  for the PDE IV catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity, divided by the IC 50  for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity; but in a dependent claim restricts the scope thereof to a compound which was not known to be a PDE4 inhibitor prior to Jun. 21, 1993.  \\n       [0079] WO 99/20625 (Eggleston) discloses crystalline polymorphic forms of cipamfylline for treatment of PDE 4  and TNF mediated diseases, of Formula (0.1.12):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0080] WO 99/20280 (Griswold et al.) discloses a method of treating pruritis by administering an effective amount of a PDE4 inhibitor, e.g., a compound of Formula (0.1.13):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0081] U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,557 (Pon) discloses a CHO-K1 cell line which stably expresses high levels of a full length low-Km cAMP specific PDE4A enzyme, which has, in turn, been used to examine potent PDE4 enzyme inhibitors and compare the rank order of their potencies in elevating cAMP in a whole-cell preparation with their ability to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity in a broken-cell preparation. It is further said to be found that the soluble enzyme inhibition assay described in the prior art does not reflect behavior of the inhibitors acting in vivo. An improved soluble enzyme whole-cell assay is then disclosed which is said to reflect the behavior of inhibitors acting in vivo. It is further disclosed that there exist at least four distinct PDE4 isoforms or subtypes, and that each subtype has been shown to give rise to a number of splice variants, which in themselves can exhibit different cellular localization and affinities for inhibitors.  \\n       [0082] With regard to the disclosures of the above-identified patents and published patent applications, it will be appreciated that the compounds involved possess the same biological activity as the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). At the same time, however, the artisan will observe that the chemical structures of said compounds disclosed in the prior art are not only diverse from each other but dissimilar to that of the novel compounds of the present invention as well. The state of the art contains still further information regarding compounds which are dissimilar in chemical structure to those of Formula (1.0.0), and which, moreover, do not possess PDE4 inhibitory activity similar to that of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). Such compounds disclosed in the prior art do, nevertheless, often have therapeutic utility similar to that possessed by the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), i.e., in the treatment of inflammatory, respiratory and allergic diseases and conditions. In particular this is applicable to certain inhibitors of enzymes and antagonists of receptors in the so-called leukotriene pathway. This is especially the case with regard to the leukotrienes LTB 4  and LTD 4 . Accordingly, representative patents and published patent applications disclosing further information of this type are described below.  \\n       [0083] Arachidonic acid is metabolized by cyclooxygenase-1 and by 5-lipoxygenase. The 5-lipoxygenase pathway leads to the production of leukotrienes (LTs) which contribute to the inflammatory response through their effect on neutrophil aggregation, degranulation and chemotaxis; vascular permeability; smooth muscle contractility; and on lymphocytes The cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and LTE 4 , play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. The components of the leukotriene pathway which afford targets for therapeutic intervention are illustrated in the following diagram:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0084] Accordingly, agents which are able to intervene in any of the steps of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway afford an opportunity for therapeutic treatment. An example of one such agent is the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, zileuton, a therapeutic agent identified as ZYFLO\u00ae which may be represented by Formula (0.1.14):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0085] Another such agent is the LTD 4  receptor antagonist zafirlukast, a therapeutic agent identified as ACCOLATE\u00ae which may be represented by Formula (0.1.15):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0086] A further such LTD 4  receptor antagonist is montelukast, a therapeutic agent identified as SINGULAIR\u00ae which may be represented by Formula (0.1.16):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0087] Another type of the above-mentioned therapeutic targets is the LTB 4  receptor, and an example of an antagonist for said receptor is BIIL-260, a therapeutic agent which may be represented by Formula (0.1.17):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0088] Another example of a therapeutic agent which is an LTB 4  receptor antagonist is CGS-25019c which may be represented by Formula (0.1.18):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0089] Nothing in the above-described state of the art discloses or would suggest to the artisan the novel compounds of the present invention or their PDE4 inhibitory activity and the resulting significant improvement in therapeutic utility and therapeutic index in the treatment of inflammatory, respiratory and allergic diseases and conditions.  \\n       4.0 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0090] The present invention is concerned with novel compounds which have biological activity as inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase so-called \u201cType IV\u201d isoenzyme (\u201cPDE4 isozyme\u201d). Embodiments of the novel compounds of the present invention are active as non-selective inhibitors of the PDE4 isozyme. Other embodiments of said novel compounds have PDE4 isozyme substrate specificity, especially for the D subtype. Said novel compounds having non-selective or D-selective PDE4 inhibitor activity are generally useful in the therapeutic treatment of various inflammatory, allergic, and respiratory diseases and conditions, and they afford in particular a significant improvement in the therapeutic treatment of obstructive respiratory diseases, especially asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  \\n       [0091] The present invention relates to a compound of Formula (1.0.0):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0092] wherein  \\n       [0093] g is 0 or 1;

A further description of said compounds is provided hereafter in terms of a range of different types and groups of embodiments, as well as specific embodiments which characterize and exemplify the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). Preferred and more preferred embodiments of said compounds are also set forth, but it will be understood that the recital of such preferences is in no way intended to, and does not limit the scope of the present invention with regard to said compounds.  \\n       [0231] The meaning of the terminal moiety E set forth in detail above is that of a member independently selected from the group consisting of partial Formulas (1.1.1 ) through (1.1.15):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0232] The substituents R 7   A , R 7   B , and R 7   C , as well as R 9 , R 16 , and R 17  of the above enumerated partial Formulas, as well as their sub-substituents R 10 , R 11 , R 12 , R 14 , R 15 , R 18 , and R 19 , are defined above and provide a clear delineation of the intended scope of the compounds of the present invention. Particular embodiments within said scope comprise particular meanings of the substituents R 7   A , R 7   B , R 7   C , and R 9 , as well as of the other substituents that form a part of Formula (1.0.0). Said embodiments include, but are not limited to those set forth in paragraphs (i) through (vi) further below.  \\n       [0233] In order to assist the person of ordinary skill in considering the scope and extent of the description of the present invention set forth hereafter, certain terms and expressions used herein are defined in the paragraphs immediately below.  \\n       [0234] As used herein, the expressions \u201c\u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl\u201d, \u201c\u2014(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl\u201d, and \u201c\u2014(C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl\u201d, are intended to include branched as well as straight chain conformations of these aliphatic groups. Thus, the above-quoted expressions include, in addition to the straight chain entities methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, and n-hexyl, the branched chain entities iso-propyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, teff-butyl, iso-pentane (2-methylbutane), 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, 1-ethylpropane, and 1-ethylbutane. The meanings of the above-quoted expressions are also intended to apply to said expressions whether or not they are substituted. Thus, the expression \u201cfluorinated \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl\u201d is intended to encompass the various fluorinated species of the n-propyl and iso-propyl aliphatic groups.  \\n       [0235] As used herein with respect to compounds of Formula (1.0.0), as well as other formulas and partial formulas relating thereto, where one or more nitrogen atom components thereof is or are represented as [N (O)], it or they comprise(s) an optional nitrogen oxide form of said nitrogen atom(s). Where there is more than one such nitrogen oxide form, they are selected independently of each other. Further, it will be appreciated that said nitrogen oxide form(s) may also be represented as \u201c[N (O) u ]\u201d where u is 0 or 1.  \\n       [0236] Both G 1  and G 2  are defined herein as comprising a saturated or unsaturated carbon ring system that is a 3- to 7-membered monocyclic, or that is a 7- to 12-membered, fused polycyclic; wherein optionally one carbon atom of said carbon ring system may be replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, O, and S; where optionally a second carbon atom thereof, and further optionally a third carbon atom thereof may be replaced by N. These definintions are intended to mean first, a carbon ring system having two or more rings, especially bicyclic and tricyclic, more especially bicyclic, in which the rings are fused, i.e., there is at least one pair of bridgehead carbon atoms present. These polycyclic ring systems may be saturated or unsaturated. Second, the above-quoted definition is also intended to mean a carbon ring system having two or more rings in which said rings are discontinuous, i.e., they are attached to each other by a single or double covalent bond and there are no bridgehead carbon atoms present. These polycyclic ring systems may also be saturated or unsaturated.  \\n       [0237] Respecting the situation where a carbon ring system has been selected that is discontinuous, as opposed to one that is fused, it should be noted that the moiety G 1  is not permitted to be such a discontinuous carbon ring system. The moiety G 2  on the other hand, is required to be discontinuous in this situation. It is further provided herein that the moiety G 2  may have the meaning of a carbon ring system that is discontinuous, or it may have the meaning of a \u201crestricted biaryl\u201d carbon ring system. These two aspects have been brought together under the expression \u201cdiscontinuous or restricted biaryl\u201d, which as used herein is intended to mean a discontinuous ring system or a fused polycyclic ring system as defined immediately above in which (1) bridgehead carbon atoms are joined by a bond, i.e., there are no additional carbon atoms present between said bridgehead carbon atoms; and (2) heteroatoms, if present, are contained only in a tricyclic or higher polycyclic fused ring system.  \\n       [0238] Further, however, it should be noted that the moiety G 2  may have the meaning of a carbon ring system as defined above that is neither discontinuous nor a restricted biaryl. Thus, G 2  may be a saturated or unsaturated mono- or polycyclic optionally containing heteroatoms as described above. Accordingly, the moiety G 2  has the meaning, e.g., of phenyl, cyclohexyl, or pyridyl. The moiety G 1  also has this meaning.  \\n       [0239] The types of restricted biaryl and discontinuous ring systems that may comprise a meaning of G 2 , but that may not comprise a meaning of G 1  include, inter alia, the following, where the numbers after the names refer to the partial Formulas therefor recited elsewhere herein: biphenyl (1.2.1); 3-phenyl-pyridine (1.2.2); cyclohexyl-benzene (1.2.3); [2,2\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.4); bicyclohexyl (1.2.5); 2-phenyl-thiophene (1.2.6); 2-phenyl-furan (1.2.7); naphthalene (1.2.8); diphenylmethane (1.2.9); 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (1.2.10); 3-benzyl-pyridine (1.2.11); 4,5-diphenyl-oxazole (1.2.12); fluorene (1.2.13); 9H-carbazole (1.2.14); phenyl ether (1.2.15); 1H-indole (1.2.16); quinoline (1.2.17); phenanthrene (1.2.18); phenanthridine (1.2.19); [3,3\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.20); [4,4\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.21); 2-cyclohexyl-pyridine (1.2.22); biphenylene (1.2.23); 3-benzhydryl-pyridine (1.2.24); 2-phenyl-thiazole (1.2.25); 2-phenyl-oxazole (1.2.26); 5-phenyl-pyrimidine (1.2.27); 1 OH-phenothiazine (1.2.28); 2-phenyl-benzooxazole (1.2.29); 2-phenyl-benzothiazole (1.2.30); 2-phenyl-1 H-benzoimidazole (1.2.31); and 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1.2.32).  \\n       [0240] As a further illustration, it will be understood that, e.g., a naphthyl moiety is a restricted biaryl moiety as defined herein, since it is a fused bicyclic with a bond between the bridgehead carbon atoms, and there are no heteroatoms present. A quinolinyl moiety, on the other hand, while also a fused bicyclic with a bond between the bridgehead carbon atoms, is not a restricted biaryl moiety as defined herein, since a nitrogen heteroatom is also present, and the definition of restricted biaryl as used herein requires that the fused ring system be tricyclic or higher polycyclic where a heteroatom is present. The biphenyl moiety is an example of a discontinuous ring system that, accordingly, may be a meaning of G 2  but may not be a meaning of G 1 .  \\n       [0241] As used herein, the expression \u201csaturated or unsaturated carbon ring system that is 7- to 12-membered, fused or discontinuous, polycyclic\u201d is intended to include such saturated fused bi- and tricyclic carbon ring systems as norbornane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octanyl, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl, bicyclo[3.3.0]octanyl, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanyl, cyclodecanyl, and adamantanyl. The above-quoted expression is also intended to include such mono-unsaturated bi- and tricyclic carbon ring systems as norbornenyl, bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-enyl, and bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-enyl; as well as such aromatic bi- and tricyclic carbon ring systems as naphthylene and biphenylene. The above-quoted expression is further intended to include such aromatic disontinuous bicyclic carbon ring systems as biphenylene.  \\n       [0242] The carbon ring systems included within the scope of the above-quoted expression and described above also include moieties wherein optionally one carbon atom thereof may be replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, O, or S, and where N is selected, optionally a second carbon atom thereof may be replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, O, and S. The resulting moieties include pyrrolyl; pyrrolidinyl; furanyl; thienyl; pyridyl; pyrimidinyl; piperidinyl; piperazinyl; imidazolyl; imidazolidinyl; oxazolyl; isoxazolyl; thiazolyl; indolyl; quinolinyl; isoquinolinyl; benzimidazolyl; benzoxazolyl; morpholinyl; quinuclidinyl; and azabicyclo[3.3.0]octanyl.

pyrrolyl; pyrrolidinyl; furanyl; thienyl; pyridyl; pyrimidinyl; piperidinyl; piperazinyl; imidazolyl; imidazolidinyl; oxazolyl; isoxazolyl; thiazolyl; indolyl; quinolinyl; isoquinolinyl; benzimidazolyl;

This preferred right-hand-side of the compound of Formula (1.0.0) may be represented by Formula (1.0.4):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0293] Where R 1  and/or R 2  is \u2014H, there will be no substituent at any position attached to the remainder of the left-hand side of the molecule of Formula (1.0.0). Such embodiments are not as preferred as those compounds of the present invention which have a substituent, especially a substituent at the 2-position of either one or both of the phenyl groups that comprise the biphenyl moiety. Thus, in some preferred embodiments of the compounds of the present invention, the meaning of R 1  and R 2  is defined as \u2014H; \u2014Cl; \u2014F; chlorinated- and/or fluorinated \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl; chlorinated- and/or fluorinated \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkoxy; or (C 2 -C 4 ) alkynyl.  \\n       [0294] It is preferred to have a halogen group at the point of the molecule occupied by the R 1  or R 2  substituent, since it usually results in improved inhibitory activity. It is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention that R 1  or R 2  is a small lipophilic group comprising \u2014Cl or \u2014F; chlorinated- and/or fluorinated \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl; or chlorinated- and/or fluorinated \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkoxy.  \\n       [0295] Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention in which the moiety G 2  is biphenyl substituted by R 1  and optionally R 2  include those represented by partial Formulas (2.6.1) through (2.6.12):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0296] 5.3.2 G 2  in Specific Embodiments  \\n       [0297] Embodiments of the present invention may be further illustrated with regard to the moiety G 2  and the substituents R 1  and R 2 , where G 2  has the preferred meanings of phenyl, cyclohexyl, and pyridyl, as well as other meanings such as biphenyl, by the right-hand terminus of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) represented by the following partial Formulas (3.0.1) through (3.0.74):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0298] 5.4.0 The R A  and R B  Substituents  \\n       [0299] The group of partial Formula (1.0.4) above is substituted in the 4-position by a moiety containing the substituents E, R A , and R B , which may be represented by partial Formula (1.1.15):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0300] where m is 0, 1, 2, or 3. In the more preferred embodiments of the compounds of the present invention, m has the meaning of 0 or 1. When m is 1 the moiety \u2014[R A \u2014C\u2014R B ] m \u2014 is present, and R A  and R B  are preferably each a member independently selected from the group consisting of \u2014H; and (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl.  \\n       [0301] In other preferred embodiments of the present invention R A  and R B  may be taken together, but only in the case where m is 1, to form a spiro moiety of Formula (1.2.0):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0302] where r and s are independently 0 to 4 provided that the sum of r+s is at least 1, but not greater than 5; X A  is \u2014CH 2 , \u2014CHR 11 , or \u2014C(R 11 ) 2 \u2014 where each R 11  is selected independently of the other and each R 12  has the same meaning as defined herein; \u2014NR 15 \u2014 where R 15  has the same meaning as defined herein; \u2014O\u2014; or \u2014S(\u2550O) t , where t is 0, 1, or 2; and said spiro moiety is substituted as to any one or more carbon atoms thereof by 0 to 3 substituents R 14 , as to a nitrogen atom thereof by 0 or 1 substituent R 15 , and as to a sulfur atom thereof by 0 or 2 oxygen atoms. Accordingly, there results, inter alia, the moieties illustrated by partial Formulas (1.5.1) through (1.5.12):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0303] where t is 0, 1, or 2; and R 14  and R 15  have the same meaning as defined herein.  \\n       [0304] Preferred meanings of the R 14  substituent include \u2014F; \u2014Cl; =O; \u2014OH; \u2014CH 3 ; \u2014CH 2 OH; \u2014CH(CH 3 )OH; \u2014C(CH 3 ) 2 OH; \u2014OCH 3 ; \u2014C(\u2550O)OH; \u2014C(\u2550O)NH 2 ; \u2014NH 2 ; \u2014NHCH(CH 3 ) 2 ; \u2014NHC(\u2550O)CH 3 ; \u2014NHC(\u2550O)OCH 2 CH 3 ; \u2014NHS(\u2550O) 2 CH 3 ; and \u2014S(\u2550O) 2 NH 2 , resulting in moieties such as those of partial Formulas (3.1.1) through (3.1.34):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0305] 5.4.1 The R C  and R D  Substituents  \\n       [0306] As already described, R C  and R D  have the same meaning as defined above for R A  and R B , except that one of them must be \u2014H, and they are selected independently of each other and of R A  and R B . Accordingly, all of the particular and preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) detailed above with regard to the R A  and R B  substituents, are for the most part also particular and preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) with regard to the R C  and R D  substituents. \u20145.5 The Moiety \u2014[N(R 3 )] j \u2014 \\n       [0307] The subscript j has the meaning of 0 or 1. Where j has the meaning of 1, which is the preferred meaning, the moiety \u2014N(R 3 )\u2014 is present and the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are essentially thiazolyl- and analogous amides in structure. The nitrogen atom substituent R 3  is preferably selected from \u2014H; \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl; and \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkoxy; and is more preferably \u2014H; \u2014CH 3 ; or \u2014OCH 3 . In the most preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), R 3  has the meaning of \u2014H.  \\n       [0308] Where G 1  has the preferred meaning of phenyl; G 2  has the preferred meaning of phenyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, pyridyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, biphenyl, 3-phenyl-pyridine, cyclohexyl-benzene, [2,2\u2032]bipyridinyl, or bicyclohexyl, especially phenyl, cyclohexyl, or biphenyl; and j has the meaning of 0, which is a less preferred meaning than where j is 1; the moiety \u2014N(R 3 )\u2014 is absent and the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are essentially nicotinoyl moieties, i.e., ketones in structure. This ketone structure of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is represented by Formula (1.0.7):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0309] where all of the substituents and components thereof, i.e., E; W 1 ; W 2 ; Y; g, k, m, and n; R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , and R 6 ; and R A , R B , R C , and R D ; have, for the most part, the same particular and preferred meanings described in detail herein, as where j is 1 and the compounds are thiazolyl- and analogous amides in structure.  \\n       [0310] 5.6.0 E Is a Moiety of Partial Formulas (1.1.1)-(1.1.15)  \\n       [0311] E is a member selected from the group of moieties defined by partial Formulas (1.1.1) through (1.1.15) illustrated further above. The moieties of partial Formulas (1.1.1) through (1.1.5) which define the E group are typically but not necessarily acids, amides, and heterocyclyl groups that act as acid and amide mimetics, but they are not limited to these types of functional groups. The moieties of partial Formulas (1.1.6) through (1.1.9) which define the E group are typically but not necessarily tertiary alcohols and their mimetics, especially analogous acyl and nitrile moieties, but they are not limited to these types of functional groups. The moieties of partial Formulas (1.1.10) through (1.1.15) which define the E group are typically but not necessarily inverse amides and their mimetics, but they are not limited to these types of functional groups. Other moieties as described herein may be employed at the right-hand-side of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). These moieties are bioisostereic in that they permit the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) containing them to achieve PDE4 inhibition essentially equivalent to that achieved by other moieties, especially acid, amide, alcohol, and inverse amide moieties.  \\n       [0312] Accordingly, E is a member selected from the group of moieties defined by partial Formulas (1.1.1) through (1.1.15), and said moieties include substituents R 7   A , R 7   B , and R 7   C , as well as R 7   B , R 9 , R 16 , and R 17 , and in the case of partial Formula (1.1.15) the moiety consists of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring system. All of the moieties of partial Formulas (1.1.1) through (1.1.15) are attached to the remaining portion of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0313] 5.6.1 E Is a Moiety of Partial Formulas (1.1.1), (1.1.2), or (1.1.3)  \\n       [0314] Embodiments of the present invention wherein the definition of the E group is illustrated by partial Formulas (1.1.1); (1.1.2); and (1.1.3), are as follows:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0315] One of a number of preferred moieties for defining the E group is that of partial Formula (1.1.1) where R 7   A  has the meaning of \u2014H, which is a preferred meaning of this substituent. Where R 7   A  is hydrogen and m is 1, 2, or 3 in Formula (1.0.0), a simple carboxylic acid \u2014COOH results, and the group becomes a lower alkanoic acid.  \\n       [0316] R 10  is an optional substituent of the moieties that define R 7   A , and there may be up to three such substituents when present. The meaning of the R 10  substituent includes phenyl or pyridyl where said phenyl or pyridyl is in turn optionally substituted by up to 3 substituents R 11  where R 11  is \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014CN, \u2014NO 2 , \u2014OH, \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkoxy, \u2014(C 1 -C 3 ) alkyl, or \u2014NR 16 R 17 . In preferred embodiments that include such R 11  substitution, there will be 1 or 2 substituents R 11  that have the meaning of \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014CH 3 , \u2014OCH 3 , \u2014OH, \u2014CN, or \u2014N(CH 3 ) 2 . Preferably, there is 0 or 1 such R 11  substituent and when present it is \u2014F or \u2014Cl. The meaning of the R 10  substituent further includes \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014CF 3 , oxo (\u2550O), \u2014OR 16 , \u2014NO 2 , \u2014CN, \u2014C(\u2550O)OR 16 , \u2014O\u2014C(\u2550O)R 16 , \u2014C(\u2550O)NR 16 R 17 , \u2014O\u2014C(\u2550O)NR 16 R 17 , \u2014NR 16 R 17 , \u2014NR 16 C(\u2550O)R 17 , \u2014NR 16 C(\u2550O)OR 17 , \u2014NR 16 S(\u2550O) 2 R 17 , or \u2014S(\u2550O) 2 NR 16 R 17 .  \\n       [0317] The sub-substituents R 16  and R 17  comprise \u2014H; \u2014(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl, preferably \u2014CH 3 ; \u2014(C 2 -C 4 ) alkenyl; \u2014(C 3 -C 6 ) cycloalkyl, preferably cyclopropyl; phenyl; benzyl; or pyridyl. Said alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl, benzyl, or pyridyl groups are in turn optionally substituted by up to 3 substituents \u2014F, \u2014Cl, or \u2014CN. Among the above-recited additional meanings of R 10 , it is preferred that the R 1  substituent when present be pyridyl optionally substituted by \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014OCH 3 , \u2014CN, \u2014NO 2 , or \u2014NR 16 R 17  where R 16  and R 17  are independently \u2014H or \u2014CH 3 ; or that the R 10  substituent when present be \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014CF 3 , \u2014CN, \u2014NO 2 , \u2014C(\u2550O)OR 16 , or \u2014NR 16 R 17  where R 16  and R 17  are independently \u2014H or \u2014CH 3 .  \\n       [0318] These and other preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) comprising the moieties of partial Formula (1.1.1) based on the preferred meanings of R 7   A  and R 9  as described above, include, inter alia, the following groups illustrated by partial Formulas (3.5.1) through (3.5.15):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0319] The E group is represented by partial Formula (1.1.2) in which the nitrogen atom is substituted by R 9  where R 9  has the meaning of \u2014H; \u2014(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl; \u2014(C 3 -C 7 ) cycloalkyl; phenyl; benzyl; \u2014C(\u2550O)OR 16 ; \u2014C(\u2550O)R 16 ; \u2014OR 16 ; \u2014(C 1 -C 2 ) alkyl-OR 16 ; or \u2014(C 1 -C 2 ) alkyl-C(\u2550O)OR 16 ; where R 16  is \u2014H or \u2014(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl. R 16  is preferably \u2014H or \u2014CH 3 .  \\n       [0320] Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention where the E group is represented by partial Formula (1.1.2) may be illustrated as follows by partial Formulas (4.1.1) through (4.1.5):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0321] Those embodiments wherein the definition of E is that of an amide group, are illustrated by partial Formula (1.1.3):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0322] These and other preferred embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) comprising moieties of partial Formula (1.1.3), based on the meanings of R 7   A  and R 9  described above, include, inter alia, the following groups illustrated by partial Formulas (4.5.1) through (4.5.20):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0323] 5.6.2 E Is a Moiety of Partial Formula (1.1.4)  \\n       [0324] Preferred embodiments of the present invention also comprise those compounds of Formula (1.0.0) wherein terminal moiety E falls within the scope of partial Formula (1.1.4), i.e., embodiments of this type are encompassed within the scope of the E moiety when it has the meaning of partial Formula (1.1.4): (1.1.4)  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0325] wherein R 7   B  is a monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclyl which is a member selected from the group consisting of tetrazol-5-yl; 1,2,4-triazol-3-yl; 1,2,4-triazol-3-on-5-yl; 1,2,3-triazol-5-yl; imidazol-2-yl; imidazol-4-yl; imidazolidin-2-on-4-yl; 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl; 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-on-3-yl; 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl; 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-on-5-yl; 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl; 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-on-5-yl; oxazolyl; isoxazolyl; pyrrolyl; pyrazolyl; succinimidyl; glutarimidyl; pyrrolidonyl; 2-piperidonyl; 2-pyridonyl; 4-pyridonyl; pyridazin-3-onyl; pyridazin-3-onyl, thiazolyl; isothiazolyl; thiadiazolyl; morpholinyl; parathiazinyl; pyridyl; pyrimidinyl; pyrazinyl; pyridazinyl; indolyl; indolinyl; isoindolinyl; benzo[b]furanyl; 2,3-dihydrobenzofuranyl; 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuranyl; 2H-1-benzopyranyl; 2-H-chromenyl; chromanyl; benzothienyl; 1H-indazolyl; benzimidazolyl; benzoxazolyl; benzisoxazolyl; benzothiazolyl; benzotriazolyl; benzotriazinyl; phthalazinyl; 1,8-naphthyridinyl; quinolinyl; isoquinolinyl; quinazolinyl; quinoxalinyl; pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinyl; pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidinyl; imidazo[1,2-a]pyridinyl; pyridopyridinyl; pteridinyl; and 1H-purinyl.  \\n       [0326] Partial Formulas (1.1.3) and (1.1.4) are similar and the distinction between them should be noted. Partial Formulas (1.1.3) and (1.1.4) are as follows:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0327] Where v is 0, R 7   B  is linked in a direct fashion to the remaining portion of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) and it is, accordingly, readily distinguishable from a moiety of partial Formula (1.1.3) in which R 7   A  is linked to the remaining portion of a compound of Formula .

Any one or more of the carbon atoms of said heterocyclic group is substituted by 0 to 3 substituents R 14 .

As a further demonstration of the scope and content of the present invention, specific compounds comprising embodiments of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are presented. Such species of Formula (1.0.0) include, but are not limited to the following compounds of Formulas (8.5.1) through (8.5.44):  \\n                 \\n \\n       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0392] 6.0 Processes for Making the Compounds of Formula (1.0.0)  \\n       [0393] A method suitable for preparing the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) where both the G 1  and G 2  groups are phenyl, and the E group is a moiety of partial Formula (1.1.8), is illustrated in Synthesis Scheme (10.0.0) below.  \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n                 \\n \\n       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0394] 7.0 Pharmaceutical Salts and Other Forms  \\n       [0395] The above-described compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of acids, esters, or other chemical classes of compounds to which the compounds described belong. It is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize those compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases in accordance with procedures well known in the art.  \\n       [0396] Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are prepared for the most part by conventional means. Where the compound of Formula (1.0.0) contains a carboxylic acid group, a suitable salt thereof may be formed by reacting the compound with an appropriate base to provide the corresponding base addition salt. Examples of such bases are alkali metal hydroxides including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, e.g., potassium ethanolate and sodium propanolate; and various organic bases such as piperidine, diethanolamine, and N-methylglutamine. Also included are the aluminum salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0397] For certain compounds of Formula (1.0.0) acid addition salts may be formed by treating said compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids, e.g., hydrohalides such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide; other mineral acids and their corresponding salts such as sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, etc.; and alkyl- and mono-arylsulfonates such as ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, and benzenesulfonate; and other organic acids and their corresponding salts such as acetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascorbate, etc.  \\n       [0398] Accordingly, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) include, but are not limited to: acetate, adipate, alginate, arginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, caprylate, chloride, chlorobenzoate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, galacterate (from mucic acid), galacturonate, glucoheptanoate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, hemisuccinate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-Hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isethionate, iso-butyrate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogenphosphate, 2-Naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, oleate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, phenylacetate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, phosphonate, phthalate.  \\n       [0399] Further, base salts of the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts. Preferred among the above-recited salts are ammonium; the alkali metal salts sodium and potassium; and the alkaline earth metal salts calcium and magnesium. Salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include, but are not limited to salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, e.g., arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine, choline, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, iso-propylamine, lidocaine, lysine, meglumine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, and tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methylamine (tromethamine).  \\n       [0400] Compounds of the present invention which comprise basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl halides, e.g., methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; di(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl sulfate, e.g., dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl sulfates; (C 10 -C 18 ) alkyl halides, e.g., decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aryl-(C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl halides, e.g., benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Such salts permit the preparation of both water-soluble and oil-soluble compounds of the present invention.  \\n       [0401] Among the above-recited pharmaceutical salts those which are preferred include, but are not limited to acetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisuccinate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, meglumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stearate, sulfate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate, and tromethamine.  \\n       [0402] The acid addition salts of basic compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the present invention.  \\n       [0403] As indicated, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, or organic amines. Preferred metals are sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Preferred organic amines are N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and procaine.  \\n       [0404] The base addition salts of acidic compounds of the present invention are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid form in the conventional manner. The free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free acid forms for purposes of the present invention.  \\n       [0405] Multiple salts forms are included within the scope of the present invention where a compound of the present invention contains more than one group capable of forming such pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of typical multiple salt forms include, but are not limited to bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, diphosphate, disodium, and trihydrochloride.  \\n       [0406] In light of the above, it can be seen that the expression \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein is intended to mean an active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0) utilized in the form of a salt thereof, especially where said salt form confers on said active ingredient improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to the free form of said active ingredient or some other salt form of said active ingredient utilized previously. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of said active ingredient may also initially confer a desirable pharmacokinetic property on said active ingredient which it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of said active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body.  \\n       [0407] The pharmacokinetic properties of said active ingredient which may be favorably affected include, e.g., the manner in which said active ingredient is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of said active ingredient. While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important, and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of said active ingredient is usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof which it utilized. Further, as the artisan will appreciate, an aqueous solution of said active ingredient will provide the most rapid absorption of said active ingredient into the body of a patient being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid dosage forms, will result in less rapid absorption of said active ingredient.  \\n       [0408] Oral ingestion of an active ingredient of Formula (1.0.0) is the most preferred route of administration for reasons of safety, convenience, and economy, but absorption of such an oral dosage form can be adversely affected by physical characteristics such as polarity, emesis caused by irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, destruction by digestive enzymes and low pH, irregular absorption or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and metabolism by enzymes of the mucosa, the intestinal flora, or the liver. Formulation of said active ingredient into different pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms may be effective in overcoming or alleviating one or more of the above-recited problems encountered with absorption of oral dosage forms.  \\n       [0409] A compound of Formula (1.0.0) prepared in accordance with the methods described herein can be separated from the reaction mixture in which it is finally produced by any ordinary means known to the chemist skilled in the preparation of organic compounds. Once separated said compound can be purified by known methods. Various methods and techniques can be used as the means for separation and purification, and include, e.g., distillation; recrystallization; column chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; gel chromatography; affinity chromatography; preparative thin-layer chromatography; and solvent extraction.  \\n       [0410] 7.1 Stereoisomers  \\n       [0411] A compound within the scope of Formula (1.0.0) may be such that its constituent atoms are capable of being arranged in space in two or more different ways, despite having identical connectivities. As a consequence, said compound exists in the form of stereoisomers. Sys-trans isomerism is but one type of stereoisomerism. Where the stereoisomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other, they are enantiomers which have chirality or handedness, because of the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in their constituent structure. Enantiomers are optically active and therefore distinguishable because they rotate the plane of polarized light by equal amounts, but in opposite directions.  \\n       [0412] Where two or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in a compound of Formula (1.0.0), there are two possible configurations at each said carbon atom. Where two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, for example, there are four possible stereoisomers. Further, these four possible stereoisomers may be arranged into six possible pairs of stereoisomers that are different from each other. In order for a pair of molecules with more than one asymmetric carbon to be enantiomers, they must have different configurations at every asymmetric carbon. Those pairs that are not related as enantiomers have a different stereochemical relationship referred to as a diastereomeric relationship. Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are called diastereoisomers, or more commonly, diastereomers.  \\n       [0413] All of these well known aspects of the stereochemistry of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are contemplated to be a part of the present invention. Within the scope of the present invention there is thus included compounds of Formula (1.0.0) that are stereoisomers, and where these are enantiomers, the individual enantiomers, racemic mixtures of said enantiomers, and artificial, i.e., manufactured mixtures containing proportions of said enantiomers that are different from the proportions of said enantiomers found in a racemic mixture. Where a compound of Formula (1.0.0) comprises stereoisomers that are diastereomers, there is included within the scope of said compound the individual diastereomers as well as mixtures of any two or more of said diastereomers in any proportions thereof.  \\n       [0414] By way of illustration, in the case where there is a single asymmetric carbon atom in a compound of Formula (1.0.0), resulting in the (\u2212)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers thereof; there is included within the scope of said compound all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms, prodrugs and metabolites thereof which are therapeutically active and useful in treating or preventing the diseases and conditions described further herein. Where a compound of Formula (1.0.0) exists in the form of (\u2212)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers, there is also included within the scope of said compound the (+)(S) enantiomer alone, or the (\u2212)(R) enantiomer alone, in the case where all, substantially all, or a predominant share of the therapeutic activity resides in only one of said enantiomers, and/or unwanted side effects reside in only one of said enantiomers. In the case where there is substantially no difference between the biological activities of both enantiomers, there is further included within the scope of said compound of Formula (1.0.0) the (+)(S) enantiomer and the (\u2212)(R) enantiomer present together as a racemic mixture or as a non-racemic mixture in any ratio of proportionate amoun&#39;ts thereof.  \\n       [0415] For example, the particular biological activities and/or physical and chemical properties of a pair or set of enantiomers of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) where such exist, may suggest use of said enantiomers in certain ratios to constitute a final therapeutic product. By way of illustration, in the case where there is a pair of enantiomers, they may be employed in ratios such as 90% (R)-10% (S); 80% (R)-20% (S); 70% (R)-30% (S); 60% (R)-40% (S); 50% (R)-50% (S); 40% (R)-60% (S); 30% (R)-70% (S); 20% (R)-80% (S); and 10% (R)-90% (S). After evaluating the properties of the various enantiomers of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) where such exist, the proportionate amount of one or more of said enantiomers with certain desired properties that will constitute the final therapeutic product can be determined in a straightforward manner.  \\n       [0416] 7.2 Isotopes  \\n       [0417] There is further contemplated to be included within the scope of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) isotopically-labelled forms thereof. An isotopically-labelled form of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) is identical to said compound but for the fact that one or more atoms of said compound have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g.,  2 H,  3 H,  13 C,  14 C,  15 N,  18 O,  17 O,  31 P,  32 P,  35 S,  18 F, and  36 Cl, respectively. A compound of Formula (1.0.0), a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.  \\n       [0418] An isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0) may be used in a number of beneficial ways. For example, an isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0), e.g., one in which a radioactive isotope such as  3 H or  14 C has been incorporated, will be useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. These radioactive isotopes, i.e., tritium,  3 H, and carbon-14,  14 C, are especially preferred for their ease of preparation and eminent detectability. Incorporation of heavier isotopes, e.g., deuterium,  2 H, into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) will provide therapeutic advantages based on the greater metabolic stability of said isotopically-labelled compound. Greater metabolic stability translates directly into increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, which under most circumstances would constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0) can usually be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Synthesis Schemes and related description, Examples, and Preparations herein, substituting a readily available isotopically-labelled reagent for its corresponding non-isotopically-labelled reagent.  \\n       [0419] Deuterium,  2 H, can also be incorporated into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) for the purpose of manipulating the oxidative metabolism of said compound by way of the primary kinetic isotope effect. The primary kinetic isotope effect is a change of rate for a chemical reaction that results from substitution of isotopic nuclei, which in turn is caused by the change in ground state energies required for covalent bond formation subsequent to said isotopic substitution. Substitution of a heavier isotope will usually result in a lowering of the ground state energy for a chemical bond, thereby causing a reduction in rate for a rate-limiting bond breaking step. If the bond-breaking event occurs on or near a saddle-point region along the coordinate of a multi-product reaction, the product distribution ratios can be altered substantially. By way of illustration, when deuterium is bound to a carbon atom at a non-exchangeable site, rate differences of k M /k D =2-7 are typical. This difference in rate, applied successfully to an oxidatively labile compound of Formula (1.0.0), can dramatically affect the profile of said compound in vivo and result in improved pharmacokinetic properties.  \\n       [0420] In discovering and developing therapeutic agents, the skilled artisan seeks to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters while retaining desirable in vitro properties. It is a reasonable surmise that many compounds with poor pharmacokinetic profiles suffer from a lability to oxidative metabolism. In vitro liver microsomal assays now available provide valuable information about the course of this oxidative metabolism, which in turn permits the rational design of deuterated compounds of Formula (1.0.0) with improved stability through resistance to such oxidative metabolism. Significant improvements in the pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are thereby obtained, and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of increases in in vivo half-life (t/2), concentration at maximum therapeutic effect (C max ), area under the dose response curve (AUC), and F; and in terms of decreases in clearance, dose, and cost-of-goods.  \\n       [0421] By way of illustration of the above, a compound of Formula (1.0.0) which has multiple potential sites for oxidative metabolism, e.g., benzylic hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms a to a nitrogen atom, is prepared as a series of analogs in which various combinations of hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms so that some, most or all of said hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium atoms. Half-life determinations provide an expedient and accurate determination of the extent of improvement in resistance to oxidative metabolism. In this manner it is determined that the half-life of the parent compound can be extended by as much as 100% as the result of such deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution.  \\n       [0422] Deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution in a compound of Formula (1.0.0) can also be used to achieve a favorable alteration in the metabolite profile of the parent compound as a way of diminishing or eliminating unwanted toxic metabolites. For example, where a toxic metabolite arises through an oxidative carbon-hydrogen, C\u2014H, bond scission, the deuterated analog is reasonably expected to greatly diminish or eliminate production of the unwanted metabolite, even in the case where the particular oxidation is not a rate-determining step.  \\n       [0423] Further information concerning the state of the art with respect to deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution may be found, e.g., in Hanzlik et al.,  J. Org. Chem.  55 3992-3997, 1990; Reider et al.,  J. Org. Chem.  52 3326-3334, 1987; Foster,  Adv. Drug Res.  14 1-40, 1985; Gillette et al. ,  Biochemistry  33(10) 2927-2937, 1994; and Jarman et al.  Carcinogenesis  16(4) 683-688, 1993.  \\n       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0424] 8.0 Therapeutic Applications and Clinical Endpoints  \\n       [0425] The description which follows concerns the therapeutic applications to which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) may be put, and where applicable an explanation of the clinical endpoints associated with such therapeutic applications. There is also set forth a disclosure of various in vitro assays and animal model experiments, which are capable of providing data sufficient to define and demonstrate the therapeutic utility of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0426] The therapeutic utility of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is applicable to a patient or subject afflicted with a disease or condition as herein set forth and therefore in need of such treatment. The beneficial results are therapeutic whether administered to animals or humans. As used herein the terms \u201canimal\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d is used merely for the purpose of pointing out human beings as opposed to other members of the animal kingdom. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) have therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mammals, and in particular of humans. All of the major subdivisions of the class of mammals (Mammalia) are included within the scope of the present invention with regard to being recipients of therapeutic treatment as described herein. Mammals have value as pets to humans and are therefore likely to be subjects of treatment. This applies especially to the canine and feline groups of mammals. Other mammals are valued as domesticated animals and their treatment in accordance with the present invention is likely in view of the adverse economic impact of not treating the diseases and conditions described herein. This applies especially to the equine, bovine, porcine, and ovine groups of mammals.  \\n       [0427] The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit the PDE4 isozyme and thereby have a wide range of therapeutic applications, as described further below, because of the essential role which the PDE4 family of isozymes plays in the physiology of all mammals. The enzymatic role performed by the PDE4 isozymes is the intracellular hydrolysis of adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cAMP) within pro-inflammatory leukocytes. cAMP, in turn, is responsible for mediating the effects of numerous hormones in the body, and as a consequence, PDE4 inhibition plays a significant role in a variety of physiological processes. There is extensive literature in the art describing the effects of PDE inhibitors on various inflammatory cell responses, which in addition to cAMP elevation, include inhibition of superoxide production, degranulation, chemotaxis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes.  \\n       [0428] PDE4 was first identified in 1985, Nemoz et al.  Biochem. Pharmacol.  34 2997-3000, 1985, and the PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and denbufylline were studied early on in clinical trials for CNS indications such as depression. Subsequently, it was established that PDE4 is the principal phosphodiesterase in inflammatory leukocytes. The four subtypes of PDE4, i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D, are widely distributed in human tissues, as determined by the presence of their mRNAs. PDE4D is expressed in kidney, thymus, small intestine, and colon tissues, and is strongly expressed in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) tissues. It is only weakly expressed in heart, placenta, liver, pancreas, spleen, testes, and ovary tissues. PDE4A and PDE4B are also strongly expressed in brain and skeletal muscle tissues, and only weakly expressed in placenta, liver, and ovary tissues. PDE4C is strongly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue as well, and is also weakly expressed in ovary tissue. PDE4C is usually not detectable in the majority of the above-mentioned tissues.  \\n       [0429] The PDE4 family of isozymes is the predominant form of phosphodiesterase found in cell types implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, and among bone-marrow derived cell types, only platelets do not express PDE. PDE4 is the major cAMP-metabolizing enzyme in immune and inflammatory cells, and is one of two major cAMP-metabolizing enzymes in airway smooth muscle. PDE4 is exclusively present in neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocyctes, while in macrophages PDE3 and PDE1 activity, and in T lymphocytes PDE7 activity has also been demonstrated. The beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of inhibitors of PDE have been demonstrated heretofore using in vitro experiments, which have established that such compounds inhibit superoxide generation in human monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils; mediator release in basophils, macrophages, and neutrophils; and TNF\u03b1 release in monocytes and macrophages. PDE inhibitors also inhibit mediator release of inflammatory cells like monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, lung mast cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils.  \\n       [0430] Beneficial anti-inflammatory effects have also been observed in vivo heretofore, including inhibition of microvascular leakage into the lungs of sensitized guinea pigs, and reduction of bronchial hyper-reactivity and eosinophilia in cynomolgus monkeys following repeated antigen challenge. It has also been demonstrated heretofore that PDE4 inhibitors potently suppress TNF\u03b1 release from mononuclear phagocytes.  \\n       [0431] 8.1 Asthma  \\n       [0432] One of the most important respiratory diseases treatable with PDE4, especially PDE4D inhibitors of the type within the scope of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is asthma, a chronic, increasingly common disorder encountered worldwide and characterized by intermittent reversible airway obstruction, airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation. The cause of asthma has yet to be determined, but the most common pathological expression of asthma is inflammation of the airways, which may be significant even in the airways of patients with mild asthma. Based on bronchial biopsy and lavage studies it has been clearly shown that asthma involves infiltration by mast cells, eosinophils, and T-lymphocytes into a patient&#39;s airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in atopic asthmatics shows activation of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that suggests the presence of a T-helper 2 (Th-2)-like T-cell population.  \\n       [0433] Compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit PDE4 in human eosinophils and are therefore useful in the treatment of atopic and non-atopic asthma. The term \u201catopy\u201d refers to a genetic predisposition toward the development of type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions against common environmental antigens. The most common clinical manifestation is allergic rhinitis, while bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy occur less frequently. Accordingly, the expression \u201catopic asthma\u201d as used herein is intended to be synonymous with \u201callergic asthma\u201d, i.e., bronchial asthma which is an allergic manifestation in a sensitized person. The term \u201cnon-atopic asthma\u201d as used herein is intended to refer to all other asthmas, especially essential or \u201ctrue\u201d asthma, which is provoked by a variety of factors, including vigorous exercise, irritant particles, psychologic stresses, etc.  \\n       [0434] The use of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to treat atopic asthma or non-atopic asthma is established and demonstrated by the models of PDE inhibition, inhibition of eosinophil activation, and the cell infiltration models described below.  \\n       [0435] Pulmonary Inflammation in Allergic Cynomolgus Monkeys  \\n       [0436] The ability of the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention to inhibit Ascaris antigen induced increases in the inflammatory cell content of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid from cynomolgus monkey subjects is evaluated in this method. Using a cross-over design, 8-10 Ascaris-sensitive cynomolgus monkeys are treated with vehicle or drug. At appropriate pretreatment time, each monkey is anesthetized (ketamine 10 m/kg +xylazine 1 mg/kg, i.m.) and intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed using one 15 ml wash of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) delivered through a pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope inserted through the endotracheal tube and wedged into a third to fifth generation bronchus. Lavage fluid is gently aspirated and collected in a syringe. After BAL is complete, each animal receives a 2 min exposure to a concentration of Ascaris suum aerosol which doubles respiratory system resistance determined in previous experiments. Each monkey is returned to its cage and 24 hr later a second lavage is performed, using 15 ml PBS, on the opposite side of the lung. One week after the first trial, control and treated monkeys are reversed and the experiment repeated. To determine the percent composition of each leukocyte type, two slides from each monkey BAL sample is obtained by centrifuging 2\u00d7150 ul lavage fluid for 2 min@500 rpm in Cytospin centrifuge. Slides are stained in Diff-Quick for differential cell count and cells identified by standard morphological criteria. Total leukocyte numbers per milliliter of BAL fluid are determined by diluting 20 \u03bcl of sample in 20 ml Isoton, adding 3 drops of Zapoglobin to lyse erythrocytes and reading the sample using a Coulter Counter. Comparisons are made between the ratio of increase in bronchial alveolar lavage eosinophil, cytokine or mediator levels, pre-antigen challenge versus 24 hours post antigen challenge, with and without drug treatment.  \\n       [0437] In the above test model the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention exhibit anti-inflammatory activity at dosages in the range of from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg i.v. or 0.01 to 10.0 mg/kg p.o. or 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg i.t.  \\n       [0438] Another useful assay, based on the use of primates, is that described in Turner et al., \u201cCharacterization of a primate model of asthma using anti-allergy/anti-asthma agents,\u201d  Inflammation Research  45 239-245, 1996.  \\n       [0439] Anti-Inflammatory Activity  \\n       [0440] The anti-inflammatory activity of the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention is demonstrated by the inhibition of eosinophil activation as measured by sephadex bead stimulated LTE4 production in whole human blood. Whole Blood Assay for LTE4 using Sephadex Beads as Stimulant. On the day before the assay, siliconize glass tubes with Sigmacote (Sigma, Cat# SL-2). Before Drawing the blood, dilute compounds in DMSO 1000\u00d7, add 1 \u03bcl of either DMSO or compound to each respective tube, and place rack of tubes in 37\u00b0 C. water bath. Have Blood drawn into heparinized Vacutainer tube #6480 (143USP units sodium heparin, 10ml), 10 tubes=100 ml blood. Pool Blood tubes in two 50 ml conical tubes. Add 1 ml of whole blood to each siliconized tube containing DMSO or compound VORTEX and then incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. To prepare the Sephadex G-15 beads (Pharmacia, Cat# 17-0020-01) suspension, add 3.3 g. of Sephadex G-15, mix with 20 mls of PBS in a 100 ml beaker then mix with a magnetic stir bar. After 15 minutes, add 100 \u03bcl of Sephadex G-15 beads to each tube except the Sephadex tubes which will provide the baseline value for LTE4 release. Vortex and incubate for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. At the end of 90 minutes incubation, add 20 \u03bcl of 15% EDTA, VORTEX and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. Then remove and save the plasma sample for analysis. LTE4 levels are determined by Cayman&#39;s Cysteinyl-LT ELISA kit (Cat #520501). Percent inhibition is calculated as 100\u00d71\u2014(LTE4 concentration in the drug treated sample divided by the LTE4 concentration in the non-drug treated control samples).  \\n       [0441] Compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are active in the above test method at concentrations in the range of from 0.0001 \u03bcM to 20.0 \u03bcM, with preferred embodiments being active at concentrations in the range of from 0.5 nM to 1000 nM.  \\n       [0442] From the above it may be seen that compounds of Formula (1 0.0) are useful for the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases or other conditions involving airways obstruction. In particular they are useful for the treatment of bronchial asthma.  \\n       [0443] In view of their anti-inflammatory activity, their influence on airways hyper-reactivity, and their profile in relation to PDE isoenzyme inhibition, in particular as selective PDE4 inhibitors, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the treatment, in particular prophylactic treatment, of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. Thus, by continued and regular administration over prolonged periods of time the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in providing advance protection against the recurrence of bronchoconstriction or other symptomatic attack consequential to obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are also useful for the control, amelioration or reversal of the basal status of such diseases.  \\n       [0444] Having regard to their bronchodilator activity the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful as bronchodilators, e.g., in the treatment of chronic or acute bronchoconstriction, and for the symptomatic treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases.  \\n       [0445] The words \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201ctreating\u201d as used throughout the present specification and claims in relation to obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases are to be understood, accordingly, as embracing both prophylactic and symptomatic modes of therapy.  \\n       [0446] In light of the above description, it may be seen that the present invention also relates to a method for the treatment of airways hyper-reactivity in mammals; to a method of effecting bronchodilation in mammals; and in particular, to a method of treating obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases, especially asthma, in a mammal subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said subject mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0447] Obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases to which the present invention applies include asthma; pneumoconiosis; chronic eosinophilic pneumonia; chronic obstructive airways or pulmonary disease (COAD or COPD); and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as exacerbation of airways hyper-reactivity consequent to other drug therapy, e.g., aspirin or \u03b2-agonist therapy.  \\n       [0448] The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of asthma of whatever type, etiology, or pathogenesis; including intrinsic asthma attributed to pathophysiologic disturbances, extrinsic asthma caused by some factor in the environment, and essential asthma of unknown or inapparent cause. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of allergic (atopic/bronchial/IgE-mediated) asthma; and they are useful as well in the treatment of non-atopic asthma, including e.g. bronchitic, emphysematous, exercise-induced, and occupational asthma; infective asthma that is a sequela to microbial, especially bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral infection; and other non-allergic asthmas, e.g., incipient asthma (wheezy infant syndrome).  \\n       [0449] The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of pneumoconiosis of whatever type, etiology, or pathogenesis; including, e.g., aluminosis (bauxite workers&#39; disease); anthracosis (miners&#39; asthma); asbestosis (steam-fitters&#39; asthma); chalicosis (flint disease); ptilosis caused by inhaling the dust from ostrich feathers; siderosis caused by the inhalation of iron particles; silicosis (grinders&#39; disease); byssinosis (cotton-dust asthma); and talc pneumoconiosis.  \\n       [0450] 8.2 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)  \\n       [0451] The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are still further useful in the treatment of COPD or COAD including chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema or dyspnea associated therewith. COPD is characterized by irreversible, progressive airways obstruction. Chronic bronchitis is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mucus secreting glands of the submucosa in the large cartilaginous airways. Goblet cell hyperplasia, mucosal and submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, fibrosis, mucus plugs and increased smooth muscle are all found in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles. The small airways are known to be a major site of airway obstruction. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the alveolar wall and loss of lung elasticity. A number of risk factors have also been identified as linked to the incidence of COPD. The link between tobacco smoking and COPD is well established. Other risk factors include exposure to coal dust and various genetic factors. See Sandford et al., \u201cGenetic risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\u201d  Eur. Respir. J.  10 1380-1391, 1997. The incidence of COPD is increasing and it represents a significant economic burden on the populations of the industrialized nations. COPD also presents itself clinically with a wide range of variation from simple chronic bronchitis without disability to patients in a severely disabled state with chronic respiratory failure.  \\n       [0452] COPD is characterized by inflammation of the airways, as is the case with asthma, but the inflammatory cells that have been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum of patients neutrophils rather than eosinophils. Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators are also found in COPD patients, including IL-8, LTB 4 , and TNF-\u03b1, and the surface epithelium and sub-epithelium of the bronchi of such patients has been found to be infiltrated by T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Symptomatic relief for COPD patients can be provided by the use of \u03b2-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators, but the progress of the disease remains unaltered. COPD has been treated using theophylline, but without much success, even though it reduces neutrophil counts in the sputum of COPD patients. Steroids have also failed to hold out much promise as satisfactory treatment agents in COPD.  \\n       [0453] Accordingly, the use of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to treat COPD and its related and included obstructed airways diseases, represents a significant advance in the art The present invention is not limited to any particular mode of action or any hypothesis as to the way in which the desired therapeutic objectives have been obtained by utilizing the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). However, it is recognized in the art that PDE4 is the predominant PDE in neutrophils and macrophages; Cheng et al., \u201cSynthesis and in vitro profile of a novel series of catechol benzimidazoles. The discovery of potent, selective phosphodiesterase Type IV inhibitors with greatly attenuated affinity for the [3H]rolipram binding site,\u201d  Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.  5 1969-1972, 1995; Wright et al. \u201cDifferential inhibition of human neutrophil functions: role of cyclic AMP-specific, cyclic GMP-insensitive phosphodiesterase,\u201d  Biochem. Pharmacol.  40 699-707, 1990; Schudt et al., \u201cInfluence of selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors on human neutrophil functions and levels of cAMP and Cai,\u201d  Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

Allergy  25 625-633, 1995.  \\n       [0454] In order to provide a better understanding of the present invention, the inference is made here that the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit PDE4s in neutrophils, resulting in reduced chemotaxis, activation, adherence, and degranulation; Schudt et al., Ibid.; Nelson et al., \u201cEffect of selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the polymorphonuclear leukocyte respiratory burst,\u201d  J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.  86 801-808, 1990; and Bloeman et al., \u201cIncreased cAMP levels in stimulated neutrophils inhibit their adhesion to human bronchial epithelial cells,\u201d  Am. J. Physiol.  272 L580-587, 1997.  \\n       [0455] It is also inferred that the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) reduce superoxide anion production mediated by PDE4s in peripheral blood neutrophils, and that they regulate leukotriene synthesis mediated by PDE4s; Wright et al., Ibid.; Schudt et al., Ibid.; Bloeman et al., Ibid.; Al Essa, et al., \u201cHeterogeneity of circulating and exudated polymorphonuclear leukocytes in superoxide-generating response to cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-elevating agents: investigation of the underlying mechanism,\u201d  Biochem. Pharmacol.  49 315-322, 1995; Ottonello et al., \u201cCyclic AMP-elevating agents down-regulate the oxidative burst induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in adherent neutrophils,\u201d  Clin. Exp. Immunol.  101 502-506, 1995; and Ottonello et al., \u201cTumor necrosis factor alpha-induced oxidative burst in neutrophils adherent to fibronectin: effects of cyclic AMP-elevating agents,\u201d  Br. J. Haematol.  91 566-570, 1995.  \\n       [0456] It is further inferred that the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit CD11b/CD18 expression; Berends et al., \u201cInhibition of PAF-induced expression of CD1 lb and shedding of L-selectin on human neutrophils and eosinophils by the type-IV selective PDE inhibitor, rolipram,\u201d  Eur. Respir J.  10 1000-1007, 1997; and Derian et al., \u201cInhibition of chemotactic peptide-induced neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothelium by cAMP modulators,\u201d  J. Immunol.  154 308-317, 1995.  \\n       [0457] It is still further inferred that the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit alveolar macrophage PDE4s, thereby reducing the release of chemotactic factors and TNF-\u03b1; and that the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) increase synthesis and facilitate release from monocytes of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which in turn is capable of decreasing the generation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and GM-CSF by synovial fluid mononuclear cells, thereby augmenting the overall anti-inflammatory profile of the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0); Schudt et al., \u201cPDE isoenzymes as targets for anti-asthma drugs,\u201d  Eur. Respir. J.  8 1179-1183, 1995; and Kambayashi et al., \u201cCyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase Type IV participates in the regulation of IL-10 and the subsequent inhibition of TNF-alpha and IL-6 release by endotoxin-stimulated macrophages,\u201d  J. Immunol.  155 4909-4916, 1995.  \\n       [0458] The application of PDE4 inhibitors to the treatment of COPD in human patients has been demonstrated in clinical trials. Treatment with SB-207,499, represented by Formula (0.1.9) above, at a dose of 15 mg twice a day for six weeks has been shown to result in increrases in FEV 1  and forced vital capacity (FVC); Brown, W. M., \u201cSB-207499 ,\u201d Anti - inflamm. Immunomodulatory Invest. Drugs  1 39-47, 1999. The clinical efficacy of SB-207,499 has also been demonstrated in a four week trial that has provided evidence of improved FEV 1 ; and in a six week study in COPD patients receiving 15 mg twice a day that has also provided evidence of improved FEV 1 ; Brown, Ibid. SB-207,499 has already been described further above and represented by Formula (0.1.9):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0459] 8.3 Bronchitis and Bronchiectasis  \\n       [0460] In accordance with the particular and diverse inhibitory activities described above that are possessed by the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), they are useful in the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type, etiology, or pathogenesis, including, e.g., acute bronchitis which has a short but severe course and is caused by exposure to cold, breathing of irritant substances, or an acute infection; acute laryngotracheal bronchitis which is a form of nondiphtheritic croup; arachidic bronchitis which is caused by the presence of a peanut kernel in a bronchus; catarrhal bronchitis which is a form of acute bronchitis with a profuse mucopurulent discharge; chronic bronchitis which is a long-continued form of bronchitis with a more or less marked tendency to recurrence after stages of quiescence, due to repeated attacks of acute bronchitis or chronic general diseases, characterized by attacks of coughing, by expectoration either scanty or profuse, and by secondary changes in the lung tissue; croupus bronchitis which is characterized by violent cough and paroxysms of dyspnea; dry bronchitis which is characterized by a scanty secretion of tough sputum; infectious asthmatic bronchitis which is a syndrome marked by the development of symptoms of bronchospasm following respiratory tract infections in persons with asthma; productive bronchitis which is bronchitis associated with a productive cough; staphylococcus or streptococcal bronchitis which are caused by staphylococci or streptococci; and vesicular bronchitis in which the inflammation extends into the alveoli, which are sometimes visible under the pleura as whitish-yellow granulations like millet seeds.  \\n       [0461] Bronchiectasis is a chronic dilatation of the bronchi marked by fetid breath and paroxysmal coughing with the expectoration of mucopurulent matter. It may affect the tube uniformly, in which case it is referred to as cylindric bronchiectasis, or it may occur in irregular pockets, in which case it is called sacculated bronchiectasis. When the dilated bronchial tubes have terminal bulbous enlargements, the term fusiform bronchiectasis is used. In those cases where the condition of dilatation extends to the bronchioles, it is referred to as capillary bronchiectasis. If the dilatation of the bronchi is spherical in shape, the condition is referred to as cystic bronchiectasis. Dry bronchiectasis occurs where the infection involved is episodic and it may be accompanied by hemoptysis, the expectoration of blood or of blood-stained sputum. During quiescent periods of dry bronchiectasis, the coughing which occurs is nonproductive. Follicular bronchiectasis is a type of bronchiectasis in which the lymphoid tissue in the affected regions becomes greatly enlarged, and by projection into the bronchial lumen, may seriously distort and partially obstruct the bronchus. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the beneficial treatment of the various above-described types of bronchiectasis as a direct result of their inhibition of PDE4 isozymes.  \\n       [0462] The utility of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) as bronchodilaors or bronchospasmolytic agents for treating bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and related diseases and disorder described herein, is demonstrable through the use of a number of different in vivo animal models known in the art, including those described in the paragraphs below.  \\n       [0463] Bronchospasmolytic Activity in vitro  \\n       [0464] The ability of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to cause relaxation of guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle is demonstrated in the following test procedure. Guinea-pigs (350-500 g) are killed with sodium pentothal (100 mg/kg i.p.). The trachea is dissected and a section 2-3 cm in length is excised. The trachea is transected in the transverse plane at alternate cartilage plates so as to give rings of tissue 3-5 mm in depth. The proximal and distal rings are discarded. Individual rings are mounted vertically on stainless steel supports, one of which is fixed at the base of an organ bath, while the other is attached to an isometric transducer. The rings are bathed in Krebs solution (composition \u03bcM: NaHCO 3  25; NaCl 113; KCl 4.7; MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 1.2; KH 2 PO 4  1.2; CaCl 2  2.5; glucose 11.7) at 37\u00b0 C. and gassed with O 2 /CO 2  (95:5, v/v). Rings prepared in this manner, preloaded to 1 g, generate spontaneous tone and, after a period of equilibration (45-60m), relax consistently on addition of spasmolytic drugs. To ascertain spasmolytic activity, test compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are dissolved in physiological saline and added in increasing quantities to the organ bath at 5 m intervals to provide a cumulative concentration-effect curve.  \\n       [0465] In the above test model, compounds of Formula (1.0.0) produce concentration-related relaxation of guinea-pig tracheal ring preparations at concentrations in the range of from 0.001 to 1.0 \u03bcM.  \\n       [0466] The anti-inflammatory activity of the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention is demonstrated by the inhibition of TNF\u03b1 production in human whole blood stimulated with Lipopolysacharide (LPS). Compounds are analyzed in the presence of beta agonist (10 ng/ml) and Indomethacin (1 uM). Prepare 250 ml assay buffer 200 mM HEPES in RPMI 1640 filtered. The following are performed at room temperature at the bench. Prepare \u201cIP\u201d cocktail in 50 ml polypropylene tube by adding 0.4 ml of Indomethacin (stock 4 mM) and 0.4 ml of beta agonist (stock 0.04 mg/ml) for f.v. 40 ml with assay buffer. Prepare compounds from powder stocks into DMSO to either 200 or 60 mM stock solutions. Make eight-point half-log serial dilutions in glass vials or microtubes. Add 0.01 ml of each compound dilution to the 5 ml polypropylene tubes where 0.490 ml assay buffer and 0.50 ml \u201cIP\u201d cocktail is added for f.v. 1.0 ml. (The compounds&#39; assay f.c. 100-0.1 uM.) Prepare LPS solution such that 0.08 ml LPS (stock 1 mg/ml) is added to 40 ml assay buffer for f.c. 2 ug/ml. 6. Prepare a 2% DMSO solution by adding 200 ul DMSO to 9.8 ml assay buffer. Add 10 ml of IP cocktail to the 2% DMSO solution. This cocktail is used for control wells such that Indomethacin assay f.c. is 1 uM and beta agonist f.c. is 10 ng/ml. The following are performed under the tissue culture hood. Add 0.0125 ml of diluted compound to appropriate well in U-bottom sterile Costar 96-well plate #3790. Add 0.0125 ml LPS to all wells (f.c. 0.1 ug/ml) except negative control wells. Fresh human whole blood is drawn (22 ml per 96-well plate) usually four green tops per donor into sterile heparin tubes kept at 37\u00b0 C. Add 0.225 ml of whole blood to the plates. Cover, incubate at 37\u00b0 C., and rock for four hours. Centrifuge the plates at 2OOrpm for 10 minutes. Prepare ELISA standards. Remove 100 ul serum into flat bottom plate. Dilute 1:20 by removing 15 ul and adding 285 ul RD6 diluent. Freeze @\u221220\u00b0 C. For analysis, thaw and add 200 ul to R &amp; D Systems TNF\u03b1 ELISA. Process the plates according to R &amp; D Systems protocol. Read plate at 450 nm using SoftMax Pro. Analyze and interpret with Java Fitter in order to determine IC50 values. A dose response curve of data expressed as percent control is plotted. A minimum of six triplicate points are generated for each compound. The IC50 values are calculated using the Java Fitter curve-fitting program under the \u201cIC50 fix both\u201d parameter.  \\n       [0467] In the above test model, combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention produce concentration-related inhibition of TNF\u03b1 production at concentrations in the range of from 0.001 to 1.0 \u03bcM.  \\n       [0468] 8.4 Allergic and Other Types of Rhinitis; Sinusitis  \\n       [0469] Allergic rhinitis is characterized by nasal obstruction, itching, watery rhinorrhea, sneezing and occasional anosmia. Allergic rhinitis is divided into two disease categories, seasonal and perennial, in which the former is attributed to pollen or outdoor mould spores, while the latter is attributed to common allergens such as house dust mites, animal danders, and mould spores. Allergic rhinitis generally exhibits an early phase response and a late phase response. The early phase response is associated with mast cell degranulation, while the late phase response is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and T-lymphocytes. A variety of inflammatory mediators is also released by these cells, all of which may contribute to the inflammation exhibited in the late phase response.  \\n       [0470] A particularly prevalent form of seasonal allergic rhinitis is hay fever, which is marked by acute conjunctivitis with lacrimation and itching, swelling of the nasal mucosa, nasal catarrh, sudden attacks of sneezing, and often with asthmatic symptoms. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are especially useful in the beneficial treatment of hay fever.  \\n       [0471] Other types of rhinitis for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) may be used as therapeutic agents include acute catarrhal rhinitis which is a cold in the head involving acute congestion of the mucous membrane of the nose, marked by dryness and followed by increased mucous secretion from the membrane, impeded respiration through the nose, and some pain; atrophic rhinitis which is a chronic form marked by wasting of the mucous membrane and the glands; purulent rhinitis which is chronic rhinitis with the formation of pus; and vasomotor rhinitis which is a non-allergic rhinitis in which transient changes in vascular tone and permeability with the same symptoms as allergic rhinitis, are brought on by such stimuli as mild chilling, fatigue, anger, and anxiety.  \\n       [0472] There is a recognized link between allergic rhinitis and asthma. Allergic rhinitis is a frequent accompaniment to asthma, and it has been demonstrated that treating allergic rhinitis will improve asthma. Epidemiologic data has also been used to show a link between severe rhinitis and more severe asthma. For example, the compound D-22888, under preclinical development for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, has been shown to exhibit a strong anti-allergic affect and to inhibit rhinorrhea in the antigen-challenged pig. See, Marx et 30 al \u201cD-22888- a new PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and other allergic disorders,\u201d  J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.  99 S444, 1997. Another experimental compound, AWD-12,281 has been shown to be active in a rat model of allergic rhinitis. See Poppe et al \u201cEffect of AWD 12-281, a new selective PDE-4 inhibitor, loteprednol and beclomethasone in models of allergic rhinitis and airway inflammation in brown norway-rats,\u201d  Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. A 95, 1999. The compounds D-22888 and AWD-12,281 have already been described further above and represented by Formulas (0.0.28) and (0.0.34), respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0473] Sinusitis is related to rhinitis in terms of anatomical proximity as well as a shared etiology and pathogenesis in some cases. Sinusitis is the inflammation of a sinus and this condition may be purulent or nonpurulent, as well as acute or chronic. Depending upon the sinus where the inflammation is located, the condition is known as ethmoid, frontal, maxillary, or sphenoid sinusitis. The ethmoidal sinus is one type of paranasal sinus, located in the ethmoid bone. The frontal sinus is one of the paired paranasal sinuses located in the frontal bone. The maxillary sinus is one of the paired paranasal sinuses located in the body of the maxilla. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the beneficial treatment of acute or chronic sinusitis, but especially of chronic sinusitis.  \\n       [0474] 8.5 Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Pain, Fever, and Gout  \\n       [0475] Arthritis is defined as inflammation of the joints, and rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic disease primarily of the joints, usually polyarticular, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, and by muscular atrophy and rarefaction of the bones. Late stages of rheumatoid arthritis are marked by ankylosis and deformity. Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling autoimmune disease of unknown etiology which affects over 1% of the population.  \\n       [0476] As used herein, the term \u201crheumatoid arthritis\u201d is intended to include within its scope where applicable related and associated forms of arthritis well known In the art, since these may also be treated with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). Accordingly, the term \u201crheumatoid arthritis\u201d includes acute arthritis, which is arthritis marked by pain, heat, redness, and swelling due to inflammation, infection, or trauma; acute gouty arthritis, which is acute arthritis associated with gout; chronic inflammatory arthritis, which is inflammation of the joints in chronic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis; degenerative arthritis, which is osteoarthritis; infectious arthritis, which is arthritis caused by bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, viruses, fungi, or parasites; Lyme arthritis, which is arthritis of the large joints associated with Lyme 20 disease; proliferative arthritis, which is inflammation of the joints with proliferation of the synovium, seen in rheumatoid arthritis; psoriatic arthritis, which is a syndrome in which psoriasis occurs in association with inflammatory arthritis; and vertebral arthritis, which is inflammation involving the intervertebral disks.  \\n       [0477] The three major pathological features of rheumatoid arthritis that are responsible for progressive joint destruction are inflammation, abnormal cellular and humoral responses, and synovial hyperplasia. The particular cellular pathology of rheumatoid arthritis includes the presence of T-cells and monocytes. The T-cells, which are predominantly memory T-cells, constitute up to 50% of the cells recovered from the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients; and of the monocytes found in the same tissue, 30-50% are antigen presenting cells, which is indicative of the autoimmune character of the disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-\u03b1, are the major contributors to joint tissue damage, inflammation, hyperplasia, pannus formation and bone resorption. See Firestein,.G. S. and Zvaifier, W. J., \u201cHow important are T-cells in chronic rheumatoid synovitis?\u201d  Arth. Rheum.  33 768-773, 1990. This has been demonstrated, e.g., by the fact that monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to TNF-\u03b1 have shown promise in RA clinical trials; Maini el al, \u201cBeneficial effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1 blockade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA),\u201d  Clin. Exp. Immunol.  101 207-212, 1995.  \\n       [0478] The PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as a result of their ability to suppress the activity of a variety of inflammatory cells, including basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells. These inhibitory activities of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) have already been described further above, as has their wide range of in vitro anti-inflammatory action via the release of reactive oxygen species, prostaglandins, and inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-5, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. See further Cohan et al, \u201cIn vitro pharmacology of the novel phosphodiesterase Type IV inhibitor, CP-80,633 ,\u201d J. Pharm. Exp. Ther.  278 1356-1361, 1996; and Barnette et al, \u201cSB207499 (Ariflo), a potent and selective second generation phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor: in vitro anti-inflammatory actions,\u201d  J. Pharm. Exp. Ther.  284 420-426, 1998. The PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are also useful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as a result of their effectiveness in inhibiting T-cell proliferation mediated via a number of different agents, including antigens such as house dust mite, which has been demonstrated in the art; Barnette el al, Ibid. The ability of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to facilitate the release of cytokine IL-10 from monocytes, which in turn is capable of decreasing the generation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and GM-CSF by synovial fluid mononuclear cells, further augments the overall anti-inflammatory profile of the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula(1.0.0); Kambayashi el al, Ibid. Further, the ability of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 release from stimulated monocytes can be correlated with animal models of inflammation in which anti-inflammatory effects can be shown to correspond to suppression of TNF-\u03b1 accumulation. One such animal model involves inhibition of LPS induced TNF-\u03b1 release in mice by oral administration of a PDE4 inhibitor; Cheng et al, \u201cThe phosphodiesterase Type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor CP-80,633 elevates cyclic AMP levels and decreases TNF-\u03b1 production in mice: effect of adrenalectomy,\u201d  J. Pharm. Exp. Ther.  280 621-626, 1997. Another such animal model involves the inhibition of rat paw edema, induced by carageenan, by oral administration of rolipram; Singh el al, \u201cSynovial fluid levels of tumor necrosis factor a in the inflamed rat knee: Modulation by dexamethasone and inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and phosphodiesterases,\u201d  Inflamm. Res.  46(Suppl. 2) S153-S154, 1997.  \\n       [0479] Gout refers to a group of disorders of purine metabolism, and fully developed gout is manifested by various combinations of hyperuricemia, recurrent, characteristic acute inflammatory arthritis induced by crystals of monosodium urate monohydrate, tophaceous deposits of said crystals in and around the joints of the extremities, which may lead to joint destruction and severe crippling, and uric acid urolithiasis. Rheumatic gout is another name for rheumatoid arthritis. Tophaceous gout is gout in which there are tophi or chalky deposits of sodium urate. Some therapeutic agents are useful in treating both gout and its attendant inflammation, e.g., phenylbutazone and colchicine; while other therapeutic agents possess only uricosuric properties, e.g., sulfinpyrazone and benzbromarone.  \\n       [0480] Fever, or pyrexia, may be the result of any one of a large number of different factors, but with regard to the present invention such fever is either that manifested in pharyngoconjunctival fever or rheumatic fever, or that manifested during inflammation. A concomitant of inflammation is pain, especially that experienced in the joints and connective tissue of those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and gout.  \\n       [0481] Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) provide beneficial results in the treatment of gout, and fever and pain associated with inflammation.  \\n       [0482] Animal models of rheumatoid arthritis have also been used in the art for the purpose of demonstrating the correlation between in vivo modulation of TNF-\u03b1 by PDE4 inhibitors and their utility in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The activity of rolipram in animal models of acute inflammation such as the mouse adjuvant arthritis model, has been demonstrated in the art; Sekut et al, \u201cAnti-inflammatory activity of phosphodiesterase (PDE) IV inhibitors in acute and chronic models of inflammation,\u201d  Olin. Exp. Immunol.  100(1) 126-132, 1995. The ability of rolipram to reduce disease severity in the collagen 11 induced arthritis (CIA) model after sc. or i.p. injection has been demonstrated in the art; Nyman et al, \u201cAmelioration of collagen 11 induced arthritis in rats by Type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram,\u2019  Olin. Exp. ImmunoL  108 415-419, 1997. In this study the dosing regimen for rolipram was 2 mg/kg twice daily for five days before the onset of arthritis, and it significantly delayed the appearance of arthritic symptoms. After the cessation of treatment the test animals developed arthritis and reached the same arthritis top score as the control group. In the same study rolipram was also administered at 3 mg/kg twice daily at the time point when arthritis was apparent. This treatment drastically changed the development of the disease whereby progression of severity was halted and even after the cessation of treatment, the arthritis score did not reach the levels observed in untreated animals. The investigators were also able to demonstrate a strong down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in regional lymph nodes, which suggests that the major effect of rolipram is exerted in the effector phase of the inflammatory process. Nyman et al, Ibid.  \\n       [0483] Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 Production by Human Monocytes in vitro  \\n       [0484] The inhibitory effect of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) on in vitro TNF-\u03b1 production by human monocytes may be determined in accordance with the protocol described in EP 411 754 (Badger et a/) and WO 90/15534 (Hanna). The referenced publications also describe two models of endotoxic shock which may be used to determine in vivo inhibitory activity of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). The protocols used in these models are detailed and test compounds demonstrate a positive result by reducing serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 induced by the injection of endotoxin.  \\n       [0485] Selective PDE4 inhibitors such as RP73401 have been shown to exhibit significant amelioration of disease, especially improvements in joint destruction, synovitis, and fibrosis, in animal models such as those involving streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis; Souness et al, \u201cPotential of phosphodiesterase Type IV inhibitors in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,\u201d  Drugs  1 541-553, 1998.  \\n       [0486] Of particular interest to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is the observation that PDE4 inhibitors have positive effects at the site of action of the disease. For example, RP73401 has been demonstrated to decrease TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression at the pannus/cartilage interface of paw joints of collagen 11 treated mice. Souness et al, ibid RP73401 has also been studied clinically in rheumatoid arthritis patients in a placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase II study of 35 rheumatoid arthritis patients administered 400 \u03bcg of the compound t.i.d. The compound was able to induce a positive trend towards clinical improvement associated with a reduction in C-reactive protein and IL-6 serum levels. Chikanza et al, \u201cThe clinical effects of RP73401 phosphodiesterase Type 4 inhibitor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,\u201d  Br. J. Rheumatol.  36:Abstr. Suppl. I, 186, 1997.  \\n       [0487] Assaying Increased cAMP Accumulation in Intact Tissues Using U-937 Cells  \\n       [0488] Another assay suitable for demonstrating the PDE4 inhibiting activity of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is one which utilizes U-937 cells from a human monocyte cell line that has been shown to contain a large amount of PDE4. In order to assess the inhibition of PDE4 activity in intact cells, non-differentiated U-937 cells at a density of approximately 10 5  cells per reaction tube are incubated with concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1000 pM of test compound for one minute, and with 1 \u03bcM of prostagiandin E2 for an additional four minutes. Five minutes after initiating the reaction, cells are lysed by the addition of 17.5% perchloric acid, after which the pH is brought to neutral by the addition of 1 \u03bcM potassium carbonate. The cAMP content of the reaction tube is measured using RIA techniques. A detailed protocol for carrying out this assay is described in Brooker et al, \u201cRadioimmunoassay of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP,\u201d  Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res.  10 1-33, 1979.  \\n       [0489] 8.6 Eosinophil-Related Disorders  \\n       [0490] The ability of the PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to inhibit eosinophil activation as part of their overall anti-inflammatory activity has been described above. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the therapeutic treatment of eosinophil-related disorders. Such disorders include eosinophilia, which is the formation and accumulation of an abnormally large number of eosinophils in the blood. The name of the disorder derives from \u201ceosin\u201d, a rose-colored stain or dye comprising a bromine derivative of fluorescein which readily stains \u201ceosinophilic leukocytes\u201d in the blood of patients who are thus readily identified. A particular eosinophilic disorder that can be treated in accordance with the present invention is pulmonary infiltration eosinophilia, which is characterized by the infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma by eosinophils. This disorder includes especially Loffler&#39;s syndrome, which is a condition characterized by transient infiltrations of the lungs, accompanied by cough, fever, dyspnea, and eosinophilia.  \\n       [0491] Other eosinophilic disorders include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, which is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by cough, dyspnea, malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, eosinophilia, and a chest film revealing non-segmental, non-migratory infiltrates in the lung periphery; tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, which is a subacute or chronic form of occult filariasis, usually involving  Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti , or filariae that infect animals, occurs in the tropics, and is characterized by episodic nocturnal wheezing and coughing, strikingly elevated eosinophilia, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrations of the lungs; bronchopneumonic aspergillosis, which is an infection of the bronchi and lungs by Aspergillus funga resulting in a diseased condition marked by inflammatory granulomatous lesions in the nasal sinuses and lungs, but also in the skin, ear, orbit, and sometimes in the bones and meninges, and leading to aspergilloma, the most common type of fungus ball formed by colonization of Aspergillus in a bronchus or lung cavity.  \\n       [0492] The term \u201cgranulomatous\u201d means containing granulomas, and the term \u201cgranuloma\u201d refers to any small nodular delimited aggregation of mononuclear inflammatory cells or such a collection of modified macrophages resembling epithelial cells, usually surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes, with fibrosis commonly seen around the lesion. Some granulomas contain eosinophils. Granuloma formation represents a chronic inflammatory response initiated by various infectious and noninfectious agents. A number of such granulomatous conditions are treatable using a compound of Formula (1.0.0), e.g., allergic granulomatous angiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, which is a form of systemic necrotizing vasculitis in which there is prominent lung involvement, generally manifested by eosinophilia, granulomatous reactions, and usually severe asthma. A related disorder is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), which is marked by multiple inflammatory and destructive arterial lesions and is a form of systemic necrotizing vasculitis involving the small and medium-sized arteries with signs and symptoms resulting from infarction and scarring of the affected organ system, in particular the lungs. Other eosinophil-related disorders which may be treated in accordance with the present invention are those affecting the airways which are induced or occasioned by a reaction to a therapeutic agent unrelated to any compound of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0493] 8.7 Atopic Dermatitis, Urticaria, Conjunctivitis, and Uveitis  \\n       [0494] Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder seen in individuals with a hereditary predisposition to a lowered cutaneous threshold to pruritis, that is often accompanied by allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and asthma, and that is principally characterized by extreme itching. Atopic dermatitis is also called allergic dermatitis, and allergic or atopic eczema.  \\n       [0495] Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in young children, and it affects from 10% to 15% of the population during childhood. Atopic dermatitis is frequently associated with asthma and allergies and it has therefore become known as a component of the so-called \u201catopic triad\u201d, since it occurs frequently in individuals with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. See Leung Dym,  Atopic Dermatitis: From Pathogenesis To Treatment , R.G. Landes Co., Austin, Tex., 1-226, 1996. Accordingly, the immune dysfunction associated with atopic dermatitis is treatable with therapeutic agents that are inhibitors of PDE4. For example, rolipram, Ro-201724, and denbufylline have been reported to produce a concentration-related inhibition of the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBM) from normal patients as well as from subjects with atopic dermatitis. See, respectively, Torphy et al,  Drugs and the Lung , Eds. Page and Metzger, Raven Press, New York, 1994; and O&#39;Brien,  Mol. Medicine Today,  369, 1997. These studies also determined that the proliferative response of HPBM from atopic dermatitis patients was more sensitive to PDE4 inhibition than was the proliferation observed in HPBM from normal subjects.  \\n       [0496] Th2 type cytokine secreting T-cells expressing the cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen play a central role in the induction of local IgE responses and the recruitment of eosinophils in this disease. The chronic inflammation seen in atopic dermatitis is considered to be the result of several interdependent factors, such as repeated or persistent allergen exposure, which can lead to Th2 cell expansion. It has been demonstrated that there is an increased frequency of allergen specific T-cells producing increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-3 levels in the blood of atopic dermatitis patients. See Leung Dym et al., \u201cAllergic and immunological skin disorders,\u201d  JAMA  278(22) 1914-1923, 1997. This is significant because IL-4 and IL-3 induce the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), an adhesion molecule involved in the migration of mononuclear cells and eosinophils into sites of tissue inflammation. Further, IL-5 is a key mediator of eosinophil activation, which is a common feature of atopic disease.  \\n       [0497] Increased concentration of cAMP in lymphocytes and basophils has long been known to be associated with decreased mediator release from those cells, and more recently it has been reported that histamine acting on H2 receptors increases cAMP levels and inhibits IL-4 production in murine Th2 cells. It is surmised, accordingly, that there is present in atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, impaired p-adrenergic responses or enhanced PDE4 activity of leukocyte inflammatory responses. A diminished cAMP response may result from an enhanced PDE4 activity that has a genetic basis or that is an acquired condition.  \\n       [0498] Studies have been carried out which compare different cell types from atopic patients with those from healthy volunteers, and the results have shown that increased cAMP-PDE activity in atopic cells correlates with abnormal inflammatory and immune cell function in atopic dermatitis. Further, the PDE4 enzyme from atopic leukocytes is more sensitive to PDE4 inhibitors than the PDE4 enzyme from normal leukocytes, and up to a 14-Fold difference has been demonstrated. See Chan and Hanifin, \u201cDifferential inhibitory effects of cAMP phosphodiesterase isoforms in atopic and normal leukocytes,\u201d  J. Lab. Clin. Med.,  121(1) 44-51, 1993. An increased sensitivity can also be seen in the inhibition of proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic donors on treatment with PDE4 inhibitors. For example, rolipram has been found to be more effective at inhibiting PHA stimulated atopic dermatitis PBMC proliferation than at inhibiting PHA stimulated normal PBMC proliferation, with an IC 50 =280 nM compared to an IC 50 =2600 nM, respectively.  \\n       [0499] Further, it has been shown that a structurally diverse range of selective PDE4 inhibitors are effective in reducing skin eosinophilia in the guinea pig which has been mediated via a range of agents such as PAF, arachidonic acid, zymosan activated plasma, and protein of cutaneous anaphylaxis. See Beasley et al., \u201cSynthesis and evaluation of a novel series of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. A potential treatment for asthma,\u201d  Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letts.  8 2629-2634, 1998. Such data shows the utility of PDE4 inhibitors in treating eosinophil driven skin diseases. Such treatment is by means of topical administration, e.g., topical atizoram applied bilaterally over eight days to twenty patients in a clinical trial has been found to effectively inhibit all of the inflammatory parameters tested, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements with no adverse effects. See Hanifin et al., \u201cType 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitors have clinical and in vitro anti-inflammatory effects in atopic dermatitis,\u201d  J. Invest. Dermatol.  107 51-56, 1996.  \\n       [0500] Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of atopic dermatitis as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in the treatment of urticaria. Urticaria is a vascular reaction, usually transient, involving the upper dermis, representing localized edema caused by dilatation and increased permeability of the capillaries, and marked by the development of wheals or hives. Many different stimuli are capable of inducing an urticarial reaction, and it may be classified according to precipitating causes, as: immune-mediated, complement-mediated which may involve immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms, urticariogenic material-induced, physical agent-induced, stress-induced, or idiopathic. The condition may also be designated acute or chronic depending on the duration of an attack. Angioedema is the same response in the deep dermis or subcutaneous or submucosal tissues.  \\n       [0501] The most common types of urticaria which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are cholinergic urticaria which is characterized by the presence of distinctive punctate wheals surrounded by areas of erythema, thought to be a nonimmunologic hypersensitivity reaction in which acetylcholine released from parasympathetic or motor nerve terminals induces release of mediators from mast cells, and evoked by conditions of exertion, stress, or increased environmental heat; cold urticaria which is urticaria precipitated by cold air, water, or objects, occurring in two forms: In the autosomal dominant form which is associated with fevers, arthralgias, and leukocytosis, the lesions present are erythematous, burning papules and macules, and in the more common acquired form which is usually idiopathic and self-limited; contact urticaria which is a localized or generalized transient wheal-and-flare response elicited by exposure to rapidly absorbable urticariogenic agents; giant urticaria which is angioedema; and papular urticaria which is a persistent cutaneous eruption representing a hypersensitivity reaction to insect bites.  \\n       [0502] Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of urticaria as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in various ophthalmic uses, in particular in the treatment of conjunctivitis and uveitis.  \\n       [0503] The conjunctiva is a delicate membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the exposed surface of the sclera. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva that generally consists of conjunctival hyperemia associated with a discharge. The most common types of conjunctivitis, which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), are actinic conjunctivitis produced by ultraviolet light; acute catarrhal conjunctivitis which is an acute, infectious conjunctivitis associated with cold or catarrh and characterized by vivid hyperemia, edema, loss of translucence, and mucous or mucopurulent discharge; acute contagious conjunctivitis which is a mucopurulent, epidemic conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus aegyptius that has the same symptoms as acute catarrhal conjunctivitis and is also called \u201cpinkeye\u201d; allergic conjunctivitis which is a component of hay fever; atopic conjunctivitis which is allergic conjunctivitis of the immediate type caused by airborne allergens, e.g., pollens, dusts, spores, and animal dander; chronic catarrhal conjunctivitis which is a mild, chronic conjunctivitis with only slight hyperemia and mucous discharge; purulent conjunctivitis which is an acute conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or viruses, particularly gonococci, meningococci, pneumococci, and streptococci, and characterized by severe inflammation of the conjunctiva and copious discharge of pus; and vernal conjunctivitis which is a bilateral conjunctivitis of seasonal occurrence, of unknown cause, affecting children especially boys and characterized by flattened papules and a thick, gelatinous exudate. Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of conjunctivitis as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in the treatment of uveitis.  \\n       [0504] The uvea is the vascular middle coat or tunic of the eye, comprising the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis is an inflammation of all or part of the uvea and commonly involves the other tunics of the eye, i.e., the sclera and the cornea, and the retina as well. The most common types of uveitis, which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), are anterior uveitis which is uveitis involving the structures of the iris and/or ciliary body, including iritis, cyclitis, and iridocyclitis; granulomatous uveitis which is uveitis of any part of the uveal tract but particularly of the posterior portion, characterized by nodular collections of epithelioid cells and giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes; nongranulomatous uveitis which is inflammation of the anterior portion of the uveal tract, i.e., the iris and ciliary body; phacoantigenic uveitis which is one of the lens-induced uveitides is a severe anterior uveitis similar to sympathetic ophthalmia, observed weeks or even months after extracapsular lens surgery or other trauma to the capsule; and posterior uveitis which is uveitis involving the posterior segment of the eye, including choroiditis and chorioretinitis. Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of unveitis as described above.  \\n       [0505] 8.8 Psoriasis  \\n       [0506] Psoriasis is a common chronic, squamous dermatosis with polygenic inheritance and a fluctuating course that is characterized by microabscesses and spongiform pustules, as well as erythematous, dry, scaling patches of various sizes. Psoriasis is a common skin disease that affects approximately 2% of the population, and more than 1\u00bd million patients in the US annually consult physicians for treatment. Psoriasis is usually recurrent and in some instances can be very debilitating. The etiology of psoriasis is unknown, but it appears to be an autoimmune disease with genetic predisposition.  \\n       [0507] Psoriasis involves a large T-cell infiltration in the affected regions of the skin, with CD4+ lymphocytes in the dermis and CD8+ lymphocytes in the epidermis. These lymphocytes secrete IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which alter keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Further, from 5% to 10% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis, the symptoms of which are very similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. The broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities displayed by PDE4 inhibitors, already discussed above, enables such inhibitors to be used beneficially in the treatment of psoriasis.  \\n       [0508] It has been demonstrated that treatment of epidermal basal cells, in primary culture, with the PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 leads to a three-fold increase in cAMP concentrations. It has also been shown that treatment of psoriatic epidermal slices and keratomed psoriatic epidermal slices with Ro 20-1724 results in a very marked elevation of cAMP concentrations over controls. Specifically, a 1395% increase in cAMP concentration in keratomed psoriatic epidermis has been observed. PDE4 inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit the inflammatory response of a number of mediators via either topical or systemic administration. For example, rolipram has been shown to inhibit croton oil-induced ear inflammation in the mouse at topical doses as low as 0.03 mg per ear. The selective PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 has also been investigated in two double-blind studies comparing its effectiveness to vehicle, where it has been shown to improve psoriatic lesions without adverse systemic or cutaneous effects.  \\n       [0509] 8.9 Multiple Sclerosis and Other Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases  \\n       [0510] A sclerosis is an induration, or hardening, and refers especially to hardening of a part from inflammation, and from increased formation of connective tissue and in diseases of the interstitial substance. The term \u201csclerosis\u201d is used chiefly for such a hardening of the nervous system due to the deposition of connective tissue, or to designate hardening of the blood vessels. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which there are foci of demyelination of various sizes throughout the white matter of the central nervous system, sometimes extending into the gray matter, resulting in weakness, incoordination, paresthesias, speech disturbances, and visual complaints. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of unknown etiology with a prolonged course involving many remissions and relapses.  \\n       [0511] Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that in addition to chronic inflammation and demyelination, also results in gliosis within the central nervous system. There are several disease subtypes, including primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. These disease subtypes may be distinguished from each other on the basis of the course of the disease, of the type of inflammation involved, and through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is also possible for the basic disease mechanism to change during the course of multiple sclerosis, with an inflammation-based process being replaced later by one which involves demyelination and axonal damage. See Weilbach and Gold, \u201cDisease modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis. What is on the horizon?\u201d  CNS Drugs  11 133-157, 1999.  \\n       [0512] In multiple sclerosis inflammatory lesions are localized to, but prevalent throughout the white matter of the central nervous system, although sclerotic plaques characterized by demyelination are a hallmark of the disease. The development of demyelination, in turn, is caused by the necrosis of oligodendrocytes, and demyelination is associated with an infiltrate composed mainly of T-cells and macrophages, which together with local cells such as astrocytes, microglia and microvascular brain endothelial cells, express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. These cells are thus implicated in antigen presentation and an inflammatory response, and a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 have been identified in the brain tissue of multiple sclerosis patients and their presence is generally associated with active lesions. TNF-\u03b1 in particular has been the focus of attention because it mediates myelin and oligodendrocyte damage in vitro, induces astrocytes to express surface adhesion molecules, and is associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier.  \\n       [0513] Animal models have been used to demonstrate the role of TNF-\u03b1 in multiple sclerosis, e.g., in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) administration of anti-TNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptors has been shown to provide a protective effect. See Selmaj et al., \u201cPrevention of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by soluble tumor necrosis factor,\u201d  J. Neuroimmunol.  56 135-141, 1995. A direct correlation between the level of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and progression of EAE has also been reported. See Reeno et al., \u201cTNF-alpha expression by resident microglia and infiltrating leukocytes in the central nervous system of mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis: regulation by the Th1 cytokines,\u201d  J. Immunol.  154 944-953, 1995. Further evidence demonstrating that TNF-\u03b1 is a mediator of multiple sclerosis is the increased concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients during the course of the disease. Further, a transgenic mouse overexpressing TNF-\u03b1 in the central nervous system has shown signs of spontaneous demyelination, while a transgenic TNF-\u03b1 knockout mouse has shown a protective effect. See Probert et al., \u201cSpontaneous inflammatory demyelinating disease in transgenic mice showing central nervous system-specific expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha,\u201d  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA  92 11294-11298, 1995; and Liu et al., \u201cTNF is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in autoimmune-mediated demyelination,\u201d  Nature Med.  4 78-83, 1998.  \\n       [0514] Since PDE4 inhibitors also reduce TNF-\u03b1, they are beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis because TNF-\u03b1 plays a key role in mediating multiple sclerosis, as discussed above. For example, in a marmoset model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis rolipram has been found to suppress the appearance of clinical signs and abolish abnormalities in MRI imaging. In another study of the effects of rolipram on chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL mice, it has been shown that rolipram ameliorates clinical signs and pathological changes in this model. See Genain et al., \u201cPrevention of autoimmune demyelination in non-human primates by a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase,\u201d  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc! USA.  92 3601-3605, 1995; and Sommer et al., \u201cTherapeutic potential of phosphodiesterase Type 4 inhibition in chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease,\u201d  J. Neuroimmunol.  79 54-61, 1997.  \\n       [0515] In addition to inhibiting PDE4 activity and the production of TNF-\u03b1, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also possess activity as immunosuppressive agents and are especially useful for treating autoimmune diseases in which inflammation is a component part of the autoimmune disease, or in which inflammation is part of the etiology of the autoimmune disease, or in which inflammation is otherwise involved with the autoimmune disease. Alternatively, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are anti-inflammatory agents useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases in which autoimmune reactions are a component part of the inflammatory disease, or in which autoimmune reactions are part of the etiology of the inflammatory disease, or in which autoimmune reactions are otherwise involved with the inflammatory disease. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, as discussed in detail further above.  \\n       [0516] Other autoimmune/inflammatory diseases that can be treated by therapeutic agents comprising the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) include, but are not limited to, autoimmune hematological disorders such as hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, pure red cell anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; systemic lupus erythematosus; polychondritis; scleroderma; Wegner&#39;s granulomatosis; dermatomyositis; chronic active hepatitis; myasthenia gravis; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; idiopathic sprue; autoimmune inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#39;s disease; endocrin opthamopathy; Grave&#39;s disease; sarcoidosis; alveolitis; chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis; primary biliary cirrhosis; juvenile diabetes (diabetes mellitus type I); anterior uveitis and granulomatous (posterior) uveitis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis; diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (interstitial lung fibrosis); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; cystic fibrosis; psoriatic arthritis; glomerulonephritis with and without nephrotic syndrome, including acute glomerulonephritis, idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and minimal change nephropathy; inflammatory/hyperproliferative skin diseases including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis discussed in detail further above, contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, benign familial pemphigus, pemphigus erythematosus, pemphigus foliaceus, and pemphigus vulgaris.  \\n       [0517] Further, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) may be used as immunosuppressant agents for the prevention of allogeneic graft rejection following organ transplantation, where such organs typically include tissue from bone marrow, bowel, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, skin and cornea.  \\n       [0518] 8.10 Inflammatory Bowel Disease  \\n       [0519] Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, recurrent ulceration in the colon, chiefly of the mucosa and submucosa, which is of unknown cause, and which is manifested clinically by cramping abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and loose discharges of blood, pus, and mucus with scanty fecal particles. Related diseases of the bowel include collagenous colitis, which is a type of colitis of unknown etiology that is characterized by deposits of collagenous material beneath the epithelium of the colon, and marked by crampy abdominal pain with a conspicuous reduction in fluid and electrolyte absorption that leads to watery diarrhea; colitis polyposa, which is ulcerative colitis associated with the formation of pseudopolyps, i.e., edematous, inflamed islands of mucosa between areas of ulceration; and transmural colitis, which is inflammation of the full thickness of the bowel, rather than mucosal and submucosal disease, usually with the formation of noncaseating granulomas, that clinically resembles ulcerative colitis but in which the ulceration is often longitudinal or deep, the disease is often segmental, stricture formation is common, and fistulas, particularly in the perineum, are a frequent complication.  \\n       [0520] Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology involving any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but commonly involving the terminal ileum with scarring and thickening of the bowel wall, frequently leading to intestinal obstruction, and fistula and abscess formation, and having a high rate of recurrence after treatment. Ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#39;s disease and the related diseases discussed above are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These diseases are chronic, spontaneously relapsing disorders of unknown cause that are immunologically mediated and whose pathogenesis has been established through the use of animal models and advanced immunological techniques. See Bickston and Caminelli, \u201cRecent developments in the medical therapy of IBD,\u201d  Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol.  14 6-10, 1998; and Murthy et al., \u201cInflammatory bowel disease: A new wave of therapy,\u201d  Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents  8(7) 785-818, 1998. While the incidence of ulcerative colitis has remained relatively stable, the incidence of Crohn&#39;s disease has increased significantly.  \\n       [0521] Current therapy for inflammatory bowel disease includes 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate. These agents have a wide range of adverse side effects and do not modify the disease itself, and there is thus an ongoing need for more effective treatment agents. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are able to beneficially treat inflammatory bowel diseases as a result of their ability to inhibit the production of TNF-\u03b1, because TNF-\u03b1 causes immune cell activation, proliferation, and mediator release in inflammatory bowel disease. See Radford-Smith and Jewell, \u201cCytokines and inflammatory bowel disease.\u201d  Baillieres Clin. Gasteroenterol.  10 151-164, 1996. TNF-\u03b1 has also been detected in the stools and intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Further, early clinical studies in Crohn&#39;s disease using TNF monoclonal antibodies have shown significant promise.  \\n       [0522] As already detailed further above, selective PDE4 inhibitors have a marked effect on the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells after those cells have been stimulated with a wide range of mediators, both in vitro and in vivo. The selective PDE4 inhibitor arofylline has been shown to provide beneficial effects when tested in models of colitis in the rat. Further, in a dextran sulfate induced colitis model in the rat, rolipram and the selective PDE4 inhibitor LAS31025 have demonstrated beneficial effects comparable to prednisolone. Both test compounds have been shown to ameliorate bleeding and inflammatory markers. See Puig et al. \u201cCurative effects of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors in dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis in the rat,\u201d  Gastroenterology  114(4) A1064, 1998. Other workers have used additional models to demonstrate the ability of selective PDE4 inhibitors to provide gastrointestinal protection. For example, it has been shown that lipopolysaccharide induced erythrocyte extravasation in rats and intestinal hypoperfusion in dogs can be attenuated with the selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and denbufylline. See Cardelus et al., \u201cInhibiting LPS induced bowel erythrocyte extravasation in rats, and of mesenteric hypoperfusion in dogs, by phosphodiesterase inhibitors,\u201d  Eur. J. Pharmacol.  299 153-159, 1996; and Cardelus et aL, \u201cProtective effects of denbufylline against endotoxin induced bowel hyperplasia,\u201d  Met. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol.  17(Suppl. A) 142, 1995.  \\n       [0523] 8.11 Septic Shock, Renal Failure, Cachexia, and Infection  \\n       [0524] Septic shock is shock associated with overwhelming infection, most commonly infection with gram negative-bacteria, although it may be produced by other bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Septic shock is deemed to result from the action of endotoxins or other products of the infectious agent on the vascular system, causing large volumes of blood to be sequestered in the capillaries and veins. Activation of the complement and kinin systems and the release of histamine, cytokines, prostaglandins, and other mediators is also involved.  \\n       [0525] It has been shown in a model of endotoxin-induced acute renal failure in rats that the selective PDE4 inhibitor, Ro-201724, given as a post-treatment at 10 \u03bcg/kg/min significantly increases urinary cAMP excretion, markedly attenuates endotoxin-induced increases in renal vascular resistance and decreases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Ro-201724 has also been shown to improve survival rates for endotoxin-treated rats. See Carcillo et al.,  Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.  279 1197, 1996. Pentoxifylline has also been studied in patients suffering from septic shock. In this study twenty-four individuals fulfilling the criteria for septic shock have been selected, twelve of which have received pentoxifylline at 1 mg/kg/hr over a 24-Hour period, while the other twelve have served as a control group. After 24 hours it has been found that the TNF-\u03b1 levels in the therapy group have been significantly lowered, while the IL-6 levels have been significantly increased.  \\n       [0526] In another study, it has been shown that pretreatment with pentoxifylline at 5 to 50 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, or with the selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram at 10 to 30 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, and debufylline at 0.1 to 3 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced bowel erythrocyte extravasation in rats, and that denbufylline is 100-fold more potent than pentoxifylline in inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced mesenteric blood flow fall, without affecting renal blood flow or cardiac index. See Cardelus et al., Ibid.,  Eur. J. Pharmacol.    \\n       [0527] Renal failure is the inability of the kidney to excrete metabolites at normal plasma levels under conditions of normal loading, or the inability to retain electrolytes under conditions of normal intake. In the acute form, it is marked by uremia and usually by oliguria or anuria, with hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema. On the basis of the above-described activities of selective PDE4 inhibitors, it has been demonstrated that selective PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of renal failure, especially acute renal failure. See Begany et al., \u201cInhibition of Type IV phosphodiesterase by Ro-20-1724 attenuates endotoxin-induced acute renal failure,\u201d  J. Pharmacol. Exp. Thera.  278 37-41, 1996. See also WO 98/00135 assigned to the University of Pittsburgh. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of renal failure, particularly acute renal failure.  \\n       [0528] Cachexia is a profound and marked state of constitutional disorder characterized by general ill health and malnutrition. Cachexia may be the end result of a number of causative factors, e.g., it may result from infection by any one of a number of different unicellular organisms or microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans. Malarial cachexia is representative and comprises a group of signs of a chronic nature that result from antecedent attacks of severe malaria, the principal signs being anemia, sallow skin, yellow sclera, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Another cause of cachexia is the deprivation or deterioration of humoral or other organic functions, e.g., hypophysial cachexia comprises a train of symptoms resulting from total deprivation of function of the pituitary gland, including phthisis, loss of sexual function, atrophy of the pituitary target glands, bradycardia, hypothermia, apathy, and coma. Uremic cachexia is cachexia associated with other systemic symptoms of advanced renal failure. Cardiac cachexia comprises the emaciation due to heart disease. Cachexia suprarenalis, or Addison&#39;s disease, is a disorder characterized by hypotension, weight loss, anorexia, and weakness, caused by adrenocortical hormone deficiency. It is due to tuberculosis- or autoimmune-induced destruction of the adrenal cortex that results in deficiency of aldosterone and cortisol.  \\n       [0529] Cachexia may also be the result of disease states of various types. Cancerous cachexia comprises the weak, emaciated condition seen in cases of malignant tumor. Cachexia can also be a consequence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and comprises the symptoms commonly referred to as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in treating cachexia of the different types described above as a result of their ability to provide down-regulation or inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release. The selective PDE4 inhibitors of the present invention have a marked effect on the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells after those cells have been stimulated with a wide range of mediators. TNF-\u03b1 release is implicated or plays a mediating role in diseases or conditions whose etiology involves or comprises morbid, i.e., unhealthy, excessive or unregulated TNF-\u03b1 release.  \\n       [0530] The PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of infection, especially infection by viruses wherein such viruses increase the production of TNF-\u03b1 in their host, or wherein such viruses are sensitive to upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 in their host so that their replication or other vital activities are adversely impacted. Such viruses include, e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-3; cytomegalovirus, CMV; influenza; adenoviruses; and Herpes viruses, especially Herpes zoster and Herpes simplex.  \\n       [0531] The PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of yeast and fungus infections wherein said yeast and fungi are sensitive to upregulation by TNF-\u03b1 or elicit TNF-\u03b1 production in their host. A particular disease which is treatable in this way is fungal meningitis. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also provide beneficial effects when combined with, i.e., administered in conjunction with other drugs of choice for the treatment of systemic yeast and fungus infections. Such drugs of choice include, but are not limited to polymixins, e.g., Polymycin B; imidazoles, e.g., clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole; triazoles, e.g., fluconazole and itranazole; and amphotericins, e.g., Amphotericin B and liposomal Amphotericin B. The term \u201cco-administration\u201d as used herein with reference to the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) and drugs of choice for the treatment of systemic yeast and fungus infections, is intended to mean and include (a) simultaneous administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated together into a single dosage form; (b) substantially simultaneous administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms; and (c) sequential administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated apart from each other and administered consecutively with some significant time interval between.  \\n       [0532] 8.12 Liver Injury  \\n       [0533] In addition to the above-described adverse effects of TNF-\u03b1, it also causes hepatic failure in humans, a phenomenon which has been shown in a number of animal models. For example, in an acute model of T-cell mediated hepatic failure, rolipram administered at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p. 30 minutes before challenge with either concanavalin A or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, has been shown to significantly reduce plasma TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3 concentrations, whereas it also significantly elevates IL-10 levels. See Gantner et al.,  J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.  280 53, 1997. In this same study, rolipram has also been shown to suppress concanavalin A-induced IL-4 release. The plasma activities of the liver specific enzymes ALT, AST, and SDH have also been assessed in this study, since any increase in their levels would indicate massive liver cell destruction. It has been found that in pretreatment of na\u00efve mice receiving concanavalin A, or galactosamine-sensitized mice receiving galactosaminelstaphylococcal enterotoxin B, with rolipram at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p., that rolipram has dose-dependently inhibited the above-mentioned plasma enzyme activities. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of T-cell disorders such as liver failure.  \\n       [0534] 8.13 Pulmonary Hypertension  \\n       [0535] It is known that the activity of phosphodiesterases, which hydrolyze the vasodilatory second messengers cAMP and cGMP, may be increased by hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Hypoxia is a reduction of oxygen supply to tissue below physiological levels despite adequate perfusion of the tissue by blood. The resulting pulmonary hypertension is characterized by increased pressure, i.e., above 30 mm Hg systolic and above 12 mm. Hg diastolic, within the pulmonary arterial circulation. Using a model which utilizes isolated pulmonary artery rings from normal rats and from rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, it has been shown that the selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram potentiates the relaxant activities of isoproterenol and forskolin. The same effect has been observed with milrinone, which is a selective PDE3 inhibitor, thereby supporting inhibition of both PDE3 and PDE4 in order to significantly improve pulmonary artery relaxation in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. See Wagner et al.,  J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.  282 1650, 1997. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, especially hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.  \\n       [0536] 8.14 Bone Loss Disease  \\n       [0537] Bone loss disease, more commonly referred to as osteoporosis, is a condition of low bone mass and microarchitectural disruption that results in fractures with minimal trauma. Secondary osteoporosis is due to systemic illness or medications such as glucocorticoids. Primary osteoporosis, it has been contended, should be viewed as comprising two conditions: Type I osteoporosis which is loss of trabecular bone due to estrogen deficiency at menopause, and Type II osteoporosis which is loss of cortical and trabecular bone due to long-term remodeling inefficiency, dietary inadequacy, and activation of the parathyroid axis with age. The primary regulators of adult bone mass include physical activity, reproductive endocrine status, and calcium intake, and optimal maintenance of bone requires sufficiency in all three areas.  \\n       [0538] It has been demonstrated that selective PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the beneficial treatment of bone loss disease, particularly osteoporosis. The effect of denbufylline on bone loss in Walker 256/S-bearing rats and on mineralized nodule formation and osteoclast-like cell formation has been studied in bone marrow culture systems. It has been discovered that serial oral administrations of denbufylline inhibit the decrease in the bone mineral density of femurs from Walker 256/S-bearing rats, and restore the bone mass and the number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts per trabecular surface in the femur metaphysis. The administration of denbufylline has also been found to result in an increase in the number of mineralized nodules and a decrease in the number of osteoclast-like cells in the in vitro bone marrow culture system. These beneficial effects are specific for PDE4 inhibition and are mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP, demonstrating that the PDE4 isozyme plays an important role in bone turnover through cAMP. See Miyamoto et al.,  Biochem. Pharmacol.  54 613, 1997; Waki et al., \u201cEffects of XT-44, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in osteoblastgenesis and osteoclastgenesis in culture and its therapeutic effects in rat osteopenia models,\u201d  Jpn. J. Pharmacol  79 477-483,.1999; and JP 9169665 assigned to Miyamoto (1997) Consequently, the selective PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of diseases involving bone loss, especially osteoporosis.  \\n       [0539] 8.15 CNS Disorders  \\n       [0540] The PDE4 selective inhibitor rolipram was initially developed as an antidepressant and continues to be studied in clinical trials for that indication. Further, it has been demonstrated that selective PDE4 inhibitors provide beneficial effects in other central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson&#39;s disease, Hulley et al., \u201cInhibitors of Type IV phosphodiesterases reduce the toxicity of MPTP in substantia nigra neurons in vivo,\u201d  Eur. J. Neurosci.  7 2431-2440, 1995; as well as learning and memory impairment, Egawa et al., \u201cRolipram and its optical isomers, phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, attenuate the scopolamine-induced impairments of learning and memory in rats,\u201d  Jpn.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA  95 15020-15025, 1998.  \\n       [0541] The use of PDE4 inhibitors to treat tardive dyskinesia and drug dependence has also been disclosed in the art, WO 95/28177 and JP 92221423 (1997), both assigned to Meiji . Seika Kaisha Ltd. The PDE4 isozyme has been found to play a major role in controlling dopamine biosynthesis in mesencephalic neurons; accordingly PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of disorders and diseases which are associated with or mediated by dopamine within and around mesencephalic neurons, Yamashita et a., \u201cRolipram, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase Type 4, pronouncedly enhances the forskolin-induced promotion of dopamine biosynthesis in primary cultured rat mesencephalic neurons,\u201d  Jpn. J. Pharmacol.  75 91-95, 1997.  \\n       [0542] The PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of arteriosclerotic dementia and subcortical dementia. Arteriosclerotic dementia, also called vascular dementia and multi-infarct dementia, is a dementia with a stepwise deteriorating course in the form of a series of small strokes, and an irregular distribution of neurological deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease. Subcortical dementia are caused by lesions affecting subcortical brain structures and are characterized by memory loss with slowness in processing information or making intellectual responses. Included are dementias that accompany Huntington&#39;s chorea, Wilson&#39;s disease, paralysis agitans, and thalamic atrophies.  \\n       [0543] 8.16 Other Therapeutic Applications  \\n       [0544] It has been demonstrated that PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury, Block et al., \u201cDelayed treatment with rolipram protects against neuronal damage following global ischemia in rats,\u201d  NeuroReport  8 3829-3832, 1997 and Belayev et al. \u201cProtection against blood-brain barrier disruption in focal cerebral ischemia by the Type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor BBB022: a quantitative study,\u201d  Brain Res.  787 277-285, 1998; in the treatment of autoimmune diabetes, Liang et al., \u201cThe phosphodiesterase inhibitors pentoxifylline and rolipram prevent diabetes in NOD mice,\u201d  Diabetes  47 570-575, 1998; in the treatment of retinal autoimmunity, Xu et al., \u201cProtective effect of the Type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram in EAU: protection is independent of the IL-10-inducing activity,\u201d  Invest Ophthalmol.

The second, etc. therapeutic agent may also be one or more compounds of Formula (1.0.0), or one or more PDE4 inhibitors known in the art and described in detail herein. More typically, the second, etc. therapeutic agent will be selected from a different class of therapeutic agents. These selections are described in detail below.  \\n       [0575] As used herein, the terms \u201cco-administration\u201d, \u201cco-administered\u201d, and \u201cin combination with\u201d, referring to the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) and one or more other therapeutic agents, is intended to mean, and does refer to and include the following: (a) simultaneous administration of such combination of compound(s) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated together into a single dosage form which releases said components at substantially the same time to said patient; (b) substantially simultaneous administration of such combination of compound(s) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are ingested at substantially the same time by said patient, whereupon said components are released at substantially the same time to said patient; (c) sequential administration of such combination of compound(s) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are ingested at consecutive times by said patient with a significant time interval between each ingestion, whereupon said components are released at substantially different times to said patient; and (d) sequential administration of such combination of compound(s) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated together into a single dosage form which releases said components in a controlled manner whereupon they are concurrently, consecutively, and/or overlappingly ingested at the same and/or different times by said patient.  \\n       [0576] 9.1 With Leukotriene Biosynthesis Inhibitors: 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) Inhibitors and 5-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) Antagonists  \\n       [0577] One or more compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is used in combination with leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, i.e., 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and/or 5-lipoxygenase activating protein antagonists, to form embodiments of the present invention. As already adverted to above, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is one of two groups of enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid, the other group being the cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2. The 5-lipoxygenase activating protein is an 18 kDa membrane-bound, arachidonate-binding protein which stimulates the conversion of cellular arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. The arachidonic acid is converted into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), and this pathway eventually leads to the production of inflammatory leukotrienes; consequently, blocking the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein or the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme itself provides a desirable target for beneficially interfering with that pathway. One such 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor is zileuton represented by Formula (0.1.14), which may be found both above and following. Among the classes of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors which are useful for forming therapeutic combinations with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are the following:  \\n       [0578] (a) redox-active agents which include N-hydroxyureas; N-alkylhydroxamic acids; selenite; hydroxybenzofurans; hydroxylamines; and catechols; see Ford-Hutchinson et al., \u201c5-Lipoxygenase,\u201d  Ann.

Med. Chem.  40 1955-68, 1997;  \\n       [0579] (b) alkylating agents and compounds which react with SH groups have been found to inhibit leukotriene synthesis in vitro; see Larsson et al., \u201cEffects of 1-chloro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene on 5-lipoxygenase activity and cellular leukotriene synthesis,\u201d  Biochem. Pharmacol.  55 863-71, 1998; and  \\n       [0580] (c) competitive inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, based on thiopyranoindole and methoxyalkyl thiazole structures which may act as non-redox inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase; see Ford-Hutchinson et al., Ibid.; and Hamel et al., \u201cSubstituted (pyridylmethoxy)naphthalenes as potent and orally active 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors-synthesis, biological profile, and pharmacokinetics of L-739,010 ,\u201d J. Med. Chem.  40 2866-75, 1997.  \\n       [0581] The observation that arachidonoyl hydroxyamate inhibits 5-lipoxygenase has led to the discovery of clinically useful selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors such as the N-hydroxyurea derivatives zileuton and ABT-761, represented by Formulas (0.1.14) and (5.2.1):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0582] Another N-hydroxyurea compound is fenleuton (Abbott-76745) which is represented by Formula (5.2.2):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0583] Zileuton is covered by U.S. Pat.

See Connolly et al., \u201cN-Hydroxyurea and hydroxamic acid inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase,\u201d  Bioorganic  &amp;  Medicinal Chemistry Letters  9 979-984, 1999.  \\n       [0590] Another N-hydroxyurea compound is Abbott-79175 which is represented by Formula (5.2.6):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0591] Abbott-79175 has a longer duration of action than zileuton; Brooks et al.,  J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut.  272 724, 1995.  \\n       [0592] A still further N-hydroxyurea compound is Abbott-85761 which is represented by Formula (5.2.7):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0593] Abbott-85761 is delivered to the lung by aerosol administration of a homogeneous, physically stable and nearly monodispersed formulation; Gupta et aL, \u201cPulmonary delivery of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, Abbott-85761, in beagle dogs,\u201d  International Journal of Pharmaceutics  147 207-218, 1997.  \\n       [0594] Fenleuton, Abbott-79175, Abbott-85761 or any of the above-described derivatives thereof or of tepoxalin, are combined with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to form embodiments of the present invention.  \\n       [0595] Since the elucidation of the 5-LO biosynthetic pathway, there has been an ongoing debate as to whether it is more advantageous to inhibit the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme or to antagonize peptido- or non-peptido leukotriene receptors. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase are deemed to be superior to LT-receptor antagonists, since 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors block the action of the full spectrum of 5-LO products, whereas LT-antagonists produce narrower effects. Nevertheless, embodiments of the present invention include combinations of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) with LT-antagonists as well as 5-LO inhibitors, as described below. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase having chemical structures that differ from the classes of N-hydroxyureas and hydroxamic acids described above are also used in combination with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to form further embodiments of the present invention. An example of such a different class is the N-(5-substituted)-thiophene-2-alkylsulfonamides of Formula (5.2.8):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0596] where X is O or S; R\u2032 is methyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, n-octyl, or phenyl; and R is n-pentyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, tetrahydro-1-naphthyl, 1- or 2-naphthyl, or phenyl mono- or di-substituted by Cl, F, Br, CH 3 , OCH 3 , SCH 3 , SO 2 CH 3 , CF 3 , or iso-propyl. A preferred compound is that of Formula (5.2.9):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0597] A further description of these compounds may be found in Beers et al., \u201cN-(5-substituted) thiophene-2-alkylsulfonamides as potent inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase,\u201d  Bioorganic  &amp;  Medicinal Chemistry  5(4) 779-786, 1997.  \\n       [0598] Another distinct class of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors is that of the 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol hydrazones described in Cuadro et al., \u201cSynthesis and biological evaluation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol hydrazones as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors,\u201d  Bioorganic  &amp;  Medicinal Chemistry  6 173-180, 1998.

ZD-2138 is represented by Formula (5.2.11):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0602] ZD-2138 is highly selective and highly active orally in a number of species and has been evaluated in the treatment of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis by oral admininstration. Further details concerning ZD-2138 and derivatives thereof are disclosed in Crawley et al.,  J. Med. Chem.,  35 2600, 1992; and Crawley et al.,  J. Med. Chem.  36 295, 1993.  \\n       [0603] Another distinct class of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors is that to which the SmithKline Beecham compound SB-210661 belongs. SB-210661 is represented by Formula (5.2.12):  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0604] Two further distinct and related classes of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors comprise a series of pyridinyl-substituted 2-cyanonaphthalene compounds and a series of 2-cyanoquinoline compounds discovered by Merck Frosst. These two classes of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are exemplified by L-739,010 and L-746,530, represented by Formulas (5.2.13) and (5.2.14) respectively:  \\n                 \\n \\n       [0605] Details concerning L-739,010 and L-746,530 are disclosed in Dube et aL, \u201cQuinolines as potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors: synthesis and biological profile of L-746,530 ,\u201d Bioorganic  &amp;  Medicinal Chemistry  8 1255-1260, 1998; and in WO 95/03309 (Friesen et al.).  \\n       [0606] The class of methoxytetrahydropyrans including Zeneca ZD-2138 of Formula (5.2.11); or the lead compound SB-210661 of Formula (5.2.12) and the class to which it belongs; or the series of pyridinyl-substituted 2-cyanonaphthalene compounds to which L-739,010 belongs, or the series of 2-cyanoquinoline compounds to which L-746,530 belongs; or any of the above-described derivatives of any of the above-mentioned classes, are combined with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to form embodiments of the present invention.  \\n       [0607] In addition to the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme, the other endogenous agent which plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of the leukotrienes is the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP). This role is an indirect one, in contrast to the direct role of the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. Nevertheless, antagonists of the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein are employed to inhibit the cellular synthesis of leukotrienes, and as such are also used in combination with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to form embodiments of the present invention.  \\n       [0608] Compounds which bind to the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein and thereby block utilization of the endogenous pool of archidonic acid which is present have been synthesized from indole and quinoline structures; see Ford-Hutchinson et al., Ibid.; Rouzer et a!. \u201cMK-886, a potent and specific leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor blocks and reverses the membrane association of 5-lipoxygenase in ionophore-challenged leukocytes,\u201d  J.

It should be understood, however, that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredient may also depend upon the therapeutic or prophylactic agent, if any, with which the ingredient is co-administered.  \\n       [0674] The above-described compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of acids, esters, or other chemical classes of compounds to which the compounds described belong. It is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize those compounds in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases in accordance with procedures described in detail above and well known in the art. An active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0) is often utilized in the form of a salt thereof, especially where said salt form confers on said active ingredient improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to the free form of said active ingredient or some other salt form of said active ingredient utilized previously. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of said active ingredient may also initially confer a desirable pharmacokinetic property on said active ingredient which it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of said active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body.  \\n       [0675] The pharmacokinetic properties of said active ingredient which may be favorably affected include, e.g., the manner in which said active ingredient is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of said active ingredient. While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important, and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of said active ingredient is usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof which it utilized. Further, as the artisan understands, an aqueous solution of said active ingredient will provide the most rapid absorption of said active ingredient into the body of a patient being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid dosage forms, will result in less rapid absorption of said active ingredient. Oral ingestion of said active ingredient is the most preferred route of administration for reasons of safety, convenience, and economy, but absorption of such an oral dosage form can be adversely affected by physical characteristics such as polarity, emesis caused by irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, destruction by digestive enzymes and low pH, irregular absorption or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and metabolism by enzymes of the mucosa, the intestinal flora, or the liver. Formulation of said active ingredient into different pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms may be effective in overcoming or alleviating one or more of the above-recited problems encountered with absorption of oral dosage forms.  \\n       [0676] Among the pharmaceutical salts recited further above, those which are preferred include, but are not limited to acetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisuccinate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, meglumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stearate, sulfate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate, and tromethamine.  \\n       [0677] Multiple salts forms are included within the scope of the present invention where a compound of the present invention contains more than one group capable of forming such pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Where the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are simple aqueous and/or other solvent solutions, the various components of the overall composition are brought together in any practical order, which will be dictated largely by considerations of convenience. Those components having reduced water solubility, but sufficient solubility in the same co-solvent with water, may all be dissolved in said co-solvent, after which the co-solvent solution will be added to the water portion of the carrier whereupon the solutes therein will become dissolved in the water. To aid in this dispersion/solution process, a surfactant may be employed.  \\n       [0702] Where the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are to be in the form of emulsions, the components of the pharmaceutical composition will be brought together in accordance with the following general procedures. The continuous water phase is first heated to a temperature in the range of from about 60\u00b0 to about 95\u00b0 C., preferably from about 700 to about 85\u00b0 C., the choice of which temperature to use being dependent upon the physical and chemical properties of the components which make up the oil-in-water emulsion. Once the continuous water phase has reached its selected temperature, the components of the final composition to be added at this stage are admixed with the water and dispersed therein under high-speed agitation. Next, the temperature of the water is restored to approximately its original level, after which the components of the composition which comprise the next stage are added to the composition mixture under moderate agitation and mixing continues for from about 5 to about 60 minutes, preferably about 10 to about 30 minutes, depending on the components of the first two stages. Thereafter, the composition mixture is passively or actively cooled to from about 200 to about 55\u00b0 C. for addition of any components in the remaining stages, after which water is added in sufficient quantity to reach its original predetermined concentration in the overall composition.  \\n       [0703] According to the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer&#39;s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as do natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as Rh, HCIX or similar alcohol.  \\n       [0704] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.  \\n       [0705] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.  \\n       [0706] Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation, as described above, or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically active transdermal patches may also be used.  \\n       [0707] For topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate , cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.  \\n       [0708] Pharmaceutical compositions within the scope of the present invention include those wherein the therapeutically effective amount of an active ingredient comprising a compound of the present invention required for treating or preventing diseases, disorders, and conditions mediated by or associated with modulation of PDE4, especially PDE4D activity as described herein, is provided in a dosage form suitable for systemic administration.

or (4) ingestion of said pharmaceutical composition in suitable solid or liquid form for peroral delivery of said active ingredient, where said active ingredient is contained in a solid dosage form; or (b) is contained in a liquid dosage form.  \\n       [0709] Particular dosage forms of the above-described pharmaceutical compositions include (1) suppositories as a special type of implant, comprising bases which are solid at room temperature but melt at body temperature, slowly releasing the active ingredient with which they are impregnated into the surrounding tissue of the body, where the active ingredient becomes absorbed and transported to effect systemic administration; (2) solid peroral dosage forms selected from the group consisting of (a) delayed-release oral tablets, capsules, caplets, lozenges, troches, and multiparticulates; (b) enteric-coated tablets and capsules which prevent release and absorption in the stomach to facilitate delivery distal to the stomach of the patient being treated;

For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspension in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.  \\n       [0711] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation through the use of a nebulizer, a dry powder inhaler or a metered dose inhaler. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, hydrofluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.  \\n       [0712] As already mentioned, the active ingredients of Formula (1.0.0) of the present invention may be administered systemically to a patient to be treated as a pharmaceutical composition in suitable liquid form by injection or infusion. There are a number of sites and organ systems in the body of the patient which will allow the properly formulated pharmaceutical composition, once injected or infused, to permeate the entire body and all of the organ system of the patient being treated. An injection is a single dose of the pharmaceutical composition forced, usually by a syringe, into the tissue involved. The most common types of injections are intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous. By contrast, an infusion is the gradual introduction of the pharmaceutical composition into the tissue involved. The most common type of infusion is intravenous. Other types of injection or infusion comprise intraarterial, intra- or transdermal (including subcutaneous), or intraspinal especially intrathecal. In these liquid pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient may be contained in solution as the solute. This is the most common and most preferred type of such composition, but requires an active ingredient in a salt form that has reasonably good aqueous solubility. Water (or saline) is by far the most preferred solvent for such compositions. Occasionally supersaturated solutions may be utilized, but these present stability problems that make them impractical for use on an everyday basis.  \\n       [0713] If it is not possible to obtain a form of some compound of Formula (1.0.0) that has the requisite degree of aqueous solubility, as may sometimes occur, it is within the skill of the artisan to prepare an emulsion, which is a dispersion of small globules of one liquid, the discontinuous or internal phase, throughout a second liquid, the continuous or external phase, with which it is immiscible. The two liquids are maintained in an emulsified state by the use of emulsifiers which are pharmaceutically acceptable. Thus, if the active ingredient is a water-insoluble oil, it can be administered in an emulsion of which it is the discontinuous phase. Also where the active ingredient is water-insoluble but can be dissolved in a solvent which is immiscible with water, an emulsion can be used. While the active ingredient would most commonly be used as the discontinuous or internal phase of what is referred to as an oil-in-water emulsion, it could also be used as the discontinuous or internal phase of an inverse emulsion, which is commonly referred to as a water-in-oil emulsion. Here the active ingredient is soluble in water and could be administered as a simple aqueous solution. However, inverse emulsions invert upon injection or infusion into an aqueous medium such as the blood, and offer the advantage of providing a more rapid and efficient dispersion of the active ingredient into that aqueous medium than can be obtained using an aqueous solution. Inverse emulsions are prepared by using suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agents well known in the art. Where the active ingredient has limited water solubility, it may also be administered as a suspended solid in colloidal or microparticulate form in a suspension prepared using suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents. The suspended solids containing the active ingredient may also be formulated as delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release compositions.  \\n       [0714] While systemic administration will most frequently be carried out by injection or infusion of a liquid, there are many situations in which it will be advantageous or even necessary to deliver the active ingredient as a solid. Systemic administration of solids is carried out by instillation, inhalation or insufflation of a pharmaceutical composition in suitable solid form containing the active ingredient. Instillation of the active ingredient may entail installing a solid implant composition into suitable body tissues or cavities. The implant may comprise a matrix of bio-compatible and bio-erodible materials in which particles of a solid active ingredient are dispersed, or in which, possibly, globules or isolated cells of a liquid active ingredient are entrapped. Desirably, the matrix will be broken down and completely absorbed by the body. The composition of the matrix is also preferably selected to provide controlled-, sustained-, and/or delayed release of the active ingredient over extended periods of time, even as much as several months.  \\n       [0715] The term \u201cimplant\u201d most often denotes a solid pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient, while the term \u201cdepot\u201d usually implies a liquid pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient, which is deposited in any suitable body tissues or cavities to form a reservoir or pool which slowly migrates to surrounding tissues and organs and eventually becomes systemically distributed. However, these distinctions are not always rigidly adhered to in the art, and consequently, it is contemplated that there is included within the scope of the present invention liquid implants and solid depots, and even mixed solid and liquid forms for each. Suppositories may be regarded as a type of implant, since they comprise bases which are solid at room temperature but melt at a patient&#39;s body temperature, slowly releasing the active ingredient with which they are impregnated into the surrounding tissue of the patient&#39;s body, where the active ingredient becomes absorbed and transported to effect systemic administration.  \\n       [0716] Systemic administration can also be accomplished by inhalation or insufflation of a powder, i.e., particulate composition containing the active ingredient. For example, the active ingredient in powder form may be inhaled into the lungs using conventional devices for aerosolizing particulate formulations. The active ingredient as a particulate formulation may also be administered by insufflation, i.e., blown or otherwise dispersed into suitable body tissues or cavities by simple dusting or using conventional devices for aerosolizing particulate formulations. These particulate compositions may also be formulated to provide delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release of the active ingredient in accordance with well understood principles and known materials.  \\n       [0717] Other means of systemic administration which may utilize the active ingredients of the present invention in either liquid or solid form include transdermal, intranasal, and opthalmic routes. In particular, transdermal patches prepared in accordance with well known drug delivery technology may be prepared and applied to the skin of a patient to be treated, whereafter the active agent by reason of its formulated solubility characteristics migrates across the epidermis and into the dermal layers of the patient&#39;s skin where it is taken up as part of the general circulation of the patient, ultimately providing systemic distribution of the active ingredient over a desired, extended period of time. Also included are implants which are placed beneath the epidermal layer of the skin, i.e. between the epidermis and the dermis of the skin of the patient being treated. Such an implant will be formulated in accordance with well known principles and materials commonly used in this delivery technology, and may be prepared in such a way as to provide controlled-, sustained-, and/or delayed-release of the active ingredient into the systemic circulation of the patient. Such subepidermal (subcuticular) implants provide the same facility of installation and delivery efficiency as transdermal patches, but without the limitation of being subject to degradation, damage or accidental removal as a consequence of being exposed on the top layer of the patient&#39;s skin.  \\n       [0718] In the above description of pharmaceutical compositions containing an active ingredient of Formula (1.0.0), the equivalent expressions: \u201cadministration\u201d, \u201cadministration of\u201d, \u201cadministering\u201d, and \u201cadministering a\u201d have been used with respect to said pharmaceutical compositions. As thus employed, these expressions are intended to mean providing to a patient in need of treatment a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention by any of the routes of administration herein described, wherein the active ingredient is a compound of Formula (1.0.0) or a prodrug, derivative, or metabolite thereof which is useful in treating a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by or associated with modulation of PDE4, especially PDE4D activity in said patient. Accordingly, there is included within the scope of the present invention any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of directly or indirectly providing a compound of Formula (1.0.0). Such compounds are recognized as prodrugs, and a number of established procedures are available for preparing such prodrug forms of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0).  \\n       [0719] The dosage and dose rate of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) effective for treating or preventing a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by or associated with modulation of PDE4, especially PDE4D activity, will depend on a variety of factors, such as the nature of the inhibitor, the size of the patient, the goal of the treatment, the nature of the pathology to be treated, the specific pharmaceutical composition used, and the observations and conclusions of the treating physician.  \\n       [0720] For example, where the dosage form is oral, e.g., a tablet or capsule, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 0.1 \u03bcg/kg and about 50.0 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 5.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 5.0 mg/kg body weight per day, more preferably between about 10.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 1.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 20.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day of the active ingredient.  \\n       [0721] Where the dosage form is topically administered to the bronchia and lungs, e.g., by means of a powder inhaler or nebulizer, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 0.001 \u03bcg/kg and about 10.0 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day, more preferably between about 1.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 2.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.05 mg/kg of body weight per day of the active ingredient.  \\n       [0722] Using representative body weights of 10 kg and 100 kg in order to illustrate the range of daily aerosolized topical dosages which might be used as described above, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 1.0-10.0 kg and 500.0-5000.0 mg per day, preferably between about 5.0-50.0 \u03bcg and 5.0-50.0 mg per day, more preferably between about 100.0-1000.0 \u03bcg and 10.0-100.0 mg per day, and most preferably between about 200.0-2000.0 \u03bcg and about 5.0-50.0 mg per day of the active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0). These ranges of dosage amounts represent total dosage amounts of the active ingredient per day for a given patient. The number of times per day that a dose is administered will depend upon such pharmacological and pharmacokinetic factors as the half-life of the active ingredient, which reflects its rate of catabolism and clearance, as well as the minimal and optimal blood plasma or other body fluid levels of said active ingredient attained in the patient which are required for therapeutic efficacy.  \\n       [0723] Numerous other factors must also be considered in deciding upon the number of doses per day and the amount of active ingredient per dose that will be administered. Not the least important of such other factors is the individual respsonse of the patient being treated. Thus, for example, where the active ingredient is used to treat or prevent asthma, and is administered topically via aerosol inhalation into the lungs, from one to four doses consisting of acuations of a dispensing device, i.e., \u201cpuffs\u201d of an inhaler, will be administered each day, each dose containing from about 50.0 \u03bcg to about 10.0 mg of active ingredient.  \\n       DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0724] 11.0 Preparations and Working Examples  \\n       [0725] There follows a description of numerous Preparations by which intermediates used in preparing specific compounds of Formula (1.0.0) were made.

The enzymes within each family are commonly referred to as isoenzymes, or isozymes. A total of more than fifteen gene products is included within this class, and further diversity results from differential splicing and post-translational processing of those gene products. The present invention is primarily concerned with the four gene products of the fourth family of PDEs, i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. These enzymes are collectively referred to as being isoforms or subtypes of the PDE4 isozyme family. Further below will be found a more detailed discussion of the genomic organization, molecular structure and enzymatic activity, differential splicing, transcriptional regulation and phosphorylation, distribution and expression, and selective inhibition of the PDE4 isozyme subtypes. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] The PDE4s are characterized by selective, high affinity hydrolytic degradation of the second messenger cyclic nucleotide, adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and by sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. A number of selective inhibitors of the PDE4s have been discovered in recent years, and beneficial pharmacological effects resulting from that inhibition have been shown in a variety of disease models. See, e.g., Torphy et al., <i>Environ. Health Perspect. </i>102 Suppl. 10, 79-84, 1994; Duplantier et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>39 120-125, 1996; Schneider et al., <i>Pharmacol. Biochem.

Accordingly, there continues to be considerable interest in the art with regard to the discovery of further selective inhibitors of PDE4s. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] The present invention is also concerned with the use of selective PDE4 inhibitors for the improved therapeutic treatment of a number of inflammatory, respiratory and allergic diseases and conditions, but especially for the treatment of asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and bronchiectasis; chronic rhinitis; and chronic sinusitis. Heretofore in the art, however, the first-line therapy for treatment of asthma and other obstructive airway diseases has been the nonselective PDE inhibitor theophylline, as well as pentoxifylline and IBMX, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.1), (0.0.2), and (0.0.3), respectively:  \\n<chemistry id=\"CHEM-US-00004\" num=\"4\"> <img file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00004.TIF\" id=\"EMI-C00004\" he=\"295.71885\" wi=\"194.4243\" img-format=\"tif\" img-content=\"ui\"/> <attachments> <attachment idref=\"CHEMCDX-00004\" attachment-type=\"cdx\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00004.CDX\"> </attachment> <attachment idref=\"CHEMMOL-00004\" attachment-type=\"mol\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00004.MOL\"> </attachment> </attachments> </chemistry>\\n</p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] Theophylline, which has the PDEs as one of its biochemical targets, in addition to its well characterized bronchodilatory activity, affects the vasculature of patients with increased pulmonary artery pressure, suppresses inflammatory cell responses, and induces apoptosis of eosinophils. Theophylline&#39;s adverse events, most commonly cardiac dysrhythmias and nausea, are also mediated by PDE inhibition, however, leading to the search for more selective inhibitors of PDEs that are able to suppress both immune cell functions in vitro and allergic pulmonary inflammation in vivo, while at the same time having improved side-effect profiles. Within the airways of patients suffering from asthma and other obstructive airway diseases, PDE4 is the most important of the PDE isozymes as a target for drug discovery because of its distribution in airway smooth muscle and inflammatory cells. Several PDE4 inhibitors introduced to the art thus far have been designed to have an improved therapeutic index concerning the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system side effects of the above-mentioned nonselective xanthines. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008] Airflow obstruction and airway inflammation are features of asthma as well as COPD. While bronchial asthma is predominantly characterized by an eosinophilic inflammation, neutrophils appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Thus, PDEs that are involved in smooth muscle relaxation and are also found in eosinophils as well as neutrophils probably constitute an essential element of the progress of both diseases. The PDEs involved include PDE3s as well as PDE4s, and bronchodilating inhibitors have been discovered which are selective PDE3 inhibitors and dual PDE3/4 selective inhibitors. Examples of these are milrinone, a selective PDE3 inhibitor, as well as zardaverine and benafentrine, both dual PDE3/4 selective inhibitors, which may be represented by Formulas (0.0.4), (0.0.5), and (0.0.6), respectively:  \\n<chemistry id=\"CHEM-US-00005\" num=\"5\"> <img file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00005.TIF\" id=\"EMI-C00005\" he=\"301.72905\" wi=\"207.38025\" img-format=\"tif\" img-content=\"ui\"/> <attachments> <attachment idref=\"CHEMCDX-00005\" attachment-type=\"cdx\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00005.CDX\"> </attachment> <attachment idref=\"CHEMMOL-00005\" attachment-type=\"mol\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00005.MOL\"> </attachment> </attachments> </chemistry>\\n</p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] However, benafentrine results in bronchodilation only when administered by inhalation, and zardaverine produces only a modest and short-lived bronchodilation.

PDE4 inhibitors also suppress the activity of a number of inflammatory cells associated with the pathophysiology of COPD, including monocytes/macrophages, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils. PDE4 inhibitors also reduce vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis and, and potentially interfere with the ability of airway epithelial cells to generate pro-inflammatory mediators. Through the release of neutral proteases and acid hydrolases from their granules, and the generation of reactive oxygen species, neutrophils contribute to the tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammation, and are further implicated in the pathology of conditions such as emphysema. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0012\" num=\"0012\">[0012] Selective PDE4 inhibitors which have been discovered thus far that provide therapeutic advantages include SB-207,499, identified as ARIFLO\u00ae, which may be represented by Formula (0.1.9):  \\n<chemistry id=\"CHEM-US-00007\" num=\"7\"> <img file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00007.TIF\" id=\"EMI-C00007\" he=\"73.9368\" wi=\"185.77755\" img-format=\"tif\" img-content=\"ui\"/> <attachments> <attachment idref=\"CHEMCDX-00007\" attachment-type=\"cdx\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00007.CDX\"> </attachment> <attachment idref=\"CHEMMOL-00007\" attachment-type=\"mol\" file=\"US20020123520A1-20020905-C00007.MOL\"> </attachment> </attachments> </chemistry>\\n</p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0013\" num=\"0013\">[0013] SB-207,499, administered orally at dosages of 5, 10, and 15 mg b.i.d., has produced significant increases in trough FEV, (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) from placebo at week 2 of a study involving a large number of patients.

These definintions are intended to mean first, a carbon ring system having two or more rings, especially bicyclic and tricyclic, more especially bicyclic, in which the rings are fused, i.e., there is at least one pair of bridgehead carbon atoms present. These polycyclic ring systems may be saturated or unsaturated. Second, the above-quoted definition is also intended to mean a carbon ring system having two or more rings in which said rings are discontinuous, i.e., they are attached to each other by a single or double covalent bond and there are no bridgehead carbon atoms present. These polycyclic ring systems may also be saturated or unsaturated. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0237\" num=\"0237\">[0237] Respecting the situation where a carbon ring system has been selected that is discontinuous, as opposed to one that is fused, it should be noted that the moiety G<sup>1 </sup>is not permitted to be such a discontinuous carbon ring system. The moiety G<sup>2 </sup>on the other hand, is required to be discontinuous in this situation. It is further provided herein that the moiety G<sup>2 </sup>may have the meaning of a carbon ring system that is discontinuous, or it may have the meaning of a \u201crestricted biaryl\u201d carbon ring system. These two aspects have been brought together under the expression \u201cdiscontinuous or restricted biaryl\u201d, which as used herein is intended to mean a discontinuous ring system or a fused polycyclic ring system as defined immediately above in which (1) bridgehead carbon atoms are joined by a bond, i.e., there are no additional carbon atoms present between said bridgehead carbon atoms; and (2) heteroatoms, if present, are contained only in a tricyclic or higher polycyclic fused ring system. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0238\" num=\"0238\">[0238] Further, however, it should be noted that the moiety G<sup>2 </sup>may have the meaning of a carbon ring system as defined above that is neither discontinuous nor a restricted biaryl. Thus, G<sup>2 </sup>may be a saturated or unsaturated mono- or polycyclic optionally containing heteroatoms as described above. Accordingly, the moiety G<sup>2 </sup>has the meaning, e.g., of phenyl, cyclohexyl, or pyridyl. The moiety G<sup>1 </sup>also has this meaning. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0239\" num=\"0239\">[0239] The types of restricted biaryl and discontinuous ring systems that may comprise a meaning of G<sup>2</sup>, but that may not comprise a meaning of G<sup>1 </sup>include, inter alia, the following, where the numbers after the names refer to the partial Formulas therefor recited elsewhere herein: biphenyl (1.2.1); 3-phenyl-pyridine (1.2.2); cyclohexyl-benzene (1.2.3); [2,2\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.4); bicyclohexyl (1.2.5); 2-phenyl-thiophene (1.2.6); 2-phenyl-furan (1.2.7); naphthalene (1.2.8); diphenylmethane (1.2.9); 4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (1.2.10); 3-benzyl-pyridine (1.2.11); 4,5-diphenyl-oxazole (1.2.12); fluorene (1.2.13); 9H-carbazole (1.2.14); phenyl ether (1.2.15); 1H-indole (1.2.16); quinoline (1.2.17); phenanthrene (1.2.18); phenanthridine (1.2.19); [3,3\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.20); [4,4\u2032]bipyridinyl (1.2.21); 2-cyclohexyl-pyridine (1.2.22); biphenylene (1.2.23); 3-benzhydryl-pyridine (1.2.24); 2-phenyl-thiazole (1.2.25); 2-phenyl-oxazole (1.2.26); 5-phenyl-pyrimidine (1.2.27); 1 OH-phenothiazine (1.2.28); 2-phenyl-benzooxazole (1.2.29); 2-phenyl-benzothiazole (1.2.30); 2-phenyl-1 H-benzoimidazole (1.2.31); and 10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1.2.32). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0240\" num=\"0240\">[0240] As a further illustration, it will be understood that, e.g., a naphthyl moiety is a restricted biaryl moiety as defined herein, since it is a fused bicyclic with a bond between the bridgehead carbon atoms, and there are no heteroatoms present. A quinolinyl moiety, on the other hand, while also a fused bicyclic with a bond between the bridgehead carbon atoms, is not a restricted biaryl moiety as defined herein, since a nitrogen heteroatom is also present, and the definition of restricted biaryl as used herein requires that the fused ring system be tricyclic or higher polycyclic where a heteroatom is present. The biphenyl moiety is an example of a discontinuous ring system that, accordingly, may be a meaning of G<sup>2 </sup>but may not be a meaning of G<sup>1</sup>. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0241\" num=\"0241\">[0241] As used herein, the expression \u201csaturated or unsaturated carbon ring system that is 7- to 12-membered, fused or discontinuous, polycyclic\u201d is intended to include such saturated fused bi- and tricyclic carbon ring systems as norbornane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octanyl, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanyl, bicyclo[3.3.0]octanyl, bicyclo[3.3.1]nonanyl, cyclodecanyl, and adamantanyl.

</heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0394\" num=\"0394\">[0394] 7.0 Pharmaceutical Salts and Other Forms </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0395\" num=\"0395\">[0395] The above-described compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of acids, esters, or other chemical classes of compounds to which the compounds described belong. It is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize those compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases in accordance with procedures well known in the art. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0396\" num=\"0396\">[0396] Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are prepared for the most part by conventional means. Where the compound of Formula (1.0.0) contains a carboxylic acid group, a suitable salt thereof may be formed by reacting the compound with an appropriate base to provide the corresponding base addition salt. Examples of such bases are alkali metal hydroxides including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, e.g., potassium ethanolate and sodium propanolate; and various organic bases such as piperidine, diethanolamine, and N-methylglutamine. Also included are the aluminum salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0397\" num=\"0397\">[0397] For certain compounds of Formula (1.0.0) acid addition salts may be formed by treating said compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids, e.g., hydrohalides such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide; other mineral acids and their corresponding salts such as sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, etc.; and alkyl- and mono-arylsulfonates such as ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, and benzenesulfonate; and other organic acids and their corresponding salts such as acetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascorbate, etc. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0398\" num=\"0398\">[0398] Accordingly, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) include, but are not limited to: acetate, adipate, alginate, arginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, caprylate, chloride, chlorobenzoate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, galacterate (from mucic acid), galacturonate, glucoheptanoate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, hemisuccinate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-Hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isethionate, iso-butyrate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogenphosphate, 2-Naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, oleate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, phenylacetate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, phosphonate, phthalate. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0399\" num=\"0399\">[0399] Further, base salts of the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts. Preferred among the above-recited salts are ammonium; the alkali metal salts sodium and potassium; and the alkaline earth metal salts calcium and magnesium. Salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include, but are not limited to salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, e.g., arginine, betaine, caffeine, chloroprocaine, choline, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine (benzathine), dicyclohexylamine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, iso-propylamine, lidocaine, lysine, meglumine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, and tris-(hydroxymethyl)-methylamine (tromethamine). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0400\" num=\"0400\">[0400] Compounds of the present invention which comprise basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>) alkyl halides, e.g., methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl and tert-butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; di(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>) alkyl sulfate, e.g., dimethyl, diethyl and diamyl sulfates; (C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>18</sub>) alkyl halides, e.g., decyl, dodecyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; and aryl-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>) alkyl halides, e.g., benzyl chloride and phenethyl bromide. Such salts permit the preparation of both water-soluble and oil-soluble compounds of the present invention. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0401\" num=\"0401\">[0401] Among the above-recited pharmaceutical salts those which are preferred include, but are not limited to acetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisuccinate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, meglumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stearate, sulfate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate, and tromethamine. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0402\" num=\"0402\">[0402] The acid addition salts of basic compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the present invention. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0403\" num=\"0403\">[0403] As indicated, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, or organic amines. Preferred metals are sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Preferred organic amines are N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and procaine. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0404\" num=\"0404\">[0404] The base addition salts of acidic compounds of the present invention are prepared by contacting the free acid form with a sufficient amount of the desired base to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free acid form may be regenerated by contacting the salt form with an acid and isolating the free acid form in the conventional manner. The free acid forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to their respective free acid forms for purposes of the present invention. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0405\" num=\"0405\">[0405] Multiple salts forms are included within the scope of the present invention where a compound of the present invention contains more than one group capable of forming such pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of typical multiple salt forms include, but are not limited to bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, diphosphate, disodium, and trihydrochloride. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0406\" num=\"0406\">[0406] In light of the above, it can be seen that the expression \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein is intended to mean an active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0) utilized in the form of a salt thereof, especially where said salt form confers on said active ingredient improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to the free form of said active ingredient or some other salt form of said active ingredient utilized previously. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of said active ingredient may also initially confer a desirable pharmacokinetic property on said active ingredient which it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of said active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0407\" num=\"0407\">[0407] The pharmacokinetic properties of said active ingredient which may be favorably affected include, e.g., the manner in which said active ingredient is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of said active ingredient. While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important, and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of said active ingredient is usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof which it utilized. Further, as the artisan will appreciate, an aqueous solution of said active ingredient will provide the most rapid absorption of said active ingredient into the body of a patient being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid dosage forms, will result in less rapid absorption of said active ingredient. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0408\" num=\"0408\">[0408] Oral ingestion of an active ingredient of Formula (1.0.0) is the most preferred route of administration for reasons of safety, convenience, and economy, but absorption of such an oral dosage form can be adversely affected by physical characteristics such as polarity, emesis caused by irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, destruction by digestive enzymes and low pH, irregular absorption or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and metabolism by enzymes of the mucosa, the intestinal flora, or the liver. Formulation of said active ingredient into different pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms may be effective in overcoming or alleviating one or more of the above-recited problems encountered with absorption of oral dosage forms. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0409\" num=\"0409\">[0409] A compound of Formula (1.0.0) prepared in accordance with the methods described herein can be separated from the reaction mixture in which it is finally produced by any ordinary means known to the chemist skilled in the preparation of organic compounds. Once separated said compound can be purified by known methods. Various methods and techniques can be used as the means for separation and purification, and include, e.g., distillation; recrystallization; column chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; gel chromatography; affinity chromatography; preparative thin-layer chromatography; and solvent extraction. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0410\" num=\"0410\">[0410] 7.1 Stereoisomers </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0411\" num=\"0411\">[0411] A compound within the scope of Formula (1.0.0) may be such that its constituent atoms are capable of being arranged in space in two or more different ways, despite having identical connectivities. As a consequence, said compound exists in the form of stereoisomers. Sys-trans isomerism is but one type of stereoisomerism. Where the stereoisomers are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other, they are enantiomers which have chirality or handedness, because of the presence of one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in their constituent structure. Enantiomers are optically active and therefore distinguishable because they rotate the plane of polarized light by equal amounts, but in opposite directions. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0412\" num=\"0412\">[0412] Where two or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present in a compound of Formula (1.0.0), there are two possible configurations at each said carbon atom. Where two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, for example, there are four possible stereoisomers. Further, these four possible stereoisomers may be arranged into six possible pairs of stereoisomers that are different from each other. In order for a pair of molecules with more than one asymmetric carbon to be enantiomers, they must have different configurations at every asymmetric carbon. Those pairs that are not related as enantiomers have a different stereochemical relationship referred to as a diastereomeric relationship. Stereoisomers that are not enantiomers are called diastereoisomers, or more commonly, diastereomers. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0413\" num=\"0413\">[0413] All of these well known aspects of the stereochemistry of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are contemplated to be a part of the present invention. Within the scope of the present invention there is thus included compounds of Formula (1.0.0) that are stereoisomers, and where these are enantiomers, the individual enantiomers, racemic mixtures of said enantiomers, and artificial, i.e., manufactured mixtures containing proportions of said enantiomers that are different from the proportions of said enantiomers found in a racemic mixture. Where a compound of Formula (1.0.0) comprises stereoisomers that are diastereomers, there is included within the scope of said compound the individual diastereomers as well as mixtures of any two or more of said diastereomers in any proportions thereof. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0414\" num=\"0414\">[0414] By way of illustration, in the case where there is a single asymmetric carbon atom in a compound of Formula (1.0.0), resulting in the (\u2212)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers thereof; there is included within the scope of said compound all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms, prodrugs and metabolites thereof which are therapeutically active and useful in treating or preventing the diseases and conditions described further herein. Where a compound of Formula (1.0.0) exists in the form of (\u2212)(R) and (+)(S) enantiomers, there is also included within the scope of said compound the (+)(S) enantiomer alone, or the (\u2212)(R) enantiomer alone, in the case where all, substantially all, or a predominant share of the therapeutic activity resides in only one of said enantiomers, and/or unwanted side effects reside in only one of said enantiomers. In the case where there is substantially no difference between the biological activities of both enantiomers, there is further included within the scope of said compound of Formula (1.0.0) the (+)(S) enantiomer and the (\u2212)(R) enantiomer present together as a racemic mixture or as a non-racemic mixture in any ratio of proportionate amoun&#39;ts thereof. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0415\" num=\"0415\">[0415] For example, the particular biological activities and/or physical and chemical properties of a pair or set of enantiomers of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) where such exist, may suggest use of said enantiomers in certain ratios to constitute a final therapeutic product. By way of illustration, in the case where there is a pair of enantiomers, they may be employed in ratios such as 90% (R)-10% (S); 80% (R)-20% (S); 70% (R)-30% (S); 60% (R)-40% (S); 50% (R)-50% (S); 40% (R)-60% (S); 30% (R)-70% (S); 20% (R)-80% (S); and 10% (R)-90% (S). After evaluating the properties of the various enantiomers of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) where such exist, the proportionate amount of one or more of said enantiomers with certain desired properties that will constitute the final therapeutic product can be determined in a straightforward manner. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0416\" num=\"0416\">[0416] 7.2 Isotopes </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0417\" num=\"0417\">[0417] There is further contemplated to be included within the scope of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) isotopically-labelled forms thereof. An isotopically-labelled form of a compound of Formula (1.0.0) is identical to said compound but for the fact that one or more atoms of said compound have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. A compound of Formula (1.0.0), a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0418\" num=\"0418\">[0418] An isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0) may be used in a number of beneficial ways. For example, an isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0), e.g., one in which a radioactive isotope such as <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>14</sup>C has been incorporated, will be useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. These radioactive isotopes, i.e., tritium, <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, <sup>14</sup>C, are especially preferred for their ease of preparation and eminent detectability. Incorporation of heavier isotopes, e.g., deuterium, <sup>2</sup>H, into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) will provide therapeutic advantages based on the greater metabolic stability of said isotopically-labelled compound. Greater metabolic stability translates directly into increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, which under most circumstances would constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An isotopically-labelled compound of Formula (1.0.0) can usually be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Synthesis Schemes and related description, Examples, and Preparations herein, substituting a readily available isotopically-labelled reagent for its corresponding non-isotopically-labelled reagent. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0419\" num=\"0419\">[0419] Deuterium, <sup>2</sup>H, can also be incorporated into a compound of Formula (1.0.0) for the purpose of manipulating the oxidative metabolism of said compound by way of the primary kinetic isotope effect. The primary kinetic isotope effect is a change of rate for a chemical reaction that results from substitution of isotopic nuclei, which in turn is caused by the change in ground state energies required for covalent bond formation subsequent to said isotopic substitution. Substitution of a heavier isotope will usually result in a lowering of the ground state energy for a chemical bond, thereby causing a reduction in rate for a rate-limiting bond breaking step. If the bond-breaking event occurs on or near a saddle-point region along the coordinate of a multi-product reaction, the product distribution ratios can be altered substantially. By way of illustration, when deuterium is bound to a carbon atom at a non-exchangeable site, rate differences of k<sub>M</sub>/k<sub>D</sub>=2-7 are typical. This difference in rate, applied successfully to an oxidatively labile compound of Formula (1.0.0), can dramatically affect the profile of said compound in vivo and result in improved pharmacokinetic properties. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0420\" num=\"0420\">[0420] In discovering and developing therapeutic agents, the skilled artisan seeks to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters while retaining desirable in vitro properties. It is a reasonable surmise that many compounds with poor pharmacokinetic profiles suffer from a lability to oxidative metabolism. In vitro liver microsomal assays now available provide valuable information about the course of this oxidative metabolism, which in turn permits the rational design of deuterated compounds of Formula (1.0.0) with improved stability through resistance to such oxidative metabolism. Significant improvements in the pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are thereby obtained, and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of increases in in vivo half-life (t/2), concentration at maximum therapeutic effect (C<sub>max</sub>), area under the dose response curve (AUC), and F; and in terms of decreases in clearance, dose, and cost-of-goods. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0421\" num=\"0421\">[0421] By way of illustration of the above, a compound of Formula (1.0.0) which has multiple potential sites for oxidative metabolism, e.g., benzylic hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms a to a nitrogen atom, is prepared as a series of analogs in which various combinations of hydrogen atoms are replaced by deuterium atoms so that some, most or all of said hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium atoms. Half-life determinations provide an expedient and accurate determination of the extent of improvement in resistance to oxidative metabolism. In this manner it is determined that the half-life of the parent compound can be extended by as much as 100% as the result of such deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0422\" num=\"0422\">[0422] Deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution in a compound of Formula (1.0.0) can also be used to achieve a favorable alteration in the metabolite profile of the parent compound as a way of diminishing or eliminating unwanted toxic metabolites. For example, where a toxic metabolite arises through an oxidative carbon-hydrogen, C\u2014H, bond scission, the deuterated analog is reasonably expected to greatly diminish or eliminate production of the unwanted metabolite, even in the case where the particular oxidation is not a rate-determining step. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0423\" num=\"0423\">[0423] Further information concerning the state of the art with respect to deuterium-for-hydrogen substitution may be found, e.g., in Hanzlik et al., <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>55 3992-3997, 1990; Reider et al., <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>52 3326-3334, 1987; Foster, <i>Adv. Drug Res. </i>14 1-40, 1985; Gillette et al. , <i>Biochemistry </i>33(10) 2927-2937, 1994; and Jarman et al. <i>Carcinogenesis </i>16(4) 683-688, 1993. </p>\\n      <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0424\" num=\"0424\">[0424] 8.0 Therapeutic Applications and Clinical Endpoints </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0425\" num=\"0425\">[0425] The description which follows concerns the therapeutic applications to which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) may be put, and where applicable an explanation of the clinical endpoints associated with such therapeutic applications. There is also set forth a disclosure of various in vitro assays and animal model experiments, which are capable of providing data sufficient to define and demonstrate the therapeutic utility of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0426\" num=\"0426\">[0426] The therapeutic utility of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is applicable to a patient or subject afflicted with a disease or condition as herein set forth and therefore in need of such treatment. The beneficial results are therapeutic whether administered to animals or humans. As used herein the terms \u201canimal\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d is used merely for the purpose of pointing out human beings as opposed to other members of the animal kingdom. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) have therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mammals, and in particular of humans. All of the major subdivisions of the class of mammals (Mammalia) are included within the scope of the present invention with regard to being recipients of therapeutic treatment as described herein. Mammals have value as pets to humans and are therefore likely to be subjects of treatment. This applies especially to the canine and feline groups of mammals. Other mammals are valued as domesticated animals and their treatment in accordance with the present invention is likely in view of the adverse economic impact of not treating the diseases and conditions described herein. This applies especially to the equine, bovine, porcine, and ovine groups of mammals. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0427\" num=\"0427\">[0427] The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit the PDE4 isozyme and thereby have a wide range of therapeutic applications, as described further below, because of the essential role which the PDE4 family of isozymes plays in the physiology of all mammals. The enzymatic role performed by the PDE4 isozymes is the intracellular hydrolysis of adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cAMP) within pro-inflammatory leukocytes. cAMP, in turn, is responsible for mediating the effects of numerous hormones in the body, and as a consequence, PDE4 inhibition plays a significant role in a variety of physiological processes. There is extensive literature in the art describing the effects of PDE inhibitors on various inflammatory cell responses, which in addition to cAMP elevation, include inhibition of superoxide production, degranulation, chemotaxis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0428\" num=\"0428\">[0428] PDE4 was first identified in 1985, Nemoz et al. <i>Biochem. Pharmacol. </i>34 2997-3000, 1985, and the PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and denbufylline were studied early on in clinical trials for CNS indications such as depression. Subsequently, it was established that PDE4 is the principal phosphodiesterase in inflammatory leukocytes. The four subtypes of PDE4, i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D, are widely distributed in human tissues, as determined by the presence of their mRNAs. PDE4D is expressed in kidney, thymus, small intestine, and colon tissues, and is strongly expressed in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, prostate, and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) tissues. It is only weakly expressed in heart, placenta, liver, pancreas, spleen, testes, and ovary tissues. PDE4A and PDE4B are also strongly expressed in brain and skeletal muscle tissues, and only weakly expressed in placenta, liver, and ovary tissues. PDE4C is strongly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue as well, and is also weakly expressed in ovary tissue. PDE4C is usually not detectable in the majority of the above-mentioned tissues. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0429\" num=\"0429\">[0429] The PDE4 family of isozymes is the predominant form of phosphodiesterase found in cell types implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, and among bone-marrow derived cell types, only platelets do not express PDE. PDE4 is the major cAMP-metabolizing enzyme in immune and inflammatory cells, and is one of two major cAMP-metabolizing enzymes in airway smooth muscle. PDE4 is exclusively present in neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocyctes, while in macrophages PDE3 and PDE1 activity, and in T lymphocytes PDE7 activity has also been demonstrated. The beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of inhibitors of PDE have been demonstrated heretofore using in vitro experiments, which have established that such compounds inhibit superoxide generation in human monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils; mediator release in basophils, macrophages, and neutrophils; and TNF\u03b1 release in monocytes and macrophages. PDE inhibitors also inhibit mediator release of inflammatory cells like monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, lung mast cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0430\" num=\"0430\">[0430] Beneficial anti-inflammatory effects have also been observed in vivo heretofore, including inhibition of microvascular leakage into the lungs of sensitized guinea pigs, and reduction of bronchial hyper-reactivity and eosinophilia in cynomolgus monkeys following repeated antigen challenge. It has also been demonstrated heretofore that PDE4 inhibitors potently suppress TNF\u03b1 release from mononuclear phagocytes. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0431\" num=\"0431\">[0431] 8.1 Asthma </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0432\" num=\"0432\">[0432] One of the most important respiratory diseases treatable with PDE4, especially PDE4D inhibitors of the type within the scope of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) is asthma, a chronic, increasingly common disorder encountered worldwide and characterized by intermittent reversible airway obstruction, airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation. The cause of asthma has yet to be determined, but the most common pathological expression of asthma is inflammation of the airways, which may be significant even in the airways of patients with mild asthma. Based on bronchial biopsy and lavage studies it has been clearly shown that asthma involves infiltration by mast cells, eosinophils, and T-lymphocytes into a patient&#39;s airways. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in atopic asthmatics shows activation of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5 and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that suggests the presence of a T-helper 2 (Th-2)-like T-cell population. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0433\" num=\"0433\">[0433] Compounds of Formula (1.0.0) inhibit PDE4 in human eosinophils and are therefore useful in the treatment of atopic and non-atopic asthma. The term \u201catopy\u201d refers to a genetic predisposition toward the development of type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions against common environmental antigens. The most common clinical manifestation is allergic rhinitis, while bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy occur less frequently. Accordingly, the expression \u201catopic asthma\u201d as used herein is intended to be synonymous with \u201callergic asthma\u201d, i.e., bronchial asthma which is an allergic manifestation in a sensitized person. The term \u201cnon-atopic asthma\u201d as used herein is intended to refer to all other asthmas, especially essential or \u201ctrue\u201d asthma, which is provoked by a variety of factors, including vigorous exercise, irritant particles, psychologic stresses, etc. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0434\" num=\"0434\">[0434] The use of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to treat atopic asthma or non-atopic asthma is established and demonstrated by the models of PDE inhibition, inhibition of eosinophil activation, and the cell infiltration models described below. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0435\" num=\"0435\">[0435] Pulmonary Inflammation in Allergic Cynomolgus Monkeys </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0436\" num=\"0436\">[0436] The ability of the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention to inhibit Ascaris antigen induced increases in the inflammatory cell content of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid from cynomolgus monkey subjects is evaluated in this method. Using a cross-over design, 8-10 Ascaris-sensitive cynomolgus monkeys are treated with vehicle or drug. At appropriate pretreatment time, each monkey is anesthetized (ketamine 10 m/kg +xylazine 1 mg/kg, i.m.) and intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed using one 15 ml wash of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) delivered through a pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscope inserted through the endotracheal tube and wedged into a third to fifth generation bronchus. Lavage fluid is gently aspirated and collected in a syringe. After BAL is complete, each animal receives a 2 min exposure to a concentration of Ascaris suum aerosol which doubles respiratory system resistance determined in previous experiments. Each monkey is returned to its cage and 24 hr later a second lavage is performed, using 15 ml PBS, on the opposite side of the lung. One week after the first trial, control and treated monkeys are reversed and the experiment repeated. To determine the percent composition of each leukocyte type, two slides from each monkey BAL sample is obtained by centrifuging 2\u00d7150 ul lavage fluid for 2 min@500 rpm in Cytospin centrifuge. Slides are stained in Diff-Quick for differential cell count and cells identified by standard morphological criteria. Total leukocyte numbers per milliliter of BAL fluid are determined by diluting 20 \u03bcl of sample in 20 ml Isoton, adding 3 drops of Zapoglobin to lyse erythrocytes and reading the sample using a Coulter Counter. Comparisons are made between the ratio of increase in bronchial alveolar lavage eosinophil, cytokine or mediator levels, pre-antigen challenge versus 24 hours post antigen challenge, with and without drug treatment. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0437\" num=\"0437\">[0437] In the above test model the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention exhibit anti-inflammatory activity at dosages in the range of from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg i.v. or 0.01 to 10.0 mg/kg p.o. or 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg i.t. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0438\" num=\"0438\">[0438] Another useful assay, based on the use of primates, is that described in Turner et al., \u201cCharacterization of a primate model of asthma using anti-allergy/anti-asthma agents,\u201d <i>Inflammation Research </i>45 239-245, 1996. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0439\" num=\"0439\">[0439] Anti-Inflammatory Activity </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0440\" num=\"0440\">[0440] The anti-inflammatory activity of the combinations of therapeutic agents of the present invention is demonstrated by the inhibition of eosinophil activation as measured by sephadex bead stimulated LTE4 production in whole human blood. Whole Blood Assay for LTE4 using Sephadex Beads as Stimulant. On the day before the assay, siliconize glass tubes with Sigmacote (Sigma, Cat# SL-2). Before Drawing the blood, dilute compounds in DMSO 1000\u00d7, add 1 \u03bcl of either DMSO or compound to each respective tube, and place rack of tubes in 37\u00b0 C. water bath. Have Blood drawn into heparinized Vacutainer tube #6480 (143USP units sodium heparin, 10ml), 10 tubes=100 ml blood. Pool Blood tubes in two 50 ml conical tubes. Add 1 ml of whole blood to each siliconized tube containing DMSO or compound VORTEX and then incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. To prepare the Sephadex G-15 beads (Pharmacia, Cat# 17-0020-01) suspension, add 3.3 g. of Sephadex G-15, mix with 20 mls of PBS in a 100 ml beaker then mix with a magnetic stir bar. After 15 minutes, add 100 \u03bcl of Sephadex G-15 beads to each tube except the Sephadex tubes which will provide the baseline value for LTE4 release. Vortex and incubate for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. At the end of 90 minutes incubation, add 20 \u03bcl of 15% EDTA, VORTEX and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. Then remove and save the plasma sample for analysis. LTE4 levels are determined by Cayman&#39;s Cysteinyl-LT ELISA kit (Cat #520501). Percent inhibition is calculated as 100\u00d71\u2014(LTE4 concentration in the drug treated sample divided by the LTE4 concentration in the non-drug treated control samples). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0441\" num=\"0441\">[0441] Compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are active in the above test method at concentrations in the range of from 0.0001 \u03bcM to 20.0 \u03bcM, with preferred embodiments being active at concentrations in the range of from 0.5 nM to 1000 nM. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0442\" num=\"0442\">[0442] From the above it may be seen that compounds of Formula (1 0.0) are useful for the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases or other conditions involving airways obstruction.

COPD is characterized by irreversible, progressive airways obstruction. Chronic bronchitis is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mucus secreting glands of the submucosa in the large cartilaginous airways. Goblet cell hyperplasia, mucosal and submucosal inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, fibrosis, mucus plugs and increased smooth muscle are all found in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles. The small airways are known to be a major site of airway obstruction. Emphysema is characterized by destruction of the alveolar wall and loss of lung elasticity. A number of risk factors have also been identified as linked to the incidence of COPD. The link between tobacco smoking and COPD is well established. Other risk factors include exposure to coal dust and various genetic factors. See Sandford et al., \u201cGenetic risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\u201d <i>Eur. Respir. J. </i>10 1380-1391, 1997. The incidence of COPD is increasing and it represents a significant economic burden on the populations of the industrialized nations. COPD also presents itself clinically with a wide range of variation from simple chronic bronchitis without disability to patients in a severely disabled state with chronic respiratory failure. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0452\" num=\"0452\">[0452] COPD is characterized by inflammation of the airways, as is the case with asthma, but the inflammatory cells that have been found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum of patients neutrophils rather than eosinophils. Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators are also found in COPD patients, including IL-8, LTB<sub>4</sub>, and TNF-\u03b1, and the surface epithelium and sub-epithelium of the bronchi of such patients has been found to be infiltrated by T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Symptomatic relief for COPD patients can be provided by the use of \u03b2-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators, but the progress of the disease remains unaltered. COPD has been treated using theophylline, but without much success, even though it reduces neutrophil counts in the sputum of COPD patients. Steroids have also failed to hold out much promise as satisfactory treatment agents in COPD. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0453\" num=\"0453\">[0453] Accordingly, the use of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to treat COPD and its related and included obstructed airways diseases, represents a significant advance in the art The present invention is not limited to any particular mode of action or any hypothesis as to the way in which the desired therapeutic objectives have been obtained by utilizing the compounds of Formula (1.0.0).

It may affect the tube uniformly, in which case it is referred to as cylindric bronchiectasis, or it may occur in irregular pockets, in which case it is called sacculated bronchiectasis. When the dilated bronchial tubes have terminal bulbous enlargements, the term fusiform bronchiectasis is used. In those cases where the condition of dilatation extends to the bronchioles, it is referred to as capillary bronchiectasis. If the dilatation of the bronchi is spherical in shape, the condition is referred to as cystic bronchiectasis. Dry bronchiectasis occurs where the infection involved is episodic and it may be accompanied by hemoptysis, the expectoration of blood or of blood-stained sputum. During quiescent periods of dry bronchiectasis, the coughing which occurs is nonproductive. Follicular bronchiectasis is a type of bronchiectasis in which the lymphoid tissue in the affected regions becomes greatly enlarged, and by projection into the bronchial lumen, may seriously distort and partially obstruct the bronchus.

The trachea is transected in the transverse plane at alternate cartilage plates so as to give rings of tissue 3-5 mm in depth. The proximal and distal rings are discarded. Individual rings are mounted vertically on stainless steel supports, one of which is fixed at the base of an organ bath, while the other is attached to an isometric transducer.

Allergic rhinitis is divided into two disease categories, seasonal and perennial, in which the former is attributed to pollen or outdoor mould spores, while the latter is attributed to common allergens such as house dust mites, animal danders, and mould spores. Allergic rhinitis generally exhibits an early phase response and a late phase response. The early phase response is associated with mast cell degranulation, while the late phase response is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and T-lymphocytes. A variety of inflammatory mediators is also released by these cells, all of which may contribute to the inflammation exhibited in the late phase response. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0470\" num=\"0470\">[0470] A particularly prevalent form of seasonal allergic rhinitis is hay fever, which is marked by acute conjunctivitis with lacrimation and itching, swelling of the nasal mucosa, nasal catarrh, sudden attacks of sneezing, and often with asthmatic symptoms. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are especially useful in the beneficial treatment of hay fever. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0471\" num=\"0471\">[0471] Other types of rhinitis for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) may be used as therapeutic agents include acute catarrhal rhinitis which is a cold in the head involving acute congestion of the mucous membrane of the nose, marked by dryness and followed by increased mucous secretion from the membrane, impeded respiration through the nose, and some pain; atrophic rhinitis which is a chronic form marked by wasting of the mucous membrane and the glands; purulent rhinitis which is chronic rhinitis with the formation of pus; and vasomotor rhinitis which is a non-allergic rhinitis in which transient changes in vascular tone and permeability with the same symptoms as allergic rhinitis, are brought on by such stimuli as mild chilling, fatigue, anger, and anxiety. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0472\" num=\"0472\">[0472] There is a recognized link between allergic rhinitis and asthma. Allergic rhinitis is a frequent accompaniment to asthma, and it has been demonstrated that treating allergic rhinitis will improve asthma. Epidemiologic data has also been used to show a link between severe rhinitis and more severe asthma. For example, the compound D-22888, under preclinical development for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, has been shown to exhibit a strong anti-allergic affect and to inhibit rhinorrhea in the antigen-challenged pig.

Sinusitis is the inflammation of a sinus and this condition may be purulent or nonpurulent, as well as acute or chronic. Depending upon the sinus where the inflammation is located, the condition is known as ethmoid, frontal, maxillary, or sphenoid sinusitis. The ethmoidal sinus is one type of paranasal sinus, located in the ethmoid bone. The frontal sinus is one of the paired paranasal sinuses located in the frontal bone. The maxillary sinus is one of the paired paranasal sinuses located in the body of the maxilla.

Late stages of rheumatoid arthritis are marked by ankylosis and deformity. Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling autoimmune disease of unknown etiology which affects over 1% of the population. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0476\" num=\"0476\">[0476] As used herein, the term \u201crheumatoid arthritis\u201d is intended to include within its scope where applicable related and associated forms of arthritis well known In the art, since these may also be treated with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). Accordingly, the term \u201crheumatoid arthritis\u201d includes acute arthritis, which is arthritis marked by pain, heat, redness, and swelling due to inflammation, infection, or trauma; acute gouty arthritis, which is acute arthritis associated with gout; chronic inflammatory arthritis, which is inflammation of the joints in chronic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis; degenerative arthritis, which is osteoarthritis; infectious arthritis, which is arthritis caused by bacteria, rickettsiae, mycoplasmas, viruses, fungi, or parasites; Lyme arthritis, which is arthritis of the large joints associated with Lyme 20 disease; proliferative arthritis, which is inflammation of the joints with proliferation of the synovium, seen in rheumatoid arthritis; psoriatic arthritis, which is a syndrome in which psoriasis occurs in association with inflammatory arthritis; and vertebral arthritis, which is inflammation involving the intervertebral disks. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0477\" num=\"0477\">[0477] The three major pathological features of rheumatoid arthritis that are responsible for progressive joint destruction are inflammation, abnormal cellular and humoral responses, and synovial hyperplasia. The particular cellular pathology of rheumatoid arthritis includes the presence of T-cells and monocytes. The T-cells, which are predominantly memory T-cells, constitute up to 50% of the cells recovered from the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients; and of the monocytes found in the same tissue, 30-50% are antigen presenting cells, which is indicative of the autoimmune character of the disease. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and TNF-\u03b1, are the major contributors to joint tissue damage, inflammation, hyperplasia, pannus formation and bone resorption.

The ability of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to facilitate the release of cytokine IL-10 from monocytes, which in turn is capable of decreasing the generation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13, and GM-CSF by synovial fluid mononuclear cells, further augments the overall anti-inflammatory profile of the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula(1.0.0); Kambayashi el al, Ibid. Further, the ability of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 release from stimulated monocytes can be correlated with animal models of inflammation in which anti-inflammatory effects can be shown to correspond to suppression of TNF-\u03b1 accumulation. One such animal model involves inhibition of LPS induced TNF-\u03b1 release in mice by oral administration of a PDE4 inhibitor; Cheng et al, \u201cThe phosphodiesterase Type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor CP-80,633 elevates cyclic AMP levels and decreases TNF-\u03b1 production in mice: effect of adrenalectomy,\u201d <i>J.

In this study the dosing regimen for rolipram was 2 mg/kg twice daily for five days before the onset of arthritis, and it significantly delayed the appearance of arthritic symptoms. After the cessation of treatment the test animals developed arthritis and reached the same arthritis top score as the control group. In the same study rolipram was also administered at 3 mg/kg twice daily at the time point when arthritis was apparent. This treatment drastically changed the development of the disease whereby progression of severity was halted and even after the cessation of treatment, the arthritis score did not reach the levels observed in untreated animals. The investigators were also able to demonstrate a strong down-regulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in regional lymph nodes, which suggests that the major effect of rolipram is exerted in the effector phase of the inflammatory process.

Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the therapeutic treatment of eosinophil-related disorders. Such disorders include eosinophilia, which is the formation and accumulation of an abnormally large number of eosinophils in the blood. The name of the disorder derives from \u201ceosin\u201d, a rose-colored stain or dye comprising a bromine derivative of fluorescein which readily stains \u201ceosinophilic leukocytes\u201d in the blood of patients who are thus readily identified. A particular eosinophilic disorder that can be treated in accordance with the present invention is pulmonary infiltration eosinophilia, which is characterized by the infiltration of the pulmonary parenchyma by eosinophils. This disorder includes especially Loffler&#39;s syndrome, which is a condition characterized by transient infiltrations of the lungs, accompanied by cough, fever, dyspnea, and eosinophilia. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0491\" num=\"0491\">[0491] Other eosinophilic disorders include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, which is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by cough, dyspnea, malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, eosinophilia, and a chest film revealing non-segmental, non-migratory infiltrates in the lung periphery; tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, which is a subacute or chronic form of occult filariasis, usually involving <i>Brugia malayi, Wuchereria bancrofti</i>, or filariae that infect animals, occurs in the tropics, and is characterized by episodic nocturnal wheezing and coughing, strikingly elevated eosinophilia, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrations of the lungs; bronchopneumonic aspergillosis, which is an infection of the bronchi and lungs by Aspergillus funga resulting in a diseased condition marked by inflammatory granulomatous lesions in the nasal sinuses and lungs, but also in the skin, ear, orbit, and sometimes in the bones and meninges, and leading to aspergilloma, the most common type of fungus ball formed by colonization of Aspergillus in a bronchus or lung cavity. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0492\" num=\"0492\">[0492] The term \u201cgranulomatous\u201d means containing granulomas, and the term \u201cgranuloma\u201d refers to any small nodular delimited aggregation of mononuclear inflammatory cells or such a collection of modified macrophages resembling epithelial cells, usually surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes, with fibrosis commonly seen around the lesion. Some granulomas contain eosinophils. Granuloma formation represents a chronic inflammatory response initiated by various infectious and noninfectious agents. A number of such granulomatous conditions are treatable using a compound of Formula (1.0.0), e.g., allergic granulomatous angiitis, also called Churg-Strauss syndrome, which is a form of systemic necrotizing vasculitis in which there is prominent lung involvement, generally manifested by eosinophilia, granulomatous reactions, and usually severe asthma. A related disorder is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), which is marked by multiple inflammatory and destructive arterial lesions and is a form of systemic necrotizing vasculitis involving the small and medium-sized arteries with signs and symptoms resulting from infarction and scarring of the affected organ system, in particular the lungs. Other eosinophil-related disorders which may be treated in accordance with the present invention are those affecting the airways which are induced or occasioned by a reaction to a therapeutic agent unrelated to any compound of Formula (1.0.0). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0493\" num=\"0493\">[0493] 8.7 Atopic Dermatitis, Urticaria, Conjunctivitis, and Uveitis </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0494\" num=\"0494\">[0494] Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder seen in individuals with a hereditary predisposition to a lowered cutaneous threshold to pruritis, that is often accompanied by allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and asthma, and that is principally characterized by extreme itching. Atopic dermatitis is also called allergic dermatitis, and allergic or atopic eczema. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0495\" num=\"0495\">[0495] Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in young children, and it affects from 10% to 15% of the population during childhood. Atopic dermatitis is frequently associated with asthma and allergies and it has therefore become known as a component of the so-called \u201catopic triad\u201d, since it occurs frequently in individuals with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. See Leung Dym, <i>Atopic Dermatitis: From Pathogenesis To Treatment</i>, R.G. Landes Co., Austin, Tex., 1-226, 1996. Accordingly, the immune dysfunction associated with atopic dermatitis is treatable with therapeutic agents that are inhibitors of PDE4. For example, rolipram, Ro-201724, and denbufylline have been reported to produce a concentration-related inhibition of the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBM) from normal patients as well as from subjects with atopic dermatitis. See, respectively, Torphy et al, <i>Drugs and the Lung</i>, Eds. Page and Metzger, Raven Press, New York, 1994; and O&#39;Brien, <i>Mol. Medicine Today, </i>369, 1997. These studies also determined that the proliferative response of HPBM from atopic dermatitis patients was more sensitive to PDE4 inhibition than was the proliferation observed in HPBM from normal subjects. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0496\" num=\"0496\">[0496] Th2 type cytokine secreting T-cells expressing the cutaneous lymphocyte associated antigen play a central role in the induction of local IgE responses and the recruitment of eosinophils in this disease. The chronic inflammation seen in atopic dermatitis is considered to be the result of several interdependent factors, such as repeated or persistent allergen exposure, which can lead to Th2 cell expansion. It has been demonstrated that there is an increased frequency of allergen specific T-cells producing increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-3 levels in the blood of atopic dermatitis patients. See Leung Dym et al., \u201cAllergic and immunological skin disorders,\u201d <i>JAMA </i>278(22) 1914-1923, 1997. This is significant because IL-4 and IL-3 induce the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), an adhesion molecule involved in the migration of mononuclear cells and eosinophils into sites of tissue inflammation. Further, IL-5 is a key mediator of eosinophil activation, which is a common feature of atopic disease. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0497\" num=\"0497\">[0497] Increased concentration of cAMP in lymphocytes and basophils has long been known to be associated with decreased mediator release from those cells, and more recently it has been reported that histamine acting on H2 receptors increases cAMP levels and inhibits IL-4 production in murine Th2 cells. It is surmised, accordingly, that there is present in atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, impaired p-adrenergic responses or enhanced PDE4 activity of leukocyte inflammatory responses. A diminished cAMP response may result from an enhanced PDE4 activity that has a genetic basis or that is an acquired condition. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0498\" num=\"0498\">[0498] Studies have been carried out which compare different cell types from atopic patients with those from healthy volunteers, and the results have shown that increased cAMP-PDE activity in atopic cells correlates with abnormal inflammatory and immune cell function in atopic dermatitis. Further, the PDE4 enzyme from atopic leukocytes is more sensitive to PDE4 inhibitors than the PDE4 enzyme from normal leukocytes, and up to a 14-Fold difference has been demonstrated. See Chan and Hanifin, \u201cDifferential inhibitory effects of cAMP phosphodiesterase isoforms in atopic and normal leukocytes,\u201d <i>J. Lab. Clin. Med., </i>121(1) 44-51, 1993. An increased sensitivity can also be seen in the inhibition of proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from atopic donors on treatment with PDE4 inhibitors. For example, rolipram has been found to be more effective at inhibiting PHA stimulated atopic dermatitis PBMC proliferation than at inhibiting PHA stimulated normal PBMC proliferation, with an IC<sub>50</sub>=280 nM compared to an IC<sub>50</sub>=2600 nM, respectively. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0499\" num=\"0499\">[0499] Further, it has been shown that a structurally diverse range of selective PDE4 inhibitors are effective in reducing skin eosinophilia in the guinea pig which has been mediated via a range of agents such as PAF, arachidonic acid, zymosan activated plasma, and protein of cutaneous anaphylaxis. See Beasley et al., \u201cSynthesis and evaluation of a novel series of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors. A potential treatment for asthma,\u201d <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Letts. </i>8 2629-2634, 1998. Such data shows the utility of PDE4 inhibitors in treating eosinophil driven skin diseases. Such treatment is by means of topical administration, e.g., topical atizoram applied bilaterally over eight days to twenty patients in a clinical trial has been found to effectively inhibit all of the inflammatory parameters tested, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements with no adverse effects. See Hanifin et al., \u201cType 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitors have clinical and in vitro anti-inflammatory effects in atopic dermatitis,\u201d <i>J. Invest. Dermatol. </i>107 51-56, 1996. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0500\" num=\"0500\">[0500] Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of atopic dermatitis as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in the treatment of urticaria. Urticaria is a vascular reaction, usually transient, involving the upper dermis, representing localized edema caused by dilatation and increased permeability of the capillaries, and marked by the development of wheals or hives. Many different stimuli are capable of inducing an urticarial reaction, and it may be classified according to precipitating causes, as: immune-mediated, complement-mediated which may involve immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanisms, urticariogenic material-induced, physical agent-induced, stress-induced, or idiopathic. The condition may also be designated acute or chronic depending on the duration of an attack. Angioedema is the same response in the deep dermis or subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0501\" num=\"0501\">[0501] The most common types of urticaria which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are cholinergic urticaria which is characterized by the presence of distinctive punctate wheals surrounded by areas of erythema, thought to be a nonimmunologic hypersensitivity reaction in which acetylcholine released from parasympathetic or motor nerve terminals induces release of mediators from mast cells, and evoked by conditions of exertion, stress, or increased environmental heat; cold urticaria which is urticaria precipitated by cold air, water, or objects, occurring in two forms: In the autosomal dominant form which is associated with fevers, arthralgias, and leukocytosis, the lesions present are erythematous, burning papules and macules, and in the more common acquired form which is usually idiopathic and self-limited; contact urticaria which is a localized or generalized transient wheal-and-flare response elicited by exposure to rapidly absorbable urticariogenic agents; giant urticaria which is angioedema; and papular urticaria which is a persistent cutaneous eruption representing a hypersensitivity reaction to insect bites. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0502\" num=\"0502\">[0502] Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of urticaria as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in various ophthalmic uses, in particular in the treatment of conjunctivitis and uveitis. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0503\" num=\"0503\">[0503] The conjunctiva is a delicate membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the exposed surface of the sclera. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva that generally consists of conjunctival hyperemia associated with a discharge. The most common types of conjunctivitis, which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), are actinic conjunctivitis produced by ultraviolet light; acute catarrhal conjunctivitis which is an acute, infectious conjunctivitis associated with cold or catarrh and characterized by vivid hyperemia, edema, loss of translucence, and mucous or mucopurulent discharge; acute contagious conjunctivitis which is a mucopurulent, epidemic conjunctivitis caused by Haemophilus aegyptius that has the same symptoms as acute catarrhal conjunctivitis and is also called \u201cpinkeye\u201d; allergic conjunctivitis which is a component of hay fever; atopic conjunctivitis which is allergic conjunctivitis of the immediate type caused by airborne allergens, e.g., pollens, dusts, spores, and animal dander; chronic catarrhal conjunctivitis which is a mild, chronic conjunctivitis with only slight hyperemia and mucous discharge; purulent conjunctivitis which is an acute conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or viruses, particularly gonococci, meningococci, pneumococci, and streptococci, and characterized by severe inflammation of the conjunctiva and copious discharge of pus; and vernal conjunctivitis which is a bilateral conjunctivitis of seasonal occurrence, of unknown cause, affecting children especially boys and characterized by flattened papules and a thick, gelatinous exudate. Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of conjunctivitis as described above. A related area of therapeutic application for which the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also produce beneficial results is in the treatment of uveitis. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0504\" num=\"0504\">[0504] The uvea is the vascular middle coat or tunic of the eye, comprising the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis is an inflammation of all or part of the uvea and commonly involves the other tunics of the eye, i.e., the sclera and the cornea, and the retina as well. The most common types of uveitis, which are treatable with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0), are anterior uveitis which is uveitis involving the structures of the iris and/or ciliary body, including iritis, cyclitis, and iridocyclitis; granulomatous uveitis which is uveitis of any part of the uveal tract but particularly of the posterior portion, characterized by nodular collections of epithelioid cells and giant cells surrounded by lymphocytes; nongranulomatous uveitis which is inflammation of the anterior portion of the uveal tract, i.e., the iris and ciliary body; phacoantigenic uveitis which is one of the lens-induced uveitides is a severe anterior uveitis similar to sympathetic ophthalmia, observed weeks or even months after extracapsular lens surgery or other trauma to the capsule; and posterior uveitis which is uveitis involving the posterior segment of the eye, including choroiditis and chorioretinitis. Accordingly, the PDE4 inhibitors of Formula (1.0.0) are useful for the beneficial treatment of the various types of unveitis as described above. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0505\" num=\"0505\">[0505] 8.8 Psoriasis </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0506\" num=\"0506\">[0506] Psoriasis is a common chronic, squamous dermatosis with polygenic inheritance and a fluctuating course that is characterized by microabscesses and spongiform pustules, as well as erythematous, dry, scaling patches of various sizes. Psoriasis is a common skin disease that affects approximately 2% of the population, and more than 1\u00bd million patients in the US annually consult physicians for treatment. Psoriasis is usually recurrent and in some instances can be very debilitating. The etiology of psoriasis is unknown, but it appears to be an autoimmune disease with genetic predisposition. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0507\" num=\"0507\">[0507] Psoriasis involves a large T-cell infiltration in the affected regions of the skin, with CD4+ lymphocytes in the dermis and CD8+ lymphocytes in the epidermis. These lymphocytes secrete IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1, which alter keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Further, from 5% to 10% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis, the symptoms of which are very similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. The broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activities displayed by PDE4 inhibitors, already discussed above, enables such inhibitors to be used beneficially in the treatment of psoriasis. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0508\" num=\"0508\">[0508] It has been demonstrated that treatment of epidermal basal cells, in primary culture, with the PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 leads to a three-fold increase in cAMP concentrations. It has also been shown that treatment of psoriatic epidermal slices and keratomed psoriatic epidermal slices with Ro 20-1724 results in a very marked elevation of cAMP concentrations over controls. Specifically, a 1395% increase in cAMP concentration in keratomed psoriatic epidermis has been observed. PDE4 inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit the inflammatory response of a number of mediators via either topical or systemic administration. For example, rolipram has been shown to inhibit croton oil-induced ear inflammation in the mouse at topical doses as low as 0.03 mg per ear. The selective PDE4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 has also been investigated in two double-blind studies comparing its effectiveness to vehicle, where it has been shown to improve psoriatic lesions without adverse systemic or cutaneous effects. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0509\" num=\"0509\">[0509] 8.9 Multiple Sclerosis and Other Inflammatory Autoimmune Diseases </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0510\" num=\"0510\">[0510] A sclerosis is an induration, or hardening, and refers especially to hardening of a part from inflammation, and from increased formation of connective tissue and in diseases of the interstitial substance. The term \u201csclerosis\u201d is used chiefly for such a hardening of the nervous system due to the deposition of connective tissue, or to designate hardening of the blood vessels. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which there are foci of demyelination of various sizes throughout the white matter of the central nervous system, sometimes extending into the gray matter, resulting in weakness, incoordination, paresthesias, speech disturbances, and visual complaints. Multiple sclerosis is a disease of unknown etiology with a prolonged course involving many remissions and relapses. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0511\" num=\"0511\">[0511] Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that in addition to chronic inflammation and demyelination, also results in gliosis within the central nervous system. There are several disease subtypes, including primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. These disease subtypes may be distinguished from each other on the basis of the course of the disease, of the type of inflammation involved, and through the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is also possible for the basic disease mechanism to change during the course of multiple sclerosis, with an inflammation-based process being replaced later by one which involves demyelination and axonal damage. See Weilbach and Gold, \u201cDisease modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis. What is on the horizon?\u201d <i>CNS Drugs </i>11 133-157, 1999. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0512\" num=\"0512\">[0512] In multiple sclerosis inflammatory lesions are localized to, but prevalent throughout the white matter of the central nervous system, although sclerotic plaques characterized by demyelination are a hallmark of the disease. The development of demyelination, in turn, is caused by the necrosis of oligodendrocytes, and demyelination is associated with an infiltrate composed mainly of T-cells and macrophages, which together with local cells such as astrocytes, microglia and microvascular brain endothelial cells, express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. These cells are thus implicated in antigen presentation and an inflammatory response, and a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2, IL-1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 have been identified in the brain tissue of multiple sclerosis patients and their presence is generally associated with active lesions. TNF-\u03b1 in particular has been the focus of attention because it mediates myelin and oligodendrocyte damage in vitro, induces astrocytes to express surface adhesion molecules, and is associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0513\" num=\"0513\">[0513] Animal models have been used to demonstrate the role of TNF-\u03b1 in multiple sclerosis, e.g., in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) administration of anti-TNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptors has been shown to provide a protective effect. See Selmaj et al., \u201cPrevention of chronic relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by soluble tumor necrosis factor,\u201d <i>J. Neuroimmunol. </i>56 135-141, 1995. A direct correlation between the level of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and progression of EAE has also been reported. See Reeno et al., \u201cTNF-alpha expression by resident microglia and infiltrating leukocytes in the central nervous system of mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis: regulation by the Th1 cytokines,\u201d <i>J. Immunol. </i>154 944-953, 1995. Further evidence demonstrating that TNF-\u03b1 is a mediator of multiple sclerosis is the increased concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients during the course of the disease. Further, a transgenic mouse overexpressing TNF-\u03b1 in the central nervous system has shown signs of spontaneous demyelination, while a transgenic TNF-\u03b1 knockout mouse has shown a protective effect. See Probert et al., \u201cSpontaneous inflammatory demyelinating disease in transgenic mice showing central nervous system-specific expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha,\u201d <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA </i>92 11294-11298, 1995; and Liu et al., \u201cTNF is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine in autoimmune-mediated demyelination,\u201d <i>Nature Med. </i>4 78-83, 1998. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0514\" num=\"0514\">[0514] Since PDE4 inhibitors also reduce TNF-\u03b1, they are beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis because TNF-\u03b1 plays a key role in mediating multiple sclerosis, as discussed above. For example, in a marmoset model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis rolipram has been found to suppress the appearance of clinical signs and abolish abnormalities in MRI imaging. In another study of the effects of rolipram on chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in SJL mice, it has been shown that rolipram ameliorates clinical signs and pathological changes in this model. See Genain et al., \u201cPrevention of autoimmune demyelination in non-human primates by a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase,\u201d <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc!

Related diseases of the bowel include collagenous colitis, which is a type of colitis of unknown etiology that is characterized by deposits of collagenous material beneath the epithelium of the colon, and marked by crampy abdominal pain with a conspicuous reduction in fluid and electrolyte absorption that leads to watery diarrhea; colitis polyposa, which is ulcerative colitis associated with the formation of pseudopolyps, i.e., edematous, inflamed islands of mucosa between areas of ulceration; and transmural colitis, which is inflammation of the full thickness of the bowel, rather than mucosal and submucosal disease, usually with the formation of noncaseating granulomas, that clinically resembles ulcerative colitis but in which the ulceration is often longitudinal or deep, the disease is often segmental, stricture formation is common, and fistulas, particularly in the perineum, are a frequent complication. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0520\" num=\"0520\">[0520] Crohn&#39;s disease (CD) is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology involving any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but commonly involving the terminal ileum with scarring and thickening of the bowel wall, frequently leading to intestinal obstruction, and fistula and abscess formation, and having a high rate of recurrence after treatment. Ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#39;s disease and the related diseases discussed above are collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These diseases are chronic, spontaneously relapsing disorders of unknown cause that are immunologically mediated and whose pathogenesis has been established through the use of animal models and advanced immunological techniques. See Bickston and Caminelli, \u201cRecent developments in the medical therapy of IBD,\u201d <i>Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. </i>14 6-10, 1998; and Murthy et al., \u201cInflammatory bowel disease: A new wave of therapy,\u201d <i>Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents </i>8(7) 785-818, 1998. While the incidence of ulcerative colitis has remained relatively stable, the incidence of Crohn&#39;s disease has increased significantly. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0521\" num=\"0521\">[0521] Current therapy for inflammatory bowel disease includes 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate. These agents have a wide range of adverse side effects and do not modify the disease itself, and there is thus an ongoing need for more effective treatment agents. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are able to beneficially treat inflammatory bowel diseases as a result of their ability to inhibit the production of TNF-\u03b1, because TNF-\u03b1 causes immune cell activation, proliferation, and mediator release in inflammatory bowel disease. See Radford-Smith and Jewell, \u201cCytokines and inflammatory bowel disease.\u201d <i>Baillieres Clin. Gasteroenterol. </i>10 151-164, 1996. TNF-\u03b1 has also been detected in the stools and intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Further, early clinical studies in Crohn&#39;s disease using TNF monoclonal antibodies have shown significant promise. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0522\" num=\"0522\">[0522] As already detailed further above, selective PDE4 inhibitors have a marked effect on the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells after those cells have been stimulated with a wide range of mediators, both in vitro and in vivo. The selective PDE4 inhibitor arofylline has been shown to provide beneficial effects when tested in models of colitis in the rat. Further, in a dextran sulfate induced colitis model in the rat, rolipram and the selective PDE4 inhibitor LAS31025 have demonstrated beneficial effects comparable to prednisolone. Both test compounds have been shown to ameliorate bleeding and inflammatory markers. See Puig et al. \u201cCurative effects of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors in dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis in the rat,\u201d <i>Gastroenterology </i>114(4) A1064, 1998. Other workers have used additional models to demonstrate the ability of selective PDE4 inhibitors to provide gastrointestinal protection. For example, it has been shown that lipopolysaccharide induced erythrocyte extravasation in rats and intestinal hypoperfusion in dogs can be attenuated with the selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram and denbufylline. See Cardelus et al., \u201cInhibiting LPS induced bowel erythrocyte extravasation in rats, and of mesenteric hypoperfusion in dogs, by phosphodiesterase inhibitors,\u201d <i>Eur. J.

Septic shock is deemed to result from the action of endotoxins or other products of the infectious agent on the vascular system, causing large volumes of blood to be sequestered in the capillaries and veins. Activation of the complement and kinin systems and the release of histamine, cytokines, prostaglandins, and other mediators is also involved. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0525\" num=\"0525\">[0525] It has been shown in a model of endotoxin-induced acute renal failure in rats that the selective PDE4 inhibitor, Ro-201724, given as a post-treatment at 10 \u03bcg/kg/min significantly increases urinary cAMP excretion, markedly attenuates endotoxin-induced increases in renal vascular resistance and decreases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Ro-201724 has also been shown to improve survival rates for endotoxin-treated rats. See Carcillo et al., <i>Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </i>279 1197, 1996. Pentoxifylline has also been studied in patients suffering from septic shock. In this study twenty-four individuals fulfilling the criteria for septic shock have been selected, twelve of which have received pentoxifylline at 1 mg/kg/hr over a 24-Hour period, while the other twelve have served as a control group. After 24 hours it has been found that the TNF-\u03b1 levels in the therapy group have been significantly lowered, while the IL-6 levels have been significantly increased. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0526\" num=\"0526\">[0526] In another study, it has been shown that pretreatment with pentoxifylline at 5 to 50 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, or with the selective PDE4 inhibitors rolipram at 10 to 30 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, and debufylline at 0.1 to 3 mg/kg i.p. 3\u00d7, reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced bowel erythrocyte extravasation in rats, and that denbufylline is 100-fold more potent than pentoxifylline in inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced mesenteric blood flow fall, without affecting renal blood flow or cardiac index. See Cardelus et al., Ibid., <i>Eur. J. Pharmacol. </i> </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0527\" num=\"0527\">[0527] Renal failure is the inability of the kidney to excrete metabolites at normal plasma levels under conditions of normal loading, or the inability to retain electrolytes under conditions of normal intake. In the acute form, it is marked by uremia and usually by oliguria or anuria, with hyperkalemia and pulmonary edema. On the basis of the above-described activities of selective PDE4 inhibitors, it has been demonstrated that selective PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the treatment of renal failure, especially acute renal failure. See Begany et al., \u201cInhibition of Type IV phosphodiesterase by Ro-20-1724 attenuates endotoxin-induced acute renal failure,\u201d <i>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Thera. </i>278 37-41, 1996.

Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of renal failure, particularly acute renal failure. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0528\" num=\"0528\">[0528] Cachexia is a profound and marked state of constitutional disorder characterized by general ill health and malnutrition. Cachexia may be the end result of a number of causative factors, e.g., it may result from infection by any one of a number of different unicellular organisms or microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans. Malarial cachexia is representative and comprises a group of signs of a chronic nature that result from antecedent attacks of severe malaria, the principal signs being anemia, sallow skin, yellow sclera, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. Another cause of cachexia is the deprivation or deterioration of humoral or other organic functions, e.g., hypophysial cachexia comprises a train of symptoms resulting from total deprivation of function of the pituitary gland, including phthisis, loss of sexual function, atrophy of the pituitary target glands, bradycardia, hypothermia, apathy, and coma. Uremic cachexia is cachexia associated with other systemic symptoms of advanced renal failure. Cardiac cachexia comprises the emaciation due to heart disease. Cachexia suprarenalis, or Addison&#39;s disease, is a disorder characterized by hypotension, weight loss, anorexia, and weakness, caused by adrenocortical hormone deficiency. It is due to tuberculosis- or autoimmune-induced destruction of the adrenal cortex that results in deficiency of aldosterone and cortisol. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0529\" num=\"0529\">[0529] Cachexia may also be the result of disease states of various types. Cancerous cachexia comprises the weak, emaciated condition seen in cases of malignant tumor. Cachexia can also be a consequence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and comprises the symptoms commonly referred to as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in treating cachexia of the different types described above as a result of their ability to provide down-regulation or inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release. The selective PDE4 inhibitors of the present invention have a marked effect on the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells after those cells have been stimulated with a wide range of mediators. TNF-\u03b1 release is implicated or plays a mediating role in diseases or conditions whose etiology involves or comprises morbid, i.e., unhealthy, excessive or unregulated TNF-\u03b1 release. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0530\" num=\"0530\">[0530] The PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of infection, especially infection by viruses wherein such viruses increase the production of TNF-\u03b1 in their host, or wherein such viruses are sensitive to upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 in their host so that their replication or other vital activities are adversely impacted. Such viruses include, e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-3; cytomegalovirus, CMV; influenza; adenoviruses; and Herpes viruses, especially Herpes zoster and Herpes simplex. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0531\" num=\"0531\">[0531] The PDE4 inhibitory compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are further useful in the treatment of yeast and fungus infections wherein said yeast and fungi are sensitive to upregulation by TNF-\u03b1 or elicit TNF-\u03b1 production in their host. A particular disease which is treatable in this way is fungal meningitis. The compounds of Formula (1.0.0) also provide beneficial effects when combined with, i.e., administered in conjunction with other drugs of choice for the treatment of systemic yeast and fungus infections. Such drugs of choice include, but are not limited to polymixins, e.g., Polymycin B; imidazoles, e.g., clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, and ketoconazole; triazoles, e.g., fluconazole and itranazole; and amphotericins, e.g., Amphotericin B and liposomal Amphotericin B. The term \u201cco-administration\u201d as used herein with reference to the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) and drugs of choice for the treatment of systemic yeast and fungus infections, is intended to mean and include (a) simultaneous administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated together into a single dosage form; (b) substantially simultaneous administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms; and (c) sequential administration of such compound(s) and drug(s) to a subject when formulated apart from each other and administered consecutively with some significant time interval between. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0532\" num=\"0532\">[0532] 8.12 Liver Injury </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0533\" num=\"0533\">[0533] In addition to the above-described adverse effects of TNF-\u03b1, it also causes hepatic failure in humans, a phenomenon which has been shown in a number of animal models. For example, in an acute model of T-cell mediated hepatic failure, rolipram administered at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p. 30 minutes before challenge with either concanavalin A or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, has been shown to significantly reduce plasma TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3 concentrations, whereas it also significantly elevates IL-10 levels. See Gantner et al., <i>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </i>280 53, 1997. In this same study, rolipram has also been shown to suppress concanavalin A-induced IL-4 release. The plasma activities of the liver specific enzymes ALT, AST, and SDH have also been assessed in this study, since any increase in their levels would indicate massive liver cell destruction. It has been found that in pretreatment of na\u00efve mice receiving concanavalin A, or galactosamine-sensitized mice receiving galactosaminelstaphylococcal enterotoxin B, with rolipram at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p., that rolipram has dose-dependently inhibited the above-mentioned plasma enzyme activities. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of T-cell disorders such as liver failure. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0534\" num=\"0534\">[0534] 8.13 Pulmonary Hypertension </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0535\" num=\"0535\">[0535] It is known that the activity of phosphodiesterases, which hydrolyze the vasodilatory second messengers cAMP and cGMP, may be increased by hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Hypoxia is a reduction of oxygen supply to tissue below physiological levels despite adequate perfusion of the tissue by blood. The resulting pulmonary hypertension is characterized by increased pressure, i.e., above 30 mm Hg systolic and above 12 mm. Hg diastolic, within the pulmonary arterial circulation. Using a model which utilizes isolated pulmonary artery rings from normal rats and from rats with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, it has been shown that the selective PDE4 inhibitor rolipram potentiates the relaxant activities of isoproterenol and forskolin. The same effect has been observed with milrinone, which is a selective PDE3 inhibitor, thereby supporting inhibition of both PDE3 and PDE4 in order to significantly improve pulmonary artery relaxation in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. See Wagner et al., <i>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </i>282 1650, 1997. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are useful in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, especially hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0536\" num=\"0536\">[0536] 8.14 Bone Loss Disease </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0537\" num=\"0537\">[0537] Bone loss disease, more commonly referred to as osteoporosis, is a condition of low bone mass and microarchitectural disruption that results in fractures with minimal trauma. Secondary osteoporosis is due to systemic illness or medications such as glucocorticoids. Primary osteoporosis, it has been contended, should be viewed as comprising two conditions: Type I osteoporosis which is loss of trabecular bone due to estrogen deficiency at menopause, and Type II osteoporosis which is loss of cortical and trabecular bone due to long-term remodeling inefficiency, dietary inadequacy, and activation of the parathyroid axis with age. The primary regulators of adult bone mass include physical activity, reproductive endocrine status, and calcium intake, and optimal maintenance of bone requires sufficiency in all three areas. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0538\" num=\"0538\">[0538] It has been demonstrated that selective PDE4 inhibitors are useful in the beneficial treatment of bone loss disease, particularly osteoporosis. The effect of denbufylline on bone loss in Walker 256/S-bearing rats and on mineralized nodule formation and osteoclast-like cell formation has been studied in bone marrow culture systems. It has been discovered that serial oral administrations of denbufylline inhibit the decrease in the bone mineral density of femurs from Walker 256/S-bearing rats, and restore the bone mass and the number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts per trabecular surface in the femur metaphysis. The administration of denbufylline has also been found to result in an increase in the number of mineralized nodules and a decrease in the number of osteoclast-like cells in the in vitro bone marrow culture system. These beneficial effects are specific for PDE4 inhibition and are mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP, demonstrating that the PDE4 isozyme plays an important role in bone turnover through cAMP.

Pharmacol. </i>54 613, 1997; Waki et al., \u201cEffects of XT-44, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in osteoblastgenesis and osteoclastgenesis in culture and its therapeutic effects in rat osteopenia models,\u201d <i>Jpn.

As already adverted to above, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is one of two groups of enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid, the other group being the cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2. The 5-lipoxygenase activating protein is an 18 kDa membrane-bound, arachidonate-binding protein which stimulates the conversion of cellular arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase. The arachidonic acid is converted into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), and this pathway eventually leads to the production of inflammatory leukotrienes; consequently, blocking the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein or the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme itself provides a desirable target for beneficially interfering with that pathway. One such 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor is zileuton represented by Formula (0.1.14), which may be found both above and following. Among the classes of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors which are useful for forming therapeutic combinations with the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) are the following: </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0578\" num=\"0578\">[0578] (a) redox-active agents which include N-hydroxyureas; N-alkylhydroxamic acids; selenite; hydroxybenzofurans; hydroxylamines; and catechols; see Ford-Hutchinson et al., \u201c5-Lipoxygenase,\u201d <i>Ann.

It should be understood, however, that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredient may also depend upon the therapeutic or prophylactic agent, if any, with which the ingredient is co-administered. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0674\" num=\"0674\">[0674] The above-described compounds of the present invention may be utilized in the form of acids, esters, or other chemical classes of compounds to which the compounds described belong. It is also within the scope of the present invention to utilize those compounds in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases in accordance with procedures described in detail above and well known in the art. An active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0) is often utilized in the form of a salt thereof, especially where said salt form confers on said active ingredient improved pharmacokinetic properties as compared to the free form of said active ingredient or some other salt form of said active ingredient utilized previously. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of said active ingredient may also initially confer a desirable pharmacokinetic property on said active ingredient which it did not previously possess, and may even positively affect the pharmacodynamics of said active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic activity in the body. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0675\" num=\"0675\">[0675] The pharmacokinetic properties of said active ingredient which may be favorably affected include, e.g., the manner in which said active ingredient is transported across cell membranes, which in turn may directly and positively affect the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of said active ingredient. While the route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is important, and various anatomical, physiological and pathological factors can critically affect bioavailability, the solubility of said active ingredient is usually dependent upon the character of the particular salt form thereof which it utilized. Further, as the artisan understands, an aqueous solution of said active ingredient will provide the most rapid absorption of said active ingredient into the body of a patient being treated, while lipid solutions and suspensions, as well as solid dosage forms, will result in less rapid absorption of said active ingredient. Oral ingestion of said active ingredient is the most preferred route of administration for reasons of safety, convenience, and economy, but absorption of such an oral dosage form can be adversely affected by physical characteristics such as polarity, emesis caused by irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosa, destruction by digestive enzymes and low pH, irregular absorption or propulsion in the presence of food or other drugs, and metabolism by enzymes of the mucosa, the intestinal flora, or the liver. Formulation of said active ingredient into different pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms may be effective in overcoming or alleviating one or more of the above-recited problems encountered with absorption of oral dosage forms. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0676\" num=\"0676\">[0676] Among the pharmaceutical salts recited further above, those which are preferred include, but are not limited to acetate, besylate, citrate, fumarate, gluconate, hemisuccinate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, isethionate, mandelate, meglumine, nitrate, oleate, phosphonate, pivalate, sodium phosphate, stearate, sulfate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, thiomalate, tosylate, and tromethamine. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0677\" num=\"0677\">[0677] Multiple salts forms are included within the scope of the present invention where a compound of the present invention contains more than one group capable of forming such pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

In these liquid pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient may be contained in solution as the solute. This is the most common and most preferred type of such composition, but requires an active ingredient in a salt form that has reasonably good aqueous solubility. Water (or saline) is by far the most preferred solvent for such compositions. Occasionally supersaturated solutions may be utilized, but these present stability problems that make them impractical for use on an everyday basis. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0713\" num=\"0713\">[0713] If it is not possible to obtain a form of some compound of Formula (1.0.0) that has the requisite degree of aqueous solubility, as may sometimes occur, it is within the skill of the artisan to prepare an emulsion, which is a dispersion of small globules of one liquid, the discontinuous or internal phase, throughout a second liquid, the continuous or external phase, with which it is immiscible. The two liquids are maintained in an emulsified state by the use of emulsifiers which are pharmaceutically acceptable. Thus, if the active ingredient is a water-insoluble oil, it can be administered in an emulsion of which it is the discontinuous phase. Also where the active ingredient is water-insoluble but can be dissolved in a solvent which is immiscible with water, an emulsion can be used. While the active ingredient would most commonly be used as the discontinuous or internal phase of what is referred to as an oil-in-water emulsion, it could also be used as the discontinuous or internal phase of an inverse emulsion, which is commonly referred to as a water-in-oil emulsion. Here the active ingredient is soluble in water and could be administered as a simple aqueous solution. However, inverse emulsions invert upon injection or infusion into an aqueous medium such as the blood, and offer the advantage of providing a more rapid and efficient dispersion of the active ingredient into that aqueous medium than can be obtained using an aqueous solution. Inverse emulsions are prepared by using suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agents well known in the art. Where the active ingredient has limited water solubility, it may also be administered as a suspended solid in colloidal or microparticulate form in a suspension prepared using suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agents. The suspended solids containing the active ingredient may also be formulated as delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release compositions. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0714\" num=\"0714\">[0714] While systemic administration will most frequently be carried out by injection or infusion of a liquid, there are many situations in which it will be advantageous or even necessary to deliver the active ingredient as a solid. Systemic administration of solids is carried out by instillation, inhalation or insufflation of a pharmaceutical composition in suitable solid form containing the active ingredient. Instillation of the active ingredient may entail installing a solid implant composition into suitable body tissues or cavities. The implant may comprise a matrix of bio-compatible and bio-erodible materials in which particles of a solid active ingredient are dispersed, or in which, possibly, globules or isolated cells of a liquid active ingredient are entrapped. Desirably, the matrix will be broken down and completely absorbed by the body. The composition of the matrix is also preferably selected to provide controlled-, sustained-, and/or delayed release of the active ingredient over extended periods of time, even as much as several months. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0715\" num=\"0715\">[0715] The term \u201cimplant\u201d most often denotes a solid pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient, while the term \u201cdepot\u201d usually implies a liquid pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient, which is deposited in any suitable body tissues or cavities to form a reservoir or pool which slowly migrates to surrounding tissues and organs and eventually becomes systemically distributed. However, these distinctions are not always rigidly adhered to in the art, and consequently, it is contemplated that there is included within the scope of the present invention liquid implants and solid depots, and even mixed solid and liquid forms for each. Suppositories may be regarded as a type of implant, since they comprise bases which are solid at room temperature but melt at a patient&#39;s body temperature, slowly releasing the active ingredient with which they are impregnated into the surrounding tissue of the patient&#39;s body, where the active ingredient becomes absorbed and transported to effect systemic administration. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0716\" num=\"0716\">[0716] Systemic administration can also be accomplished by inhalation or insufflation of a powder, i.e., particulate composition containing the active ingredient. For example, the active ingredient in powder form may be inhaled into the lungs using conventional devices for aerosolizing particulate formulations. The active ingredient as a particulate formulation may also be administered by insufflation, i.e., blown or otherwise dispersed into suitable body tissues or cavities by simple dusting or using conventional devices for aerosolizing particulate formulations. These particulate compositions may also be formulated to provide delayed-, sustained-, and/or controlled-release of the active ingredient in accordance with well understood principles and known materials. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0717\" num=\"0717\">[0717] Other means of systemic administration which may utilize the active ingredients of the present invention in either liquid or solid form include transdermal, intranasal, and opthalmic routes. In particular, transdermal patches prepared in accordance with well known drug delivery technology may be prepared and applied to the skin of a patient to be treated, whereafter the active agent by reason of its formulated solubility characteristics migrates across the epidermis and into the dermal layers of the patient&#39;s skin where it is taken up as part of the general circulation of the patient, ultimately providing systemic distribution of the active ingredient over a desired, extended period of time. Also included are implants which are placed beneath the epidermal layer of the skin, i.e. between the epidermis and the dermis of the skin of the patient being treated. Such an implant will be formulated in accordance with well known principles and materials commonly used in this delivery technology, and may be prepared in such a way as to provide controlled-, sustained-, and/or delayed-release of the active ingredient into the systemic circulation of the patient. Such subepidermal (subcuticular) implants provide the same facility of installation and delivery efficiency as transdermal patches, but without the limitation of being subject to degradation, damage or accidental removal as a consequence of being exposed on the top layer of the patient&#39;s skin. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0718\" num=\"0718\">[0718] In the above description of pharmaceutical compositions containing an active ingredient of Formula (1.0.0), the equivalent expressions: \u201cadministration\u201d, \u201cadministration of\u201d, \u201cadministering\u201d, and \u201cadministering a\u201d have been used with respect to said pharmaceutical compositions. As thus employed, these expressions are intended to mean providing to a patient in need of treatment a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention by any of the routes of administration herein described, wherein the active ingredient is a compound of Formula (1.0.0) or a prodrug, derivative, or metabolite thereof which is useful in treating a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by or associated with modulation of PDE4, especially PDE4D activity in said patient. Accordingly, there is included within the scope of the present invention any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of directly or indirectly providing a compound of Formula (1.0.0). Such compounds are recognized as prodrugs, and a number of established procedures are available for preparing such prodrug forms of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0). </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0719\" num=\"0719\">[0719] The dosage and dose rate of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) effective for treating or preventing a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by or associated with modulation of PDE4, especially PDE4D activity, will depend on a variety of factors, such as the nature of the inhibitor, the size of the patient, the goal of the treatment, the nature of the pathology to be treated, the specific pharmaceutical composition used, and the observations and conclusions of the treating physician. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0720\" num=\"0720\">[0720] For example, where the dosage form is oral, e.g., a tablet or capsule, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 0.1 \u03bcg/kg and about 50.0 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 5.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 5.0 mg/kg body weight per day, more preferably between about 10.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 1.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 20.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.5 mg/kg of body weight per day of the active ingredient. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0721\" num=\"0721\">[0721] Where the dosage form is topically administered to the bronchia and lungs, e.g., by means of a powder inhaler or nebulizer, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 0.001 \u03bcg/kg and about 10.0 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day, more preferably between about 1.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 2.0 \u03bcg/kg and about 0.05 mg/kg of body weight per day of the active ingredient. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0722\" num=\"0722\">[0722] Using representative body weights of 10 kg and 100 kg in order to illustrate the range of daily aerosolized topical dosages which might be used as described above, suitable dosage levels of the compounds of Formula (1.0.0) will be between about 1.0-10.0 kg and 500.0-5000.0 mg per day, preferably between about 5.0-50.0 \u03bcg and 5.0-50.0 mg per day, more preferably between about 100.0-1000.0 \u03bcg and 10.0-100.0 mg per day, and most preferably between about 200.0-2000.0 \u03bcg and about 5.0-50.0 mg per day of the active ingredient comprising a compound of Formula (1.0.0). These ranges of dosage amounts represent total dosage amounts of the active ingredient per day for a given patient. The number of times per day that a dose is administered will depend upon such pharmacological and pharmacokinetic factors as the half-life of the active ingredient, which reflects its rate of catabolism and clearance, as well as the minimal and optimal blood plasma or other body fluid levels of said active ingredient attained in the patient which are required for therapeutic efficacy. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0723\" num=\"0723\">[0723] Numerous other factors must also be considered in deciding upon the number of doses per day and the amount of active ingredient per dose that will be administered. Not the least important of such other factors is the individual respsonse of the patient being treated. Thus, for example, where the active ingredient is used to treat or prevent asthma, and is administered topically via aerosol inhalation into the lungs, from one to four doses consisting of acuations of a dispensing device, i.e., \u201cpuffs\u201d of an inhaler, will be administered each day, each dose containing from about 50.0 \u03bcg to about 10.0 mg of active ingredient. </p>\\n      <heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0724\" num=\"0724\">[0724] 11.0 Preparations and Working Examples </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0725\" num=\"0725\">[0725] There follows a description of numerous Preparations by which intermediates used in preparing specific compounds of Formula (1.0.0) were made.

No. 09/927,648, filed on Aug. 13, 2001, and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/961,278 filed on Sep. 25, 2001, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0002] The present invention is directed generally to semiconductor devices and methods of fabrication and more particularly to a thin film transistor (TFT) mask ROM and method of fabrication.  \\n       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0003] Thin film transistors (TFTs) are utilized in various devices, such as a liquid crystal displays, static random access memories and in nonvolatile memories. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,572,046 and 5,383,149 also suggest using TFTs in a mask read only memory (mask ROM or MROM). Conventional TFTs have a structure that is similar to conventional bulk metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), except that TFTs are formed in a semiconductor layer that is located above an insulating substrate, such as a glass substrate, or above a semiconductor substrate that is covered by an insulating layer.  \\n       [0004] The mask ROM derives its name from the fact that this nonvolatile memory is programmed or written using a custom mask during fabrication. In a conventional mask ROM fabrication process, a semi-finished array of transistors is covered by a photoresist layer. This photoresist layer is patterned using the custom photolithography mask to expose the channel regions of a first set of transistors while covering the channel regions of a second set of transistors of the array. The exposed channel regions are then rendered non-conductive by implanting the exposed channel regions of a first conductivity type with ions of the same conductivity type in order to raise the threshold voltage of the implanted transistors. Thus, the mask ROM array contains a first set of enabled transistors and a second set of disabled transistors.  \\n       [0005] Each bit of information in a mask ROM is stored by the presence or absence of a data path from a word (access) line to a bit (sense) line. The data path is eliminated by ensuring that no operational circuit element (i.e., transistor) joins a word and a bit line, such as by increasing the threshold voltage of selected transistors by the selective ion implantation. When a word line of a mask ROM is activated, the presence of a signal on the bit line will mean that a \u201c1\u201d is stored, whereas the absence of a signal will indicate that the bit location is storing a \u201c0\u201d, as discussed on pages 619-621 of S. Wolf,  Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Vol.  2, Lattice Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference. Mask ROM arrays may be implemented as NOR or NAND arrays, for example.  \\n       [0006] The state of the art mask ROM has an effective cell area of 4F 2 , where F is the minimum feature size. This cell area is larger than desirable, and leads to a less than optimum cell density, which increases the cost of the mask ROM.  \\n       BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  \\n       [0007] A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array, comprising a plurality of device levels, wherein each device level comprises a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs.  \\n       [0008] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a TFT mask ROM array, comprising (a) a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails disposed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction and (b) a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction. Each rail stack includes (i) a first semiconductor layer whose first surface is in contact with said first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails, (ii) a conductive film, and (iii) a gate insulating film disposed between a second surface of the first semiconductor layer and the conductive film. The TFTs are formed at intersections of two adjacent first rails and the second rail stack. The TFTs comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs.  \\n       [0009] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a mask ROM array, comprising a first set of enabled transistors containing a charge storage region, and a second set of partially or totally disabled transistors.  \\n       [0010] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method of making monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array, comprising forming a first device level comprising a plurality of TFTs over a substrate, forming a first mask over the first device level, and partially or totally disabling a first set of TFTs in the first device level. The method also comprises forming a second device level comprising a plurality of TFTs over the first device level, forming a second mask over the second device level, and partially or totally disabling a second set of TFTs in the second device level.  \\n       [0011] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method of making a TFT mask ROM array, comprising forming a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails disposed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction, forming a first semiconductor layer whose first surface is in contact with said first plurality of spaced apart conductors and forming a first mask over the first semiconductor layer. The method also comprises selectively etching unmasked portions of the first semiconductor layer or selectively implanting ions into unmasked portions of the first semiconductor layer, forming a conductive film, and forming a gate insulating film disposed between a second surface of the first semiconductor layer and the conductive film. The method also comprises forming a second mask, and patterning the first semiconductor layer, the gate insulating film and the conductive film to form a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction.  \\n       [0012] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method of making a mask ROM array, comprising forming an array of transistors containing a charge storage region, forming a mask over the array, and selectively totally or partially disabling unmasked transistors. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS  \\n     [0013]FIGS. 1, 3 and  5 A and  5 B are side cross sectional views of arrays according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention.  \\n     [0014]FIG. 2 is a three dimensional view of an array according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.  \\n     [0015] FIGS.  4 A-D are side cross sectional view of a preferred method of making the array of FIG. 1.  \\n     [0016] FIGS.  6 - 8  are circuit schematics of an array according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.  \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  \\n     [0017] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, mask ROM density is increased and its cost is decreased by forming a the mask ROM as a monolithic three dimensional array of TFTs. By integrating the array in three dimensions, the effective cell area of the array is reduced to 4F 2 /N, where F is the minimum feature size and N is the number of device levels in the array.  \\n     [0018]FIG. 1 illustrates a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array  1  according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The array comprises a plurality of device levels  2  separated by interlevel insulating layers  3 . There may be two or more device levels, such as four to eight device levels  2 , separated by one or more interlevel insulating layers  3 , such as three to seven insulating layers  3 . The device levels  2  alternate with interlevel insulating layers  3 . The array  1  is preferably formed over a substrate  4 .  \\n     [0019] Each device level  2  contains a first set of enabled TFTs  5  and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs  6 . In one preferred aspect of the invention, the term \u201ctotally disabled\u201d means that a particular TFT is rendered permanently off for any input voltage. In another preferred aspect of the invention, the term \u201cpartially disabled\u201d means either that a threshold voltage of a particular TFT has been increased such that this TFT is in the off state for a particular value of input voltage that would be sufficient to turn an enabled TFT on and/or that a sense current of this TFT is lower than that of an enabled TFT. However, a partially disabled TFT may be turned on by providing an input voltage higher than the input voltage sufficient to turn the enabled TFT on.  \\n     [0020] In one preferred aspect of the invention, the second set of TFTs  6  comprises only totally disabled TFTs. In another preferred aspect of the invention, the second set of TFTs  6  contains both totally and partially disabled TFTs. Thus, a so-called \u201cmultilevel\u201d mask ROM array  1  is formed if the array contains partially disabled TFTs. An example of a conventional multilevel mask ROM is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,029, incorporated herein by reference. In a multilevel mask ROM, multiple levels of conduction current may be sensed when the ROM array is accessed, since a different amount of conduction current is sensed from bit lines of the enabled and the partially disabled TFTs. Of course, the second set of TFTs  6  may only contain partially disabled TFTs if desired.  \\n     [0021] It should be noted the array  1  may contain optional additional device levels (not shown in FIG. 1) which contain only enabled TFTs  5  or only disabled TFTs  6 . Furthermore, the optional additional device levels may contain devices other than TFTs and be used for circuits other than the mask ROM. For example, peripheral or driver circuits may be formed in the substrate  4  or in one or more array  1  device levels  2 .  \\n     [0022] A TFT may be disabled by any means that prevents or restricts a flow of data (i.e,, current) between the word line and the bit line contacting the TFT. For example, the TFTs of the second set  6  may be disabled by removing at least a portion of channel regions of these TFTs using a mask, such as a photoresist mask, to render these TFTs totally inoperative. Alternatively, the TFTs of the second set  6  may be disabled by selectively doping channel regions of these TFTs using a mask to increase the threshold voltage of these TFTs above a predetermined amount to render said TFTs partially or totally inoperative. Furthermore, the TFTs of the second set  6  may be totally disabled by removing (i.e., etching) unmasked contacts between a word line or a bit line and the TFTs. For example, a gate electrode, source or drain electrodes and/or source or drain regions may be removed to disable the TFT.  \\n     [0023] For example, in one preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of channel regions of a first subset  7  of the TFTs of the second set  6  have been selectively removed to render the first subset  7  of the TFTs totally disabled, as shown in FIG. 1. The channel regions of a second subset  8  of the TFTs of the second set  6  have been selectively doped to increase a threshold voltage of said TFTs to render said TFTs partially disabled to form a multilevel mask ROM, as shown in FIG. 1. The first  7  and the second  8  subsets are disabled using different masks.  \\n     [0024] In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the first subset of TFTs  7  may be rendered totally disabled by a first threshold voltage adjustment implant, while the second subset of TFTs  8  may be rendered partially disabled by a lower concentration threshold voltage adjustment implant. Preferably, the first and the second implants are carried out at the same time through the same photoresist mask using the same dose of implanted ions. The photoresist mask fully covers the channel regions of the enabled TFTs, partially covers the channel regions of the partially disabled TFTs, and does not cover the channel regions of the fully disabled TFTs. The difference in mask coverage results in a different concentration of ions being implanted into the TFT channel regions.  \\n     [0025] The TFTs  5  and  6  may comprise any type of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) TFTs, such as top gate co-planar TFTs, top gate staggered TFTs, bottom gate co-planar TFTs and/or bottom gate staggered TFTs. In co-planar TFTs, the source/drain electrodes and the gate electrode are on the same side of the channel. In staggered TFTs, the source/drain electrodes and the gate electrode are on the opposite sides of the channel. The array  1  may comprise one type of TFTs or more than one type of TFTs. Furthermore, TFTs may comprise bipolar TFTs, if desired.  \\n     [0026] In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mask ROM array is provided in a \u201crail stack\u201d staggered TFT configuration. FIG. 2 illustrates one preferred configuration of an array  10  of top gate staggered rail stack TFTs. The array  10  includes a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails  11  disposed at a first height above a substrate (not shown for clarity) in a first direction. The array also includes a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks  12  disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction. Each rail stack includes a first semiconductor layer  13  whose first surface  15  is in contact with the first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails  11 . Each rail stack  12  also includes a conductive film  17  and a gate insulating film  16  disposed between a second surface  18  of the first semiconductor layer  13  and the conductive film  17 . Each TFT cell  19  is formed at the intersection of two adjacent first rails  11  and one second rail stack  12 . The TFT  19  channel length is determined by the space between the adjacent rails  11 , and its channel width is determined by the width of the second rail stack  12 . The TFTs  19  comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1.  \\n     [0027] The first plurality of rails  11  preferably comprise heavily doped polysilicon layers  21  of a first conductivity type (i.e., N+ or P+) in contact with metal or a metal silicide layers  22 . The metal or metal silicide layers  22  are preferably formed buried within the rails  11 , but may also be formed on the sides and/or bottom of the rails  11 . The metal may comprise aluminum, copper, tungsten or titanium (including titanium nitride). The metal silicide may comprise any silicide, such as titanium, tungsten, cobalt, platinum or nickel silicide.  \\n     [0028] The first semiconductor layer  13  preferably comprises a polysilicon layer of a second conductivity type (i.e., P\u2212 or N\u2212). However, an amorphous silicon layer may be used instead. The substrate may be a silicon or other semiconductor substrate with an overlying interlevel insulating layer. Alternatively, the substrate may comprise an insulating material, such as glass, quartz, ceramic or plastic. The conductive film  17  preferably comprises a polysilicon layer  23  and a metal silicide layer  24 . As used herein, a \u201cfilm\u201d may contain one or more \u201clayers\u201d.  \\n     [0029] The gate insulating film  16  may comprise a silicon oxide or a silicon nitride layer or any other one or more insulating layers. In one preferred embodiment, film  16  comprises a portion of a charge storage region. Preferably, film  16  comprises a portion of a charge storage region, when it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM) together in the same array of transistors, as will be described in more detail below with respect to FIGS.  6 - 9 . The charge storage region may comprises a dielectric isolated floating gate (i.e., a polysilicon floating gate located between a tunnel dielectric and a control gate dielectric), an ONO dielectric film (i.e., a stack of silicon oxide/silicon nitride or oxynitridelsilicon oxide layers) or an insulating layer containing conductive nanocrystals. The ONO dielectric film comprises a tunnel oxide, a charge storage Si 3 N 4-x O 1.5x  layer, where x is 0 to 1, and a blocking oxide. The tunnel oxide has a thickness of 1.5 nm to 7 nm, preferably 2.5 nm. The charge storage silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride (Si 3 N 4-x O 1.5x ) layer has a thickness of at least 4 nm, preferably 4-15 nm, most preferably 5 nm. The blocking oxide layer has a thickness of 3 nm to 9 nm, preferably 4.0 nm. The insulating layer containing the conductive nanocrystals may comprise silicon, tungsten or aluminum nanocrystals dispersed in a silicon oxide, nitride or oxynitride insulating layer.  \\n     [0030] The polysilicon layers  21  of the first rails  11  comprise at least a portion of the TFT  19  source and drain regions. The conductive film  17  comprises a gate of the TFTs. Portions of the first semiconductor layer  13  comprise TFT channel regions of a second conductivity type. If desired, optional doped regions  25  of a first conductivity type may be outdiffused from layers  21  into the first semiconductor layer  13 . Thus, optional regions  25  and layers  21  comprise the TFT  19  source and drain regions, while the metal or metal silicide layers  22  comprise the source and drain electrodes. Alternatively, regions  25  may be omitted and layers  21  may comprise the entire source and drain regions of the TFTs  19 . Furthermore, if desired, intrinsic or lightly doped polysilicon layers of the first conductivity type may be formed in the first rails  11  between the heavily doped layers  21  and the first semiconductor layer  13  to form offset or low doped drain (LDD) layers.  \\n     [0031] Preferably, a first planarized insulating layer  26 , such as silicon oxide, is located between the first rails  11 , and a second planarized insulating layer  27 , such as silicon oxide, is located between the second rail stacks  12  (layers  26  and  27  are shown by dashed lines in FIG. 2 for clarity). Alternatively, one or more of silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, spin-on glass, BPSG, PSG or BSG may be used instead of or in addition to silicon oxide. Layers  26  and  27  may be planarized by chemical mechanical polishing or by other planarization methods.  \\n     [0032] In FIG. 2, the first rails  11  are located below the second rail stacks  12  to form an array  10  of top gate staggered TFTs (i.e., the gate  17  is formed above the channel  13  on the opposite side of the source and drain regions  21 ). Alternatively, the first rails  11  may be located above the second rail stacks  12  (i.e., layers  13 ,  16  and  17 ) to form an array  20  of bottom gate staggered TFTs, as shown in FIG. 3. If desired, the arrays  10  or  20  may be formed in a monolithic three dimensional array. In this case, the array comprises a plurality of device levels  2 A- 2 C, each containing an array  10  or  20 , separated by interlevel insulating layers  3 A- 3 D, similar to the array shown in FIG. 1. However, since the rail stack arrays  10  or  20  have a high density, these arrays may comprise only one device level, if desired.  \\n     [0033] The mask ROM arrays of the preferred embodiments described above may be made by any method. A preferred method of making a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array includes the following steps shown in FIGS.  4 A-D. A first device level  2 A comprising a plurality of TFT channel regions is provided over a substrate  4 . The first device level  2 A contains a semiconductor layer  9 A that will used to form TFT channel regions. Preferably, layer  9 A is formed over an insulating layer  3 A, which is formed over the substrate  4 , as shown in FIG. 4A.  \\n     [0034] A first mask  31 , such as a photoresist mask, is formed over the semiconductor layer  9 A. Mask  31  covers all of layer  9 A where the channel regions of the first set of TFTs  5  will be formed, except region(s)  33 , where the channel regions of the second set of TFTs  6  will be formed, as shown in FIG. 4A. A second set of TFTs  6  in the first device level  2 A is then totally or partially disabled by selective etching or ion implanting the unmasked channel regions  33  of the second set of TFTs  6 . For example, selective ion implanting is schematically shown in FIG. 4A by arrows and the \u201cxx\u201d symbol.  \\n     [0035] The TFTs  5  and  6  of the array are then completed by forming a gate insulating layer on the channels, gate electrodes on the gate insulating layer, source and drain regions, and any other required layers for a functional TFT, as shown in FIG. 4B. Alternatively, the step of forming a mask  31  and the step of disabling the TFTs  6  by etching or ion implantation may be carried out after the first and the second sets of TFTs  5  and  6  have been completed. Thus, the ion implantation may be carried out through the gate electrode into the channel. Likewise, the selective etching may be used to remove the gate electrode in addition to or instead of removing the channel.  \\n     [0036] A first interlevel insulating layer  3 B is then formed over the first device level  2 A, as shown in FIG. 4B. Layer  3 B may comprise one or more of silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, spin-on glass, BPSG, PSG, BSG or any other insulating layers. The first interlevel insulating layer  3 B is preferably planarized by chemical mechanical polishing or etchback.  \\n     [0037] A second device level  2 B comprising a plurality of TFT channel regions is formed over the first interlevel insulating layer  3 B, as shown in FIG. 4C. The second device level  2 B contains a semiconductor layer  9 B that will used to form TFT channel regions. A second mask  35 , such as a photoresist mask, is formed over the semiconductor layer  9 B, such that it covers all of layer  9 B where the channel regions of the first set of TFTs  5  will be formed, except region(s)  37 , where the channel regions of the second set of TFTs  6  will be formed, as shown in FIG. 4C.  \\n     [0038] A second set of TFTs  6  in the second device level  2 B are then totally or partially disabled by selective etching or ion implanting the unmasked channel regions  37  of the second set of TFTs  6 . The TFTs  5  and  6  of the array are then completed by forming a gate insulating layer on the channels, gate electrodes on the gate insulating layer, source and drain regions, and any other required layers for a functional TFT, as shown in FIG. 4D. If desired, a second interlevel insulating layer  3 C is formed over the second device level  2 B.  \\n     [0039] Thus, a three dimensional monolithic array is formed. Of course, the array may contain more than two device layers  2 A,  2 B, such as four to eight device layers. To form additional device layers, a plurality of interlevel insulating layers are formed. A plurality of device levels comprising a plurality of TFTs are formed over the plurality of interlevel insulating layers (i.e., each interlevel insulating layer is formed between adjacent device layers). A mask is formed over each of the plurality of device levels, and a second set of TFTs in the plurality of device levels is partially or totally disabled.  \\n     [0040] The term \u201cmonolithic\u201d, as used above, means that layers of each level of the array were directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. Thus, a first array of transistors is formed in a first semiconductor layer. Then, an interlayer insulating layer is formed over the first array of transistors. A second semiconductor layer is formed over the second interlayer insulating layer. A second array of transistors is formed in the second semiconductor layer to form a monolithic three dimensional array. Additional array levels may be formed in the same fashion if desired. In contrast, two dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a nonmonolithic memory device.  \\n     [0041] A similar method may be used to form an array of rail stack TFTs shown in FIGS.  2  or  3 . To form the array  10  of top gated TFTs shown in FIG. 2, a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails  11  are formed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction. Then, a first semiconductor layer  13  is formed such that its first surface  15  is in contact with said first plurality of spaced apart conductors  11 .  \\n     [0042] A first mask  31  is formed over the first semiconductor layer  13 , similar to that shown in FIG. 4A. The unmasked portions of layer  13  are selectively etched or ion implanted, similar to that shown in FIG. 4A. Thereafter, the gate insulating film  16  and conductive film  17  are formed over the etched or implanted first semiconductor layer  13 . Then, a second photoresist mask (not shown) is formed over the conductive film  17 . The first semiconductor layer  13 , the gate insulating film  16  and the conductive film  17  are then patterned (i.e., etched) using the second mask to form a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks  12 . The rail stacks are disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction, as shown in FIG. 2.  \\n     [0043] To form the array  20  of bottom gated TFTs of FIG. 3, the order of steps is reversed. The conductive film  17  and the gate insulating film  16  and the first semiconductor film  13  are formed in this order. Then, the first mask  31  is formed over layer  13  and the selective etching or ion implantation of layer  13  is performed. Then, the films  17  and  16  and layer  13  are patterned to form the second rail stacks  12 . If desired, the rail stacks  12  may be formed before forming the first mask  31  on layer  13 . Then, the first rails  11  are formed on the second rail stacks  12 , as shown in FIG. 3. If desired, the arrays  10  and  20  may be included in a monolithic three dimensional array by forming an interlevel insulating layer over each array and forming another array  10  or  20  over the interlayer insulating layer, as many times as desired.  \\n     [0044]FIGS. 1, 2 and  4 A-D illustrate a monolithic three dimensional array where adjacent device levels are separated by an interlevel insulating layer. However, in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, some or all interlevel insulating layers are omitted and at least two adjacent device levels in a monolithic three dimensional array contact each other, as shown in FIG. 5A. The exemplary array  30  illustrated in FIG. 5A contains four device levels  2 A- 2 D. Of course, there may be more or less than four device levels. The array  30  is similar to arrays  10  or  20 , except that layers of the array  30  are copied in a mirror image fashion in the vertical direction. The layers in FIG. 5A are numbered in the same fashion as in FIGS. 2 and 3, except that the layers have a suffix, such as \u201cA\u201d through \u201cD\u201d, depending on which device level  2 A-D contains the particular device layer.  \\n     [0045] In the layout of FIG. 5A, rails  11  A are shared between adjacent device levels  2 A and  2 B, while rails  11  B are shared between adjacent device levels  2 C and  2 D. Likewise, the conductive layer (i.e., gate electrode)  17 B of rail stack  12 B is shared between adjacent device levels  2 B and  2 C. Thus, adjacent device level pairs  2 A/ 2 B,  2 B/ 2 C and  2 C/ 2 D contact each other. However, each device level  2 A-D contains its own channel layer  13 A-D and its own gate insulating layer  16 A-D, which are not shared with adjacent device levels. Thus, each rail stack that is shared between device levels contains a conductive layer  17  between two gate insulating layers  16  and two channel layers  13 . Device levels  2 A and  2 C contain bottom gated TFTs, while device levels  2 B and  2 D contain top gated TFTs. The array  30  may contain n-type or p-type TFTs, as desired. The TFTs of array  30  comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1.  \\n     [0046]FIGS. 2, 3 and  5 A illustrate an array of n-type TFTs (i.e., NMOS) or p-type TFTs (i.e., PMOS) according to the preferred embodiments of the invention. FIG. 5B illustrates one device level of a vertically stacked, common gate CMOS mask ROM array in a rail stack configuration according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The CMOS array in FIG. 5B is similar to the arrays illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3 or  5 A except that transistors of different charge carrier type are formed on either side of the gate line. In FIG. 5B, the NMOS transistors are arranged below the PMOS transistors. However, it should be understood that the PMOS transistors may be arranged below the NMOS transistors if desired.  \\n     [0047] In FIG. 5B, the array of CMOS devices  100  is preferably formed over a planarized interlayer insulating layer  101 , such as a CMP planarized silicon oxide layer. Layer  101  is formed over a substrate (not shown) as in the previous embodiments. Each CMOS device is thus a CMOS TFT because it is formed over an insulating layer. However, the CMOS devices may be formed in a monocrystalline silicon substrate, if desired.  \\n     [0048] The array includes a plurality of gate lines (i.e., word lines)  103  (only one gate line is shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 5B). Preferably the gate line comprises a first N+ polysilicon layer  105 , a silicide layer  107 , such as a TiSi x  or WSi x  layer, over the first polysilicon layer and a second P+ polysilicon layer  109  above the silicide layer. The gate line  103  acts as a gate electrode in each TFT. Thus, no separate gate electrodes connected to the gate lines are required.  \\n     [0049] A first insulating layer  111  is disposed adjacent to a first side of the gate electrode  103 . This insulating layer  111  may be a conventional gate dielectric. If it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM in the same array of transistors, then the insulating layer  111  is preferably a charge storage layer, such as an ONO stack or isolated nanocrystals, to form charge storage CMOS TFTs, such as EEPROM CMOS TFTs. If floating gate type EEPROM CMOS TFTs are desired, then a floating gate and a control gate dielectric may be added between the insulating layer  111  and the gate line  103 .  \\n     [0050] A p-type semiconductor layer  113 , such as a P\u2212 polysilicon layer, is disposed on a side of the first insulating layer opposite to the gate  103 . This layer contains the NMOS TFT bodies. N+ source and drain regions  115  are disposed in layer  113 . The portions of layer  113  between regions  115  comprise NMOS TFT channel regions.  \\n     [0051] Preferably, the source and drain regions  115  are formed by outdiffusion of n-type dopants from the source and drain electrodes (i.e., bit lines)  117 . However, regions  115  may be formed by any other method, such as by masking and ion implantation or may be omitted entirely. The electrodes  117  contact the source and drain regions  115  and are disposed on the bottom of the p-type semiconductor layer  113  (i.e., on the side of layer  113  opposite to the first insulating layer  111 ). Preferably, the electrodes  117  comprise N+ polysilicon rails which extend in a direction perpendicular to the gate line  103 . If desired, an optional metal or metal silicide layer is formed in contact with electrodes  117  to increase their conductivity. However, the electrodes  117  may comprise metal or metal silicide instead of the heavily doped polysilicon, if desired. A planar insulating filler layer  118 , such as silicon oxide, is disposed between the source and drain electrodes  117 .  \\n     [0052] Thus, each NMOS TFT  119  is located between adjacent source and drain regions  115  and comprises a portion of layers  105 ,  111 ,  113  and  117 , as illustrated in FIG. 5B. The PMOS TFTs  121  are located above the NMOS TFTs  119 .  \\n     [0053] The PMOS TFTs  121  include a second insulating layer  123  adjacent to a second side of the gate electrode  103 . In FIG. 5B, layer  123  is located on the P+ polysilicon layer  109  of the gate line  103 . The insulating layer  123  may be a conventional gate dielectric. If it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM in the same array of transistors, then the insulating layer  123  is preferably a charge storage layer, such as an ONO stack or isolated nanocrystals, to form charge storage CMOS TFTs, such as EEPROM CMOS TFTs. If floating gate type EEPROM CMOS TFTs are desired, then a floating gate and a control gate dielectric may be added between the insulating layer  123  and the gate line  103 .  \\n     [0054] An n-type semiconductor layer  125 , such as an Npolysilicon layer, is disposed above the second insulating layer  123 . Layer  125  is disposed on the opposite side of layer  123  from the gate electrode  103 . P+ source and drain regions  127  are disposed in layer  125 , such that regions of layer  125  between the source and drain regions  127  comprise channel regions of PMOS TFTs. Source and drain electrodes  129  are disposed over the N\u2212 polysilicon layer  125  and in contact with the source and drain regions  129 . Thus, the electrodes  129  are disposed on top side of the N\u2212 polysilicon layer  125  opposite to the second insulating layer  123 . A planar insulating filler layer  131 , such as silicon oxide, is disposed between the source and drain electrodes  129 . If desired, an optional metal or metal silicide layer is formed in contact with electrodes  129  to increase their conductivity.  \\n     [0055] Thus, each PMOS TFT  121  is located between adjacent source and drain regions  127  and comprises a portion of layers  109 ,  123 ,  125  and  129 , as illustrated in FIG. 5B. The NMOS TFT  119  and the PMOS TFT  121  directly above it together comprise a TFT EEPROM CMOS device, which is an NMOS transistor and a PMOS transistor with a common gate electrode  103 , and with each preferably using a charge storage medium for a gate dielectric. If desired, the CMOS structure may be inverted and the PMOS TFTs formed below NMOS TFTs. It should be noted that NMOS and PMOS electrodes (i.e., bit lines) do not have to fall directly on top of each other, although they preferably should have the same pitch. NMOS and PMOS transistors thus can have different channel lengths, but the pitch (and thus array size) will be limited by the longer of the two channel lengths. The TFT  119 ,  121  channel length is determined by the space between the adjacent rails  117  or  129 . The array shown in FIG. 5B may be extended to a monolithic three dimensional array by forming additional device levels in the vertical direction with or without interlevel insulating layers, as shown in FIGS.  3 ,  4 A-D or  5 A.  \\n     [0056] The TFTs  119  and  121  comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1. Thus, some NMOS TFTs are enabled while others are disabled using a mask. Likewise, some PMOS TFTs are enabled while others are disabled using a mask. In one preferred aspect, TFTs of one conductivity type (i.e., NMOS or PMOS TFTs) contain a charge storage layer or region, while TFTs of the other conductivity type (i.e., PMOS or NMOS) do not have a charge storage region or layer. Thus, the CMOS of this aspect comprises one EEPROM TFT and one non-EEPROM TFT. In this case the EEPROM is formed in the portion of the array containing charge storage TFTs.  \\n     [0057] As described above, the transistors in the mask ROM array preferably contain a charge storage region. Thus, the transistors for the mask ROM may also be used for an EEPROM. The transistors may comprise any type of TFTs or metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in a bulk silicon substrate. The addition of a charge storage region to transistors of a mask ROM array is particularly advantageous because it allows some cells in the array to be preprogrammed prior to packaging the array in the factory using the mask ROM techniques, while it allows other cells in the array to be programmed in the field after packaging the array using EEPROM programming techniques (such as hot carrier injection or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling). The two stage programming of the array is advantageous because it improves the flexibility of the device processing. For example, the standard cells in the array may be preprogrammed in the factory, while the user-desired cells may be preprogrammed in the field by the user. However, since the mask ROM and the EEPROM are formed in the same array of transistors containing a charge storage region, the manufacturing costs are decreased, since separate mask ROM and EEPROM transistors do not have to be fabricated.  \\n     [0058] An example of two stage programming is illustrated using an static random access memory (SRAM) preprogrammed by mask ROM techniques and a logic gate programmed in the field. FIG. 6 illustrates a circuit schematic of an unprogrammed TFT CMOS array  100  of FIG. 5B. The array  100  is a matrix of NMOS  119  and PMOS  121  devices with common gates  103 . In one portion of the array  100 , a 5\u00d76 SRAM cell  180  is formed by mask ROM preprogramming, as described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 7. The programming process comprises the following steps.  \\n     [0059] First, the rails  117  and the p-type semiconductor layer  113  are formed. Then, a first mask is formed over layer  113  of all NMOS TFTs  119  in the circuit of FIG. 7, before the charge storage layer  111  is formed on layer  113 . The mask covers regions where NMOS access transistors  189  and  190  and NMOS inverter transistors  191  and  192  will be formed. The channel portions of layer  113  in areas where the other NMOS transistors will be formed is etched such the other NMOS TFTs  119 ,  150  in FIGS. 5 and 7, respectively, are disabled.  \\n     [0060] Second, the first charge storage layer  111  is formed over the patterned layer  113 . A second mask is formed over layer  111 . Layer  111  is removed at locations  148  in FIG. 7. The gate line  103  is then formed on the patterned layer  111 . Since layer  113  is removed at locations  148 , the gate lines ( 103  in FIG. 5B, 181 and  183  in FIG. 7) are shorted to the source and drain rails ( 117  in FIG. 5B, 185,  187  in FIG. 7) at locations  148 .  \\n     [0061] The second charge storage layer  123  is then formed on the gate line  103 . A third mask is formed over layer  123 . Layer  123  is removed at locations  148  in FIG. 7.  \\n     [0062] The n-type semiconductor layer  125  is then formed over the patterned layer  123 . A fourth mask is formed over layer  125 . The mask covers regions where PMOS inverter transistors  193  and  194  will be formed. The channel regions of layer  125  in areas where the other PMOS transistors will be formed is etched such the other PMOS TFTs  121 ,  150  in FIGS. 5 and 7, respectively, are disabled.  \\n     [0063] The rails  129  are formed over the patterned layer  125 . Since layers  123  and  125  are removed at locations  148  in FIG. 7, the gate lines ( 103  in FIG. 5B, 181 and  183  in FIG. 7) are shorted to the source and drain rails ( 129  in FIG. 5B, 186,  188  in FIG. 7) at locations  148 .  \\n     [0064] Thus, a 5\u00d76 SRAM cell  180  is formed, as shown in FIG. 7. In the SRAM cell, the transistors  189  and  190  are the SRAM access transistors, while transistors  191 ,  192 ,  193  and  194  are the cross coupled inverters. The cell is accessed by placing a positive voltage on the word line  195 . Data is input onto and read out of BL and BL-bar, which are provided into bit lines  196  and  197 , respectively. Voltages V SS  and V DD  are provided into bit lines  198  and  199 , respectively.  \\n     [0065] Since all of the \u201clinks\u201d (gate/bitline shorts) and the \u201cantilinks\u201d (removed channels) are formed prior to field programming, all of the linkable nodes do not have to be brought out of the array. This allows a 6 transistor SRAM bit cell with an area of about 80F 2  to be made.  \\n     [0066] After the SRAM  180  is preprogrammed, one or more logic devices, such as inverters, NAND gates and/or NOR gates are programmed in the field by the end user. The logic devices may be programmed by EEPROM and/or antifuse programming techniques (i.e., where a link between the gate and source or drain region is formed). As shown in FIG. 8, another portion of the unprogrammed array  100  is programmed to form a 4\u00d74 inverter cell  143 . This portion may be laterally spaced from the SRAM  180  or it may be located in another device level, if the array comprises a three dimensional array.  \\n     [0067] First, a high voltage is applied between gate (i.e., word) line  145  and bit lines  147 , which will be used to carry the output voltage, V out . This causes conductive antifuse links  148  to form to electrically connect lines  145  and  147 . Then, the driver circuit provides a programming voltage to all other transistors  150  to increase their threshold voltage to turn them off, except to NMOS transistors  155  and PMOS transistors  157 . The NMOS  155  and PMOS  157  transistors form the inverter. When a high voltage, V in , is provided into gate line  149 , then a low voltage, V out , is read out, and vice-versa. Voltages V SS  (i.e., ground) and V DD  (i.e., power supply voltage) are provided into bit lines  151  and  153  which are connected to transistors  155  and  157 .  \\n     [0068] Thus, the array contains a plurality of TFTs with charge storage regions, some of which are programmed by mask ROM techniques, others by EEPROM techniques, while yet others are programmed by anti-fuse techniques. Thus, the array programming flexibility is increased while its cost is reduced because all the transistors in the array are the same.  \\n     [0069] In the above described preferred embodiments, the use of polysilicon layers was described. However, amorphous silicon, single crystal silicon or non-silicon semiconductor materials may be used instead. The polysilicon layers described above may be deposited as polysilicon layers by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other methods. The semiconductor layers may be in-situ doped during deposition or these layers may be doped by ion implantation or diffusion after deposition. Furthermore, the polysilicon layers, such as the channel layer, may be first deposited as amorphous silicon layers and then crystallized to form polysilicon or single crystal silicon layers. The crystallization may be carried out by laser, flash lamp and/or thermal (i.e., furnace) annealing. If desired, a transition metal or germanium crystallization catalyst material may be placed in contact with the amorphous silicon layers to increase the polysilicon grain size after the crystallization. Such transition catalyst materials may comprise nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and other transition metals. The insulating and conductive layers described above may be deposited by any known method, such as CVD, sputtering, plating, spin-on coating (for spin-on glass), etc.  \\n     [0070] In the various embodiments described above, metal silicide layers were formed in contact with silicon layers, such as the polysilicon source and drain regions or gate electrodes. One preferred method of forming a metal silicide layer, such as a titanium silicide layer, in contact with a silicon layer is by using a silicon cap and a TiN layer. The titanium silicide layer is formed on an undoped amorphous silicon cap layer. The cap layer is formed on a heavily doped silicon layer, such as a polysilicon or amorphous silicon layer doped to a concentration in excess of 10 19  cm \u22123 , such as 10 19  cm \u22123  to 10 21  cm \u22123 . The cap layer is preferably deposited on P+ polysilicon or N+ amorphous silicon layers. The N+ amorphous silicon may then be recrystallized into N+ polysilicon during subsequent annealing steps.  \\n     [0071] A method of forming a titanium silicide (TiSi 2 ) layer comprises the following steps. A heavily doped polysilicon layer is deposited. For example, a P+ polysilicon layer is boron doped to a concentration of 5\u00d710 20  cm \u22123 , and has a thickness of about 1400 Angstroms. A cap layer of undoped amorphous silicon is deposited on the P+ polysilicon layer. The cap may be 600 Angstroms thick, for example. A titanium layer is deposited on the cap. The titanium layer may be 250 Angstroms thick, for example. A titanium nitride layer is deposited on the titanium layer. The titanium nitride layer may be 100 Angstroms thick, for example. Other layer thicknesses may be used, as required.  \\n     [0072] The layers are annealed at a temperature below 650\u00b0 C. for less than five minutes to react the titanium and the silicon in the cap to form a C49 phase TiSi 2  layer. The anneal may be carried out at 600\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, for example. If desired, another P+ polysilicon layer is deposited over the stack and the stack is etched into a thin \u201cwire\u201d or \u201crail\u201d, such as a word line or bit line. The wire or rail may be 0.25 microns wide or less. The titanium silicide is then transformed from the C49 to the C54 phase by a high temperature (i.e., above 650\u00b0 C.) anneal. The anneal can take place before or after the wires or rails are patterned, at 800\u00b0 C. for one minute, for example. By annealing each Si/Ti/TiN film stack below 650\u00b0 C., dopant diffusion and thermal grooving of the TiSi 2  is minimized. Multiple film stacks can be deposited and etched sequentially.  \\n     [0073] The foregoing description of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,572,046 and 5,383,149 also suggest using TFTs in a mask read only memory (mask ROM or MROM). Conventional TFTs have a structure that is similar to conventional bulk metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), except that TFTs are formed in a semiconductor layer that is located above an insulating substrate, such as a glass substrate, or above a semiconductor substrate that is covered by an insulating layer. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0004\" num=\"0004\">[0004] The mask ROM derives its name from the fact that this nonvolatile memory is programmed or written using a custom mask during fabrication. In a conventional mask ROM fabrication process, a semi-finished array of transistors is covered by a photoresist layer. This photoresist layer is patterned using the custom photolithography mask to expose the channel regions of a first set of transistors while covering the channel regions of a second set of transistors of the array. The exposed channel regions are then rendered non-conductive by implanting the exposed channel regions of a first conductivity type with ions of the same conductivity type in order to raise the threshold voltage of the implanted transistors. Thus, the mask ROM array contains a first set of enabled transistors and a second set of disabled transistors. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0005\" num=\"0005\">[0005] Each bit of information in a mask ROM is stored by the presence or absence of a data path from a word (access) line to a bit (sense) line. The data path is eliminated by ensuring that no operational circuit element (i.e., transistor) joins a word and a bit line, such as by increasing the threshold voltage of selected transistors by the selective ion implantation. When a word line of a mask ROM is activated, the presence of a signal on the bit line will mean that a \u201c1\u201d is stored, whereas the absence of a signal will indicate that the bit location is storing a \u201c0\u201d, as discussed on pages 619-621 of S. Wolf, <i>Silicon Processing for the VLSI Era, Vol. </i>2, Lattice Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference. Mask ROM arrays may be implemented as NOR or NAND arrays, for example. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0006\" num=\"0006\">[0006] The state of the art mask ROM has an effective cell area of 4F<sup>2</sup>, where F is the minimum feature size. This cell area is larger than desirable, and leads to a less than optimum cell density, which increases the cost of the mask ROM. </p>\\n      <heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>\\n      <p id=\"P-0007\" num=\"0007\">[0007] A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array, comprising a plurality of device levels, wherein each device level comprises a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0008\" num=\"0008\">[0008] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a TFT mask ROM array, comprising (a) a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails disposed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction and (b) a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction.

The TFTs are formed at intersections of two adjacent first rails and the second rail stack. The TFTs comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0009\" num=\"0009\">[0009] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a mask ROM array, comprising a first set of enabled transistors containing a charge storage region, and a second set of partially or totally disabled transistors. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0010\" num=\"0010\">[0010] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method of making monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array, comprising forming a first device level comprising a plurality of TFTs over a substrate, forming a first mask over the first device level, and partially or totally disabling a first set of TFTs in the first device level. The method also comprises forming a second device level comprising a plurality of TFTs over the first device level, forming a second mask over the second device level, and partially or totally disabling a second set of TFTs in the second device level. </p>\\n      <p id=\"P-0011\" num=\"0011\">[0011] Another preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a method of making a TFT mask ROM array, comprising forming a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails disposed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction, forming a first semiconductor layer whose first surface is in contact with said first plurality of spaced apart conductors and forming a first mask over the first semiconductor layer. The method also comprises selectively etching unmasked portions of the first semiconductor layer or selectively implanting ions into unmasked portions of the first semiconductor layer, forming a conductive film, and forming a gate insulating film disposed between a second surface of the first semiconductor layer and the conductive film.

By integrating the array in three dimensions, the effective cell area of the array is reduced to 4F<sup>2</sup>/N, where F is the minimum feature size and N is the number of device levels in the array. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0018\" num=\"0018\">[0018]FIG. 1 illustrates a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array <b>1</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The array comprises a plurality of device levels <b>2</b> separated by interlevel insulating layers <b>3</b>. There may be two or more device levels, such as four to eight device levels <b>2</b>, separated by one or more interlevel insulating layers <b>3</b>, such as three to seven insulating layers <b>3</b>. The device levels <b>2</b> alternate with interlevel insulating layers <b>3</b>. The array <b>1</b> is preferably formed over a substrate <b>4</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0019\" num=\"0019\">[0019] Each device level <b>2</b> contains a first set of enabled TFTs <b>5</b> and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs <b>6</b>. In one preferred aspect of the invention, the term \u201ctotally disabled\u201d means that a particular TFT is rendered permanently off for any input voltage. In another preferred aspect of the invention, the term \u201cpartially disabled\u201d means either that a threshold voltage of a particular TFT has been increased such that this TFT is in the off state for a particular value of input voltage that would be sufficient to turn an enabled TFT on and/or that a sense current of this TFT is lower than that of an enabled TFT. However, a partially disabled TFT may be turned on by providing an input voltage higher than the input voltage sufficient to turn the enabled TFT on. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0020\" num=\"0020\">[0020] In one preferred aspect of the invention, the second set of TFTs <b>6</b> comprises only totally disabled TFTs. In another preferred aspect of the invention, the second set of TFTs <b>6</b> contains both totally and partially disabled TFTs. Thus, a so-called \u201cmultilevel\u201d mask ROM array <b>1</b> is formed if the array contains partially disabled TFTs. An example of a conventional multilevel mask ROM is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,029, incorporated herein by reference. In a multilevel mask ROM, multiple levels of conduction current may be sensed when the ROM array is accessed, since a different amount of conduction current is sensed from bit lines of the enabled and the partially disabled TFTs. Of course, the second set of TFTs <b>6</b> may only contain partially disabled TFTs if desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0021\" num=\"0021\">[0021] It should be noted the array <b>1</b> may contain optional additional device levels (not shown in FIG. 1) which contain only enabled TFTs <b>5</b> or only disabled TFTs <b>6</b>. Furthermore, the optional additional device levels may contain devices other than TFTs and be used for circuits other than the mask ROM. For example, peripheral or driver circuits may be formed in the substrate <b>4</b> or in one or more array <b>1</b> device levels <b>2</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0022\" num=\"0022\">[0022] A TFT may be disabled by any means that prevents or restricts a flow of data (i.e,, current) between the word line and the bit line contacting the TFT. For example, the TFTs of the second set <b>6</b> may be disabled by removing at least a portion of channel regions of these TFTs using a mask, such as a photoresist mask, to render these TFTs totally inoperative. Alternatively, the TFTs of the second set <b>6</b> may be disabled by selectively doping channel regions of these TFTs using a mask to increase the threshold voltage of these TFTs above a predetermined amount to render said TFTs partially or totally inoperative. Furthermore, the TFTs of the second set <b>6</b> may be totally disabled by removing (i.e., etching) unmasked contacts between a word line or a bit line and the TFTs. For example, a gate electrode, source or drain electrodes and/or source or drain regions may be removed to disable the TFT. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0023\" num=\"0023\">[0023] For example, in one preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of channel regions of a first subset <b>7</b> of the TFTs of the second set <b>6</b> have been selectively removed to render the first subset <b>7</b> of the TFTs totally disabled, as shown in FIG. 1. The channel regions of a second subset <b>8</b> of the TFTs of the second set <b>6</b> have been selectively doped to increase a threshold voltage of said TFTs to render said TFTs partially disabled to form a multilevel mask ROM, as shown in FIG. 1. The first <b>7</b> and the second <b>8</b> subsets are disabled using different masks. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0024\" num=\"0024\">[0024] In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the first subset of TFTs <b>7</b> may be rendered totally disabled by a first threshold voltage adjustment implant, while the second subset of TFTs <b>8</b> may be rendered partially disabled by a lower concentration threshold voltage adjustment implant. Preferably, the first and the second implants are carried out at the same time through the same photoresist mask using the same dose of implanted ions. The photoresist mask fully covers the channel regions of the enabled TFTs, partially covers the channel regions of the partially disabled TFTs, and does not cover the channel regions of the fully disabled TFTs. The difference in mask coverage results in a different concentration of ions being implanted into the TFT channel regions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0025\" num=\"0025\">[0025] The TFTs <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> may comprise any type of metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) TFTs, such as top gate co-planar TFTs, top gate staggered TFTs, bottom gate co-planar TFTs and/or bottom gate staggered TFTs. In co-planar TFTs, the source/drain electrodes and the gate electrode are on the same side of the channel. In staggered TFTs, the source/drain electrodes and the gate electrode are on the opposite sides of the channel. The array <b>1</b> may comprise one type of TFTs or more than one type of TFTs. Furthermore, TFTs may comprise bipolar TFTs, if desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0026\" num=\"0026\">[0026] In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mask ROM array is provided in a \u201crail stack\u201d staggered TFT configuration. FIG. 2 illustrates one preferred configuration of an array <b>10</b> of top gate staggered rail stack TFTs. The array <b>10</b> includes a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails <b>11</b> disposed at a first height above a substrate (not shown for clarity) in a first direction. The array also includes a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks <b>12</b> disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction. Each rail stack includes a first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> whose first surface <b>15</b> is in contact with the first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails <b>11</b>. Each rail stack <b>12</b> also includes a conductive film <b>17</b> and a gate insulating film <b>16</b> disposed between a second surface <b>18</b> of the first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> and the conductive film <b>17</b>. Each TFT cell <b>19</b> is formed at the intersection of two adjacent first rails <b>11</b> and one second rail stack <b>12</b>. The TFT <b>19</b> channel length is determined by the space between the adjacent rails <b>11</b>, and its channel width is determined by the width of the second rail stack <b>12</b>. The TFTs <b>19</b> comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0027\" num=\"0027\">[0027] The first plurality of rails <b>11</b> preferably comprise heavily doped polysilicon layers <b>21</b> of a first conductivity type (i.e., N+ or P+) in contact with metal or a metal silicide layers <b>22</b>. The metal or metal silicide layers <b>22</b> are preferably formed buried within the rails <b>11</b>, but may also be formed on the sides and/or bottom of the rails <b>11</b>. The metal may comprise aluminum, copper, tungsten or titanium (including titanium nitride). The metal silicide may comprise any silicide, such as titanium, tungsten, cobalt, platinum or nickel silicide. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0028\" num=\"0028\">[0028] The first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> preferably comprises a polysilicon layer of a second conductivity type (i.e., P\u2212 or N\u2212). However, an amorphous silicon layer may be used instead. The substrate may be a silicon or other semiconductor substrate with an overlying interlevel insulating layer. Alternatively, the substrate may comprise an insulating material, such as glass, quartz, ceramic or plastic. The conductive film <b>17</b> preferably comprises a polysilicon layer <b>23</b> and a metal silicide layer <b>24</b>. As used herein, a \u201cfilm\u201d may contain one or more \u201clayers\u201d. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0029\" num=\"0029\">[0029] The gate insulating film <b>16</b> may comprise a silicon oxide or a silicon nitride layer or any other one or more insulating layers. In one preferred embodiment, film <b>16</b> comprises a portion of a charge storage region. Preferably, film <b>16</b> comprises a portion of a charge storage region, when it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable ROM) together in the same array of transistors, as will be described in more detail below with respect to FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b>. The charge storage region may comprises a dielectric isolated floating gate (i.e., a polysilicon floating gate located between a tunnel dielectric and a control gate dielectric), an ONO dielectric film (i.e., a stack of silicon oxide/silicon nitride or oxynitridelsilicon oxide layers) or an insulating layer containing conductive nanocrystals. The ONO dielectric film comprises a tunnel oxide, a charge storage Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4-x</sub>O<sub>1.5x </sub>layer, where x is 0 to 1, and a blocking oxide. The tunnel oxide has a thickness of 1.5 nm to 7 nm, preferably 2.5 nm. The charge storage silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4-x</sub>O<sub>1.5x</sub>) layer has a thickness of at least 4 nm, preferably 4-15 nm, most preferably 5 nm. The blocking oxide layer has a thickness of 3 nm to 9 nm, preferably 4.0 nm. The insulating layer containing the conductive nanocrystals may comprise silicon, tungsten or aluminum nanocrystals dispersed in a silicon oxide, nitride or oxynitride insulating layer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0030\" num=\"0030\">[0030] The polysilicon layers <b>21</b> of the first rails <b>11</b> comprise at least a portion of the TFT <b>19</b> source and drain regions. The conductive film <b>17</b> comprises a gate of the TFTs. Portions of the first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> comprise TFT channel regions of a second conductivity type. If desired, optional doped regions <b>25</b> of a first conductivity type may be outdiffused from layers <b>21</b> into the first semiconductor layer <b>13</b>. Thus, optional regions <b>25</b> and layers <b>21</b> comprise the TFT <b>19</b> source and drain regions, while the metal or metal silicide layers <b>22</b> comprise the source and drain electrodes. Alternatively, regions <b>25</b> may be omitted and layers <b>21</b> may comprise the entire source and drain regions of the TFTs <b>19</b>. Furthermore, if desired, intrinsic or lightly doped polysilicon layers of the first conductivity type may be formed in the first rails <b>11</b> between the heavily doped layers <b>21</b> and the first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> to form offset or low doped drain (LDD) layers. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0031\" num=\"0031\">[0031] Preferably, a first planarized insulating layer <b>26</b>, such as silicon oxide, is located between the first rails <b>11</b>, and a second planarized insulating layer <b>27</b>, such as silicon oxide, is located between the second rail stacks <b>12</b> (layers <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are shown by dashed lines in FIG. 2 for clarity). Alternatively, one or more of silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, spin-on glass, BPSG, PSG or BSG may be used instead of or in addition to silicon oxide. Layers <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> may be planarized by chemical mechanical polishing or by other planarization methods. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0032\" num=\"0032\">[0032] In FIG. 2, the first rails <b>11</b> are located below the second rail stacks <b>12</b> to form an array <b>10</b> of top gate staggered TFTs (i.e., the gate <b>17</b> is formed above the channel <b>13</b> on the opposite side of the source and drain regions <b>21</b>). Alternatively, the first rails <b>11</b> may be located above the second rail stacks <b>12</b> (i.e., layers <b>13</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>) to form an array <b>20</b> of bottom gate staggered TFTs, as shown in FIG. 3. If desired, the arrays <b>10</b> or <b>20</b> may be formed in a monolithic three dimensional array. In this case, the array comprises a plurality of device levels <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C, each containing an array <b>10</b> or <b>20</b>, separated by interlevel insulating layers <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D, similar to the array shown in FIG. 1. However, since the rail stack arrays <b>10</b> or <b>20</b> have a high density, these arrays may comprise only one device level, if desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0033\" num=\"0033\">[0033] The mask ROM arrays of the preferred embodiments described above may be made by any method. A preferred method of making a monolithic three dimensional TFT mask ROM array includes the following steps shown in FIGS. <b>4</b>A-D. A first device level <b>2</b>A comprising a plurality of TFT channel regions is provided over a substrate <b>4</b>. The first device level <b>2</b>A contains a semiconductor layer <b>9</b>A that will used to form TFT channel regions. Preferably, layer <b>9</b>A is formed over an insulating layer <b>3</b>A, which is formed over the substrate <b>4</b>, as shown in FIG. 4A. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0034\" num=\"0034\">[0034] A first mask <b>31</b>, such as a photoresist mask, is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>9</b>A. Mask <b>31</b> covers all of layer <b>9</b>A where the channel regions of the first set of TFTs <b>5</b> will be formed, except region(s) <b>33</b>, where the channel regions of the second set of TFTs <b>6</b> will be formed, as shown in FIG. 4A. A second set of TFTs <b>6</b> in the first device level <b>2</b>A is then totally or partially disabled by selective etching or ion implanting the unmasked channel regions <b>33</b> of the second set of TFTs <b>6</b>. For example, selective ion implanting is schematically shown in FIG. 4A by arrows and the \u201cxx\u201d symbol. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0035\" num=\"0035\">[0035] The TFTs <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of the array are then completed by forming a gate insulating layer on the channels, gate electrodes on the gate insulating layer, source and drain regions, and any other required layers for a functional TFT, as shown in FIG. 4B. Alternatively, the step of forming a mask <b>31</b> and the step of disabling the TFTs <b>6</b> by etching or ion implantation may be carried out after the first and the second sets of TFTs <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> have been completed. Thus, the ion implantation may be carried out through the gate electrode into the channel. Likewise, the selective etching may be used to remove the gate electrode in addition to or instead of removing the channel. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0036\" num=\"0036\">[0036] A first interlevel insulating layer <b>3</b>B is then formed over the first device level <b>2</b>A, as shown in FIG. 4B. Layer <b>3</b>B may comprise one or more of silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, spin-on glass, BPSG, PSG, BSG or any other insulating layers. The first interlevel insulating layer <b>3</b>B is preferably planarized by chemical mechanical polishing or etchback. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0037\" num=\"0037\">[0037] A second device level <b>2</b>B comprising a plurality of TFT channel regions is formed over the first interlevel insulating layer <b>3</b>B, as shown in FIG. 4C. The second device level <b>2</b>B contains a semiconductor layer <b>9</b>B that will used to form TFT channel regions. A second mask <b>35</b>, such as a photoresist mask, is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>9</b>B, such that it covers all of layer <b>9</b>B where the channel regions of the first set of TFTs <b>5</b> will be formed, except region(s) <b>37</b>, where the channel regions of the second set of TFTs <b>6</b> will be formed, as shown in FIG. 4C. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0038\" num=\"0038\">[0038] A second set of TFTs <b>6</b> in the second device level <b>2</b>B are then totally or partially disabled by selective etching or ion implanting the unmasked channel regions <b>37</b> of the second set of TFTs <b>6</b>. The TFTs <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of the array are then completed by forming a gate insulating layer on the channels, gate electrodes on the gate insulating layer, source and drain regions, and any other required layers for a functional TFT, as shown in FIG. 4D. If desired, a second interlevel insulating layer <b>3</b>C is formed over the second device level <b>2</b>B. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0039\" num=\"0039\">[0039] Thus, a three dimensional monolithic array is formed. Of course, the array may contain more than two device layers <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, such as four to eight device layers. To form additional device layers, a plurality of interlevel insulating layers are formed. A plurality of device levels comprising a plurality of TFTs are formed over the plurality of interlevel insulating layers (i.e., each interlevel insulating layer is formed between adjacent device layers). A mask is formed over each of the plurality of device levels, and a second set of TFTs in the plurality of device levels is partially or totally disabled. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0040\" num=\"0040\">[0040] The term \u201cmonolithic\u201d, as used above, means that layers of each level of the array were directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. Thus, a first array of transistors is formed in a first semiconductor layer. Then, an interlayer insulating layer is formed over the first array of transistors. A second semiconductor layer is formed over the second interlayer insulating layer. A second array of transistors is formed in the second semiconductor layer to form a monolithic three dimensional array. Additional array levels may be formed in the same fashion if desired. In contrast, two dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a nonmonolithic memory device. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0041\" num=\"0041\">[0041] A similar method may be used to form an array of rail stack TFTs shown in FIGS. <b>2</b> or <b>3</b>. To form the array <b>10</b> of top gated TFTs shown in FIG. 2, a first plurality of spaced apart conductor rails <b>11</b> are formed at a first height above a substrate in a first direction. Then, a first semiconductor layer <b>13</b> is formed such that its first surface <b>15</b> is in contact with said first plurality of spaced apart conductors <b>11</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0042\" num=\"0042\">[0042] A first mask <b>31</b> is formed over the first semiconductor layer <b>13</b>, similar to that shown in FIG. 4A. The unmasked portions of layer <b>13</b> are selectively etched or ion implanted, similar to that shown in FIG. 4A. Thereafter, the gate insulating film <b>16</b> and conductive film <b>17</b> are formed over the etched or implanted first semiconductor layer <b>13</b>. Then, a second photoresist mask (not shown) is formed over the conductive film <b>17</b>. The first semiconductor layer <b>13</b>, the gate insulating film <b>16</b> and the conductive film <b>17</b> are then patterned (i.e., etched) using the second mask to form a second plurality of spaced apart rail stacks <b>12</b>. The rail stacks are disposed at a second height in a second direction different from the first direction, as shown in FIG. 2. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0043\" num=\"0043\">[0043] To form the array <b>20</b> of bottom gated TFTs of FIG. 3, the order of steps is reversed. The conductive film <b>17</b> and the gate insulating film <b>16</b> and the first semiconductor film <b>13</b> are formed in this order. Then, the first mask <b>31</b> is formed over layer <b>13</b> and the selective etching or ion implantation of layer <b>13</b> is performed. Then, the films <b>17</b> and <b>16</b> and layer <b>13</b> are patterned to form the second rail stacks <b>12</b>. If desired, the rail stacks <b>12</b> may be formed before forming the first mask <b>31</b> on layer <b>13</b>. Then, the first rails <b>11</b> are formed on the second rail stacks <b>12</b>, as shown in FIG. 3. If desired, the arrays <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may be included in a monolithic three dimensional array by forming an interlevel insulating layer over each array and forming another array <b>10</b> or <b>20</b> over the interlayer insulating layer, as many times as desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0044\" num=\"0044\">[0044]FIGS. 1, 2 and <b>4</b>A-D illustrate a monolithic three dimensional array where adjacent device levels are separated by an interlevel insulating layer. However, in another preferred embodiment of the present invention, some or all interlevel insulating layers are omitted and at least two adjacent device levels in a monolithic three dimensional array contact each other, as shown in FIG. 5A. The exemplary array <b>30</b> illustrated in FIG. 5A contains four device levels <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D. Of course, there may be more or less than four device levels. The array <b>30</b> is similar to arrays <b>10</b> or <b>20</b>, except that layers of the array <b>30</b> are copied in a mirror image fashion in the vertical direction. The layers in FIG. 5A are numbered in the same fashion as in FIGS. 2 and 3, except that the layers have a suffix, such as \u201cA\u201d through \u201cD\u201d, depending on which device level <b>2</b>A-D contains the particular device layer. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0045\" num=\"0045\">[0045] In the layout of FIG. 5A, rails <b>11</b> A are shared between adjacent device levels <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B, while rails <b>11</b> B are shared between adjacent device levels <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D. Likewise, the conductive layer (i.e., gate electrode) <b>17</b>B of rail stack <b>12</b>B is shared between adjacent device levels <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C. Thus, adjacent device level pairs <b>2</b>A/<b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>B/<b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>C/<b>2</b>D contact each other. However, each device level <b>2</b>A-D contains its own channel layer <b>13</b>A-D and its own gate insulating layer <b>16</b>A-D, which are not shared with adjacent device levels. Thus, each rail stack that is shared between device levels contains a conductive layer <b>17</b> between two gate insulating layers <b>16</b> and two channel layers <b>13</b>. Device levels <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>C contain bottom gated TFTs, while device levels <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>D contain top gated TFTs. The array <b>30</b> may contain n-type or p-type TFTs, as desired. The TFTs of array <b>30</b> comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0046\" num=\"0046\">[0046]FIGS. 2, 3 and <b>5</b>A illustrate an array of n-type TFTs (i.e., NMOS) or p-type TFTs (i.e., PMOS) according to the preferred embodiments of the invention. FIG. 5B illustrates one device level of a vertically stacked, common gate CMOS mask ROM array in a rail stack configuration according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The CMOS array in FIG. 5B is similar to the arrays illustrated in FIGS. 2, 3 or <b>5</b>A except that transistors of different charge carrier type are formed on either side of the gate line. In FIG. 5B, the NMOS transistors are arranged below the PMOS transistors. However, it should be understood that the PMOS transistors may be arranged below the NMOS transistors if desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0047\" num=\"0047\">[0047] In FIG. 5B, the array of CMOS devices <b>100</b> is preferably formed over a planarized interlayer insulating layer <b>101</b>, such as a CMP planarized silicon oxide layer. Layer <b>101</b> is formed over a substrate (not shown) as in the previous embodiments. Each CMOS device is thus a CMOS TFT because it is formed over an insulating layer. However, the CMOS devices may be formed in a monocrystalline silicon substrate, if desired. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0048\" num=\"0048\">[0048] The array includes a plurality of gate lines (i.e., word lines) <b>103</b> (only one gate line is shown in the cross sectional view of FIG. 5B). Preferably the gate line comprises a first N+ polysilicon layer <b>105</b>, a silicide layer <b>107</b>, such as a TiSi<sub>x </sub>or WSi<sub>x </sub>layer, over the first polysilicon layer and a second P+ polysilicon layer <b>109</b> above the silicide layer. The gate line <b>103</b> acts as a gate electrode in each TFT. Thus, no separate gate electrodes connected to the gate lines are required. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0049\" num=\"0049\">[0049] A first insulating layer <b>111</b> is disposed adjacent to a first side of the gate electrode <b>103</b>. This insulating layer <b>111</b> may be a conventional gate dielectric. If it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM in the same array of transistors, then the insulating layer <b>111</b> is preferably a charge storage layer, such as an ONO stack or isolated nanocrystals, to form charge storage CMOS TFTs, such as EEPROM CMOS TFTs. If floating gate type EEPROM CMOS TFTs are desired, then a floating gate and a control gate dielectric may be added between the insulating layer <b>111</b> and the gate line <b>103</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0050\" num=\"0050\">[0050] A p-type semiconductor layer <b>113</b>, such as a P\u2212 polysilicon layer, is disposed on a side of the first insulating layer opposite to the gate <b>103</b>. This layer contains the NMOS TFT bodies. N+ source and drain regions <b>115</b> are disposed in layer <b>113</b>. The portions of layer <b>113</b> between regions <b>115</b> comprise NMOS TFT channel regions. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0051\" num=\"0051\">[0051] Preferably, the source and drain regions <b>115</b> are formed by outdiffusion of n-type dopants from the source and drain electrodes (i.e., bit lines) <b>117</b>. However, regions <b>115</b> may be formed by any other method, such as by masking and ion implantation or may be omitted entirely. The electrodes <b>117</b> contact the source and drain regions <b>115</b> and are disposed on the bottom of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>113</b> (i.e., on the side of layer <b>113</b> opposite to the first insulating layer <b>111</b>). Preferably, the electrodes <b>117</b> comprise N+ polysilicon rails which extend in a direction perpendicular to the gate line <b>103</b>. If desired, an optional metal or metal silicide layer is formed in contact with electrodes <b>117</b> to increase their conductivity. However, the electrodes <b>117</b> may comprise metal or metal silicide instead of the heavily doped polysilicon, if desired. A planar insulating filler layer <b>118</b>, such as silicon oxide, is disposed between the source and drain electrodes <b>117</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0052\" num=\"0052\">[0052] Thus, each NMOS TFT <b>119</b> is located between adjacent source and drain regions <b>115</b> and comprises a portion of layers <b>105</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>117</b>, as illustrated in FIG. 5B. The PMOS TFTs <b>121</b> are located above the NMOS TFTs <b>119</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0053\" num=\"0053\">[0053] The PMOS TFTs <b>121</b> include a second insulating layer <b>123</b> adjacent to a second side of the gate electrode <b>103</b>. In FIG. 5B, layer <b>123</b> is located on the P+ polysilicon layer <b>109</b> of the gate line <b>103</b>. The insulating layer <b>123</b> may be a conventional gate dielectric. If it is desired to form a mask ROM and an EEPROM in the same array of transistors, then the insulating layer <b>123</b> is preferably a charge storage layer, such as an ONO stack or isolated nanocrystals, to form charge storage CMOS TFTs, such as EEPROM CMOS TFTs. If floating gate type EEPROM CMOS TFTs are desired, then a floating gate and a control gate dielectric may be added between the insulating layer <b>123</b> and the gate line <b>103</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0054\" num=\"0054\">[0054] An n-type semiconductor layer <b>125</b>, such as an Npolysilicon layer, is disposed above the second insulating layer <b>123</b>. Layer <b>125</b> is disposed on the opposite side of layer <b>123</b> from the gate electrode <b>103</b>. P+ source and drain regions <b>127</b> are disposed in layer <b>125</b>, such that regions of layer <b>125</b> between the source and drain regions <b>127</b> comprise channel regions of PMOS TFTs. Source and drain electrodes <b>129</b> are disposed over the N\u2212 polysilicon layer <b>125</b> and in contact with the source and drain regions <b>129</b>. Thus, the electrodes <b>129</b> are disposed on top side of the N\u2212 polysilicon layer <b>125</b> opposite to the second insulating layer <b>123</b>. A planar insulating filler layer <b>131</b>, such as silicon oxide, is disposed between the source and drain electrodes <b>129</b>. If desired, an optional metal or metal silicide layer is formed in contact with electrodes <b>129</b> to increase their conductivity. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0055\" num=\"0055\">[0055] Thus, each PMOS TFT <b>121</b> is located between adjacent source and drain regions <b>127</b> and comprises a portion of layers <b>109</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>129</b>, as illustrated in FIG. 5B. The NMOS TFT <b>119</b> and the PMOS TFT <b>121</b> directly above it together comprise a TFT EEPROM CMOS device, which is an NMOS transistor and a PMOS transistor with a common gate electrode <b>103</b>, and with each preferably using a charge storage medium for a gate dielectric. If desired, the CMOS structure may be inverted and the PMOS TFTs formed below NMOS TFTs. It should be noted that NMOS and PMOS electrodes (i.e., bit lines) do not have to fall directly on top of each other, although they preferably should have the same pitch. NMOS and PMOS transistors thus can have different channel lengths, but the pitch (and thus array size) will be limited by the longer of the two channel lengths. The TFT <b>119</b>, <b>121</b> channel length is determined by the space between the adjacent rails <b>117</b> or <b>129</b>. The array shown in FIG. 5B may be extended to a monolithic three dimensional array by forming additional device levels in the vertical direction with or without interlevel insulating layers, as shown in FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A-D or <b>5</b>A. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0056\" num=\"0056\">[0056] The TFTs <b>119</b> and <b>121</b> comprise a first set of enabled TFTs and a second set of partially or totally disabled TFTs, as described with respect to FIG. 1. Thus, some NMOS TFTs are enabled while others are disabled using a mask. Likewise, some PMOS TFTs are enabled while others are disabled using a mask. In one preferred aspect, TFTs of one conductivity type (i.e., NMOS or PMOS TFTs) contain a charge storage layer or region, while TFTs of the other conductivity type (i.e., PMOS or NMOS) do not have a charge storage region or layer. Thus, the CMOS of this aspect comprises one EEPROM TFT and one non-EEPROM TFT. In this case the EEPROM is formed in the portion of the array containing charge storage TFTs. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0057\" num=\"0057\">[0057] As described above, the transistors in the mask ROM array preferably contain a charge storage region. Thus, the transistors for the mask ROM may also be used for an EEPROM. The transistors may comprise any type of TFTs or metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in a bulk silicon substrate. The addition of a charge storage region to transistors of a mask ROM array is particularly advantageous because it allows some cells in the array to be preprogrammed prior to packaging the array in the factory using the mask ROM techniques, while it allows other cells in the array to be programmed in the field after packaging the array using EEPROM programming techniques (such as hot carrier injection or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling). The two stage programming of the array is advantageous because it improves the flexibility of the device processing. For example, the standard cells in the array may be preprogrammed in the factory, while the user-desired cells may be preprogrammed in the field by the user. However, since the mask ROM and the EEPROM are formed in the same array of transistors containing a charge storage region, the manufacturing costs are decreased, since separate mask ROM and EEPROM transistors do not have to be fabricated. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0058\" num=\"0058\">[0058] An example of two stage programming is illustrated using an static random access memory (SRAM) preprogrammed by mask ROM techniques and a logic gate programmed in the field. FIG. 6 illustrates a circuit schematic of an unprogrammed TFT CMOS array <b>100</b> of FIG. 5B. The array <b>100</b> is a matrix of NMOS <b>119</b> and PMOS <b>121</b> devices with common gates <b>103</b>. In one portion of the array <b>100</b>, a 5\u00d76 SRAM cell <b>180</b> is formed by mask ROM preprogramming, as described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 7. The programming process comprises the following steps. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0059\" num=\"0059\">[0059] First, the rails <b>117</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>113</b> are formed. Then, a first mask is formed over layer <b>113</b> of all NMOS TFTs <b>119</b> in the circuit of FIG. 7, before the charge storage layer <b>111</b> is formed on layer <b>113</b>. The mask covers regions where NMOS access transistors <b>189</b> and <b>190</b> and NMOS inverter transistors <b>191</b> and <b>192</b> will be formed. The channel portions of layer <b>113</b> in areas where the other NMOS transistors will be formed is etched such the other NMOS TFTs <b>119</b>, <b>150</b> in FIGS. 5 and 7, respectively, are disabled. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0060\" num=\"0060\">[0060] Second, the first charge storage layer <b>111</b> is formed over the patterned layer <b>113</b>. A second mask is formed over layer <b>111</b>. Layer <b>111</b> is removed at locations <b>148</b> in FIG. 7. The gate line <b>103</b> is then formed on the patterned layer <b>111</b>. Since layer <b>113</b> is removed at locations <b>148</b>, the gate lines (<b>103</b> in FIG. 5B, 181 and <b>183</b> in FIG. 7) are shorted to the source and drain rails (<b>117</b> in FIG. 5B, 185, <b>187</b> in FIG. 7) at locations <b>148</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0061\" num=\"0061\">[0061] The second charge storage layer <b>123</b> is then formed on the gate line <b>103</b>. A third mask is formed over layer <b>123</b>. Layer <b>123</b> is removed at locations <b>148</b> in FIG. 7. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0062\" num=\"0062\">[0062] The n-type semiconductor layer <b>125</b> is then formed over the patterned layer <b>123</b>. A fourth mask is formed over layer <b>125</b>. The mask covers regions where PMOS inverter transistors <b>193</b> and <b>194</b> will be formed. The channel regions of layer <b>125</b> in areas where the other PMOS transistors will be formed is etched such the other PMOS TFTs <b>121</b>, <b>150</b> in FIGS. 5 and 7, respectively, are disabled. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0063\" num=\"0063\">[0063] The rails <b>129</b> are formed over the patterned layer <b>125</b>. Since layers <b>123</b> and <b>125</b> are removed at locations <b>148</b> in FIG. 7, the gate lines (<b>103</b> in FIG. 5B, 181 and <b>183</b> in FIG. 7) are shorted to the source and drain rails (<b>129</b> in FIG. 5B, 186, <b>188</b> in FIG. 7) at locations <b>148</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0064\" num=\"0064\">[0064] Thus, a 5\u00d76 SRAM cell <b>180</b> is formed, as shown in FIG. 7. In the SRAM cell, the transistors <b>189</b> and <b>190</b> are the SRAM access transistors, while transistors <b>191</b>, <b>192</b>, <b>193</b> and <b>194</b> are the cross coupled inverters. The cell is accessed by placing a positive voltage on the word line <b>195</b>. Data is input onto and read out of BL and BL-bar, which are provided into bit lines <b>196</b> and <b>197</b>, respectively. Voltages V<sub>SS </sub>and V<sub>DD </sub>are provided into bit lines <b>198</b> and <b>199</b>, respectively. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0065\" num=\"0065\">[0065] Since all of the \u201clinks\u201d (gate/bitline shorts) and the \u201cantilinks\u201d (removed channels) are formed prior to field programming, all of the linkable nodes do not have to be brought out of the array. This allows a 6 transistor SRAM bit cell with an area of about 80F<sup>2 </sup>to be made. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0066\" num=\"0066\">[0066] After the SRAM <b>180</b> is preprogrammed, one or more logic devices, such as inverters, NAND gates and/or NOR gates are programmed in the field by the end user. The logic devices may be programmed by EEPROM and/or antifuse programming techniques (i.e., where a link between the gate and source or drain region is formed). As shown in FIG. 8, another portion of the unprogrammed array <b>100</b> is programmed to form a 4\u00d74 inverter cell <b>143</b>. This portion may be laterally spaced from the SRAM <b>180</b> or it may be located in another device level, if the array comprises a three dimensional array. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0067\" num=\"0067\">[0067] First, a high voltage is applied between gate (i.e., word) line <b>145</b> and bit lines <b>147</b>, which will be used to carry the output voltage, V<sub>out</sub>. This causes conductive antifuse links <b>148</b> to form to electrically connect lines <b>145</b> and <b>147</b>. Then, the driver circuit provides a programming voltage to all other transistors <b>150</b> to increase their threshold voltage to turn them off, except to NMOS transistors <b>155</b> and PMOS transistors <b>157</b>. The NMOS <b>155</b> and PMOS <b>157</b> transistors form the inverter. When a high voltage, V<sub>in</sub>, is provided into gate line <b>149</b>, then a low voltage, V<sub>out</sub>, is read out, and vice-versa. Voltages V<sub>SS </sub>(i.e., ground) and V<sub>DD </sub>(i.e., power supply voltage) are provided into bit lines <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> which are connected to transistors <b>155</b> and <b>157</b>. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0068\" num=\"0068\">[0068] Thus, the array contains a plurality of TFTs with charge storage regions, some of which are programmed by mask ROM techniques, others by EEPROM techniques, while yet others are programmed by anti-fuse techniques. Thus, the array programming flexibility is increased while its cost is reduced because all the transistors in the array are the same. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0069\" num=\"0069\">[0069] In the above described preferred embodiments, the use of polysilicon layers was described. However, amorphous silicon, single crystal silicon or non-silicon semiconductor materials may be used instead. The polysilicon layers described above may be deposited as polysilicon layers by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other methods. The semiconductor layers may be in-situ doped during deposition or these layers may be doped by ion implantation or diffusion after deposition. Furthermore, the polysilicon layers, such as the channel layer, may be first deposited as amorphous silicon layers and then crystallized to form polysilicon or single crystal silicon layers. The crystallization may be carried out by laser, flash lamp and/or thermal (i.e., furnace) annealing. If desired, a transition metal or germanium crystallization catalyst material may be placed in contact with the amorphous silicon layers to increase the polysilicon grain size after the crystallization. Such transition catalyst materials may comprise nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium and other transition metals. The insulating and conductive layers described above may be deposited by any known method, such as CVD, sputtering, plating, spin-on coating (for spin-on glass), etc. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0070\" num=\"0070\">[0070] In the various embodiments described above, metal silicide layers were formed in contact with silicon layers, such as the polysilicon source and drain regions or gate electrodes. One preferred method of forming a metal silicide layer, such as a titanium silicide layer, in contact with a silicon layer is by using a silicon cap and a TiN layer. The titanium silicide layer is formed on an undoped amorphous silicon cap layer. The cap layer is formed on a heavily doped silicon layer, such as a polysilicon or amorphous silicon layer doped to a concentration in excess of 10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>\u22123</sup>, such as 10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>\u22123 </sup>to 10<sup>21 </sup>cm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The cap layer is preferably deposited on P+ polysilicon or N+ amorphous silicon layers. The N+ amorphous silicon may then be recrystallized into N+ polysilicon during subsequent annealing steps. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0071\" num=\"0071\">[0071] A method of forming a titanium silicide (TiSi<sub>2</sub>) layer comprises the following steps. A heavily doped polysilicon layer is deposited. For example, a P+ polysilicon layer is boron doped to a concentration of 5\u00d710<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>\u22123</sup>, and has a thickness of about 1400 Angstroms. A cap layer of undoped amorphous silicon is deposited on the P+ polysilicon layer. The cap may be 600 Angstroms thick, for example. A titanium layer is deposited on the cap. The titanium layer may be 250 Angstroms thick, for example. A titanium nitride layer is deposited on the titanium layer. The titanium nitride layer may be 100 Angstroms thick, for example. Other layer thicknesses may be used, as required. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0072\" num=\"0072\">[0072] The layers are annealed at a temperature below 650\u00b0 C. for less than five minutes to react the titanium and the silicon in the cap to form a C49 phase TiSi<sub>2 </sub>layer. The anneal may be carried out at 600\u00b0 C. for 1 minute, for example. If desired, another P+ polysilicon layer is deposited over the stack and the stack is etched into a thin \u201cwire\u201d or \u201crail\u201d, such as a word line or bit line. The wire or rail may be 0.25 microns wide or less. The titanium silicide is then transformed from the C49 to the C54 phase by a high temperature (i.e., above 650\u00b0 C.) anneal. The anneal can take place before or after the wires or rails are patterned, at 800\u00b0 C. for one minute, for example. By annealing each Si/Ti/TiN film stack below 650\u00b0 C., dopant diffusion and thermal grooving of the TiSi<sub>2 </sub>is minimized. Multiple film stacks can be deposited and etched sequentially. </p>\\n    <p id=\"P-0073\" num=\"0073\">[0073] The foregoing description of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.

From the figures or record thus produced, various useful data may be obtained or derived. For example, in the .case of fuel fed into a furnace, the figures or record, in conjunction with a water meter, or steam meter, will enable the evaporative values of different fuels or grades of fuel, or the heat efiiciency of the boiler to -be determined.  \\n - The graphic measurement will also show the thickness of the layer during any given delivery of the fuel.&#39; In the case of grain and the like, the numerically indicated measurement will show the total quantity delivered,  \\n while the graphic record will enable the total quantity of a given delivery, or a succession of deliveries to be readily computed. It will Specification of Letters Patent.  \\n rammed Aug. 31, 1915.  \\n Serial No. 23,171.  \\n also show the thickness of the layer of grain during such delivery or deliveries.  \\n &#39; In the conveyance or transmission of granular materials one or other of two methods is usually adopted, (1) by means which transport the material continuously, and (2) by means which transport the material intermittently, this last, named method being used in certain types of mechanical stokers.  \\n  The present invention has for its object to measure the materials while being conveyed or transmitted by either of the said methods.  \\n  For producing the numerically indicated measurement, the instrument will preferably be similar to the integrating instrument forming the subject of Letters Patent No. 1112459, or the inte frating instrument forming the subject of l3ritish Patent No. 9723 of 1909.  \\n  Upon the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 illustrates, in diagram, the application of the invention to apparatus in which the propulsion of the material to be measured is of a continuous character. Fig. 2 illustrates,  \\n in diagram, a modification of a detail part.  \\n Fig. 3 illustrates, in diagram, the measurlng instrument as adapted to produce a graphic record, or both the graphic record and the numerical indication, and also as. adapted to afford a rectifying motion should the variations in the effective Gross-sectional areas of the fuel or other layer be other than directly proportional to the movements of the regulator, and (or) to afford between the regulator and counter a motion-reducing action when the vertical movements of the regulator are large, or a motion-multiplying action when such vertical movements are small. Fig. 4 illustrates an example of a graphic record produced by the arrangement shown in-Fig. 3. Fig. 5 illustrates. in diagram, a modification of Fig. 3. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of the practical application of the invention to a mechanical stoker of the chain-grate type. Fig. 7 illustrates, in diagram, a further modification hereinafter described. Fig. 8 illustrates, in diagram, the application of the invention to apparatus in whichthe propulsion of the material to be measured is of an intermittent character.  \\n  In the following description, the term conveyer 0r distributer is intended to stand for an endless belt or chain, or a shovel or other device designed to convey or transport the material to be measured from one point to another, while the term regulator will stand for any form of device for controlling the thickness or cross sectional area of the fuel or other layer to be measured.  \\n  Referring to Fig. 1, the conveyer thereon shown is represented as an endless band 1 passing around pulleys 2, 2, while the regulator is represented as a door 3, this latter being mounted to slide vertically and to control the thickness of the granular or powdered material flowing from the hopper 4: on to the band 1.  \\n  The measuring instrument shown comprises the integrating drum 5 and a revolution counter 6, the former being driven at a speed proportional to that of the conveyer, and the latter being moved endwise and in proportion to the vertical movements of the door 3. The drum 5 may, as shown, be driven by one of the pulleys of the conveyer through bevel wheels 7, 8 and shafts 9, 10, while the counter 6 may be moved endwise by the door 3 in one direction and by a counterbalance weight 11 in the opposite direction, the door and weight being connected to the counter by cords 12 working over pulleys 13.  \\n  ll&#39;ith the lower edge of the regulator 3 parallel with the upper face of the conveyer, and with the sides of the hopper opening at right angles to the said face of the conveyer, the opening through which the material has to pass is rectangular. To measure the total quantity or cubic feet of material passing on to the conveyer it is therefore necessary to multiply the area of the said opening by the distance traversed by the material, that is to say, where an: area of opening in square feet and (Z distance in feet traversed by the conveyer, the total quantity of material delivered by the conveyer -(tXrl q cubic feet.  \\n For the purpose of affording the desired measurement mechanically, the integrating drum 5 of the instrument is driven at a speed proportional to that of the band or conveyer 1 and the curve or contour of the toothed portion of the drum is plotted to correspond with the varying areas of the said opening. Should the hopper opening be rectangular, the said curve of the drum will be a regular helix, but should the hopper opening not be rectangular, and consequently thevariation in area not be strictly pro &#39;)ortional to the lift of the door, the curve or contour of the toothed portion of the drum 5 would not be a regular helix but would be an irregular helix, as in the case of the. toothed integrating drum described in the said prior Patent No, 1112-159.  \\n  The counter (i is moved endwise to an extent proportional to the vertical movements of the door 3. Under these circumstances, therefore, and with the conveyer 1 in motion, the door 3 raised, and material passing from the hopper on to the conveyer, the counter 6 will automatically count up the total quantty or cubic feet of material that has passec through the hopper opening and has been transported by the conveyer. lVith the width of hopper opening constant, the integration will only require to be in respect to the thickness or cross sectional area of the fuel or other layer, and the distance traveled by the conveyer.  \\n  When the door 3 is at its lowest position and no material is passing, even although the conveyer may still be in motion, or alternatively, when the door 3 is fully open and the conveyer is stopped, no motion will be imparted to the wheels of the counter, while under all other intermediate conditions as to the area of the hopper opening and the speed of the conveyer, the motion of the wheels of the counter will be proportional to the amount of material delivered on to the conveyer.  \\n  Inlieu of using the toothed integrating drum 5, a friction integrating disk 14 may be used, see Fig. 2, the disk being rotated in sympathy with the conveyer &#34;through say bevel wheels 15 and shaft 10. The driving wheel 16 of the counter 6 will rest upon the face of the disk, and, with the endwise movements of the counter, will slide over the top face of the disk and take up various positions according to the degree, or area of the hopper opening, the wheel lying over the center of the disk when the door is closed and near to the periphery of the disk when the door is fully opened.  \\n  lVhen it is required to give a graphic record, instead of the numerical indication, the instrument may comprise a drum 17, see Fig. 3, similar to the motion-rectifying drum described in the specification of Patent 815102. It may also comprise a pen-carrying arm 18, and a chart-carrying drum 19, the chart paper being in the form of a roll of paper carried upon a roller 20, the drum being provided with pins engaging holes in the edges of the paper. The chart&#34; paper will be ruled with longitudinal lines representing various heights of the door, or (and) various areas of hopper opening, and with transverse lines representing divisions of lineal measurement.  \\n The drum 19 will be driven by shaft 10. at  \\n  a speed proportional to that of the conveyer, while the drum 17 will be rotated by irregular helix accordingas the variations in the drum 17 will be &#39;rotated and caused to move the pen a distance proportional to the movement of the door or otherwise.  \\n When the hopper door is opened, the drum 17 will be rotated and caused to move the pen a distance proportional to the area of the hopper opening, While with the conveyer and drum 19 set in motion, the pen will mark upon the chart paper a line representing the thickness, or cross-sectional area of the layer of material, and the distance traversed by such material. An example of a graphic record thus obtained -is shown in Fig. 4, the heavy line indicating that the layer of material was 3 inches thick for 100 feet-of traverse, 2 inches thick for feet of traverse, and 1 inch thick for 50 feet of traverse. Or, assuming the hopper opening is 2 feet wide and the door raised 3 inches, thus giving an area of 0.5 square feet, the graphic record will show that in the first 100 feet of traverse 50 cubic feet of material were delivered; with the door lowered to 2 inches thus giving &#39;an area of 0.333 of a square foo-t, the graphic record will show that in the next 70 feet of traverse 23.31 cubic feet of material were delivered, while with the door lowered to 1 inch, thus giving an area of 0.16 square feet, the graphic record will show that in the next 50 feet of traverse 8.33 cubic feet of material were delivered. From the diagram thus produced, the area of which represents the total cubic&#39;feet of material delivered, .the total quantity may be readily computed with the aid of a planimeter.  \\n  When both a numerical indication and a graphic record are required the instrument will also comprise the integrating drum 5 and the counter 6, this latter being mounted upon and moving endwise with the rod 24, while the drum 5 is rotated from the drum 19 by pulleys 19 and endless chain 19&#34;.  \\n When the area of the hopper openings are the pen and counter relatively to those of the door 3, which may be large or small.  \\n Should the hopper opening be purely rectangular, the drum 17 may be dispensed with and the pen and counter moved directly by the door 3 and weight 11 in the same way as the counter is moved in Fig. 1. Similarly, when only a graphic record is required, the pen may be moved endwise by the direct action of the door 3. and weight 11, see Fig. 5.  \\n  Referring now to Fig. 6, which illustrates the invention applied to a mechanical stoker of the chain-grate type, the measuring instrument is mounted within a dustproof casing&#39;26, secured say by plate 27 to the fuel hopper 28; The counter 6 is mounted upon a rod 29 slidably mounted in bearings 30. As in the prior invention, the driving wheel of the counter is adapted to mesh with the teeth of the drum 5, the weight of the counter being counter-balanced and a rail behind the rod 29 serving to hold the wheel lightly in mesh with the teeth of the drum. The motion of the endless grate 31 is transmitted to the drum 5 by means of bevel wheels 32, 33 and a flexible shaft 34, this latter being coupled to an extension 35 of the drum axle 5 bevel wheel 32 is keyed upon the usual worm driving shaft 36 of the chain grate. The rod 29 is coupled to an extension 37, which latter, at the end outside the casing, is  \\n adjustably linked to one arm of the usual furnace door-raising lever 38. This same arm at its free end engages a nut 38 on the screwed spindle 39. The lever 38 is secured to the shaft 40, which passes through the hopper, and on the other side of the hopper is fitted with a lever arm, to which and the lever 38, by links 41, is connected the furnace door 3. By rotating the screw spindle 39, the door 3&#39; is raised or lowered, while the counter is moved endwise to an extent proportional to the vertical movements of the door. Further, by regulating the height of the door the thickness of the fuel layer on the grate is regulated.  \\n  With the rotary movements of the drum 5 proportional to the velocity of the grate and the curve of the drum plotted to different heights of the furnace door, or areas of the opening, and also with the counter held in a position corresponding proportionately to the height of the door, or the thickness of the fuel layer on the grate, the instrument serves to automatically measure and indicate numerically the total quantity of cubic feet of fuel delivered into the furnace. When the graphic record is also required,  \\n The  \\n the chart drum 19 and roller 20 are arranged within the same casing and the drum 19 is driven at the same speed as the drum 5 through the medium of the endless chain 12 and pulleys 4:3. The pen carrying arm 18 is mounted upon the rod 29 and is thus moved endwise simultaneously and at the same rate as the counter 6.  \\n As described in the said prior Patent No.  \\n 1,112,459 and shown in Fig. 7, the. counter 6 may be stationary, and the movements of the toothed drum be transmitted to the counter mechanism through a small pinion 16 suitably shaped and arranged to mesh with the toothed drum 5, and a further and long pinion 16, the axle of this latter carrying a worm 16 gearing with a worm wheel in the counter. The pinion 16 will always be in mesh with the pinion 16&#34;, and the rod 3, upon which the pinion 16 1s free to rotate while held against endwise movement by collars 16, will be connected to the door 3, and thus, as thedoor is raised or lowered, 15 will move the pinion 16 to the requ1red \\\\positions for measuring the materlal. The  \\n drum 5 will be rotated from the conveyor shaft through bevel wheels 7, 8 and 8 and shafts 9 and 10 as shown. 20 While shown applied to a chain grate type of stoker, it will be readily understood that the invention may be applied to mechanical stokers of the shovel type, see Fig. 8. In this case the drum 5 will be rotated in sympathy with the intermittent forward movements of&#39;the shovel 44, and the adjustments for varying the stroke of the pusher or ram 45, by which latter the supply of fuel is regulated, will be used to move the counter to the required positions representing the effective sectional areas of the stream of fuel transmitted to the furnace. In the example shown the fulcrum of the ram operating lever 46 is supported by an adjustable bracket 47, and the lever is slotted, so that on raising or lowering the fulcrum, the stroke of the ram is varied. The counter (or rod 3) &#39;of the instrument is connected by a cord 48 working around pulleys 49, to the bracket 47, and thus, with the adjustments of the bracket, and under the pull of the weight 50, the counter (or pinion 16 is held in the correct position for the stroke of the ram, which multiplied by the width of the ram in plan represents the cross sectional area, or thickness of the fuel delivered to the&#39;furnace.  \\n What I claim is 1.

A Patented Aug. 31, 1915. </p>\\n<p>5 SHEETS-SHEET 5. </p>\\n<p> W Q A III/MAX!- To all whom it may concern: </p>\\n<p>JAMES EDWARD LEA, 0F MANCHESTER, ENGLAND. </p>\\n<p>APPARATUS FOR MEASURING GRANULAR 0R POWDERED MATERIALS. </p>\\n<p>Application filed April 22,1915. </p>\\n<p> Be it known that I, JAMES EDWARD LEA, a subject of the King of Great Britain and Ireland, and resident of Manchester, England, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in and Relating to Apparatus for Measuring Granular or Powdered Materials, of which the following is a specification. </p>\\n<p> This invention refers to and consists of a new or improved arrangement and combination of mechanism for automatically effecting the volumetric measurement of substances or materials in granular or powdered form. </p>\\n<p> The invention relates, in\\' particular, to the volumetric measurement of such substances or materials delivered through an orifice or opening under the control of a regulator and while being carried forward or transported by a conveyer or distributer. </p>\\n<p> One of the uses of. the invention will be in the volumetric measurement of fuel fed into a furnace by a mechanical stoker, while another use will be in the like measurement of grain delivered from a chute or hopper on to an endless conveyer. </p>\\n<p> Other uses of the invention will be in the volumetric measurement of materials such as salt, flour, sand, stone and the like. </p>\\n<p> The object of the invention is to effect the desired measurement automatically by means of an integrating measuring instrument which is actuated in sympathy with the movements of the said conveyer or distributer and subject to the control of the regulator, the measurement being indicated either numerically or graphically, or both. From the figures or record thus produced, various useful data may be obtained or derived. For example, in the .case of fuel fed into a furnace, the figures or record, in conjunction with a water meter, or steam meter, will enable the evaporative values of different fuels or grades of fuel, or the heat efiiciency of the boiler to -be determined. </p>\\n<p>- The graphic measurement will also show the thickness of the layer during any given delivery of the fuel.\\' In the case of grain and the like, the numerically indicated measurement will show the total quantity delivered, </p>\\n<p>while the graphic record will enable the total quantity of a given delivery, or a succession of deliveries to be readily computed. It will Specification of Letters Patent. </p>\\n<p>rammed Aug. 31, 1915. </p>\\n<p>Serial No. 23,171. </p>\\n<p>also show the thickness of the layer of grain during such delivery or deliveries. </p>\\n<p>\\' In the conveyance or transmission of granular materials one or other of two methods is usually adopted, (1) by means which transport the material continuously, and (2) by means which transport the material intermittently, this last, named method being used in certain types of mechanical stokers. </p>\\n<p> The present invention has for its object to measure the materials while being conveyed or transmitted by either of the said methods. </p>\\n<p> For producing the numerically indicated measurement, the instrument will preferably be similar to the integrating instrument forming the subject of Letters Patent No. 1112459, or the inte frating instrument forming the subject of l3ritish Patent No. 9723 of 1909. </p>\\n<p> Upon the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 illustrates, in diagram, the application of the invention to apparatus in which the propulsion of the material to be measured is of a continuous character. Fig. 2 illustrates, </p>\\n<p>in diagram, a modification of a detail part. </p>\\n<p>Fig. 3 illustrates, in diagram, the measurlng instrument as adapted to produce a graphic record, or both the graphic record and the numerical indication, and also as. adapted to afford a rectifying motion should the variations in the effective Gross-sectional areas of the fuel or other layer be other than directly proportional to the movements of the regulator, and (or) to afford between the regulator and counter a motion-reducing action when the vertical movements of the regulator are large, or a motion-multiplying action when such vertical movements are small. Fig. 4 illustrates an example of a graphic record produced by the arrangement shown in-Fig. 3. Fig. 5 illustrates. in diagram, a modification of Fig. 3. Fig. 6 illustrates an example of the practical application of the invention to a mechanical stoker of the chain-grate type. Fig. 7 illustrates, in diagram, a further modification hereinafter described. Fig. 8 illustrates, in diagram, the application of the invention to apparatus in whichthe propulsion of the material to be measured is of an intermittent character. </p>\\n<p> In the following description, the term conveyer 0r distributer is intended to stand for an endless belt or chain, or a shovel or other device designed to convey or transport the material to be measured from one point to another, while the term regulator will stand for any form of device for controlling the thickness or cross sectional area of the fuel or other layer to be measured. </p>\\n<p> Referring to Fig. 1, the conveyer thereon shown is represented as an endless band 1 passing around pulleys 2, 2, while the regulator is represented as a door 3, this latter being mounted to slide vertically and to control the thickness of the granular or powdered material flowing from the hopper 4: on to the band 1. </p>\\n<p> The measuring instrument shown comprises the integrating drum 5 and a revolution counter 6, the former being driven at a speed proportional to that of the conveyer, and the latter being moved endwise and in proportion to the vertical movements of the door 3. The drum 5 may, as shown, be driven by one of the pulleys of the conveyer through bevel wheels 7, 8 and shafts 9, 10, while the counter 6 may be moved endwise by the door 3 in one direction and by a counterbalance weight 11 in the opposite direction, the door and weight being connected to the counter by cords 12 working over pulleys 13. </p>\\n<p> ll\\'ith the lower edge of the regulator 3 parallel with the upper face of the conveyer, and with the sides of the hopper opening at right angles to the said face of the conveyer, the opening through which the material has to pass is rectangular. To measure the total quantity or cubic feet of material passing on to the conveyer it is therefore necessary to multiply the area of the said opening by the distance traversed by the material, that is to say, where an: area of opening in square feet and (Z distance in feet traversed by the conveyer, the total quantity of material delivered by the conveyer -(tXrl q cubic feet. </p>\\n<p>For the purpose of affording the desired measurement mechanically, the integrating drum 5 of the instrument is driven at a speed proportional to that of the band or conveyer 1 and the curve or contour of the toothed portion of the drum is plotted to correspond with the varying areas of the said opening. Should the hopper opening be rectangular, the said curve of the drum will be a regular helix, but should the hopper opening not be rectangular, and consequently thevariation in area not be strictly pro \\')ortional to the lift of the door, the curve or contour of the toothed portion of the drum 5 would not be a regular helix but would be an irregular helix, as in the case of the. toothed integrating drum described in the said prior Patent No, 1112-159. </p>\\n<p> The counter (i is moved endwise to an extent proportional to the vertical movements of the door 3. Under these circumstances, therefore, and with the conveyer 1 in motion, the door 3 raised, and material passing from the hopper on to the conveyer, the counter 6 will automatically count up the total quantty or cubic feet of material that has passec through the hopper opening and has been transported by the conveyer. lVith the width of hopper opening constant, the integration will only require to be in respect to the thickness or cross sectional area of the fuel or other layer, and the distance traveled by the conveyer. </p>\\n<p> When the door 3 is at its lowest position and no material is passing, even although the conveyer may still be in motion, or alternatively, when the door 3 is fully open and the conveyer is stopped, no motion will be imparted to the wheels of the counter, while under all other intermediate conditions as to the area of the hopper opening and the speed of the conveyer, the motion of the wheels of the counter will be proportional to the amount of material delivered on to the conveyer. </p>\\n<p> Inlieu of using the toothed integrating drum 5, a friction integrating disk 14 may be used, see Fig. 2, the disk being rotated in sympathy with the conveyer \"through say bevel wheels 15 and shaft 10. The driving wheel 16 of the counter 6 will rest upon the face of the disk, and, with the endwise movements of the counter, will slide over the top face of the disk and take up various positions according to the degree, or area of the hopper opening, the wheel lying over the center of the disk when the door is closed and near to the periphery of the disk when the door is fully opened. </p>\\n<p> lVhen it is required to give a graphic record, instead of the numerical indication, the instrument may comprise a drum 17, see Fig. 3, similar to the motion-rectifying drum described in the specification of Patent 815102. It may also comprise a pen-carrying arm 18, and a chart-carrying drum 19, the chart paper being in the form of a roll of paper carried upon a roller 20, the drum being provided with pins engaging holes in the edges of the paper. The chart\" paper will be ruled with longitudinal lines representing various heights of the door, or (and) various areas of hopper opening, and with transverse lines representing divisions of lineal measurement. </p>\\n<p>The drum 19 will be driven by shaft 10. at </p>\\n<p> a speed proportional to that of the conveyer, while the drum 17 will be rotated by irregular helix accordingas the variations in the drum 17 will be \\'rotated and caused to move the pen a distance proportional to the movement of the door or otherwise. </p>\\n<p>When the hopper door is opened, the drum 17 will be rotated and caused to move the pen a distance proportional to the area of the hopper opening, While with the conveyer and drum 19 set in motion, the pen will mark upon the chart paper a line representing the thickness, or cross-sectional area of the layer of material, and the distance traversed by such material. An example of a graphic record thus obtained -is shown in Fig. 4, the heavy line indicating that the layer of material was 3 inches thick for 100 feet-of traverse, 2 inches thick for feet of traverse, and 1 inch thick for 50 feet of traverse. Or, assuming the hopper opening is 2 feet wide and the door raised 3 inches, thus giving an area of 0.5 square feet, the graphic record will show that in the first 100 feet of traverse 50 cubic feet of material were delivered; with the door lowered to 2 inches thus giving \\'an area of 0.333 of a square foo-t, the graphic record will show that in the next 70 feet of traverse 23.31 cubic feet of material were delivered, while with the door lowered to 1 inch, thus giving an area of 0.16 square feet, the graphic record will show that in the next 50 feet of traverse 8.33 cubic feet of material were delivered. From the diagram thus produced, the area of which represents the total cubic\\'feet of material delivered, .the total quantity may be readily computed with the aid of a planimeter. </p>\\n<p> When both a numerical indication and a graphic record are required the instrument will also comprise the integrating drum 5 and the counter 6, this latter being mounted upon and moving endwise with the rod 24, while the drum 5 is rotated from the drum 19 by pulleys 19 and endless chain 19\". </p>\\n<p>When the area of the hopper openings are the pen and counter relatively to those of the door 3, which may be large or small. </p>\\n<p>Should the hopper opening be purely rectangular, the drum 17 may be dispensed with and the pen and counter moved directly by the door 3 and weight 11 in the same way as the counter is moved in Fig. 1. Similarly, when only a graphic record is required, the pen may be moved endwise by the direct action of the door 3. and weight 11, see Fig. 5. </p>\\n<p> Referring now to Fig. 6, which illustrates the invention applied to a mechanical stoker of the chain-grate type, the measuring instrument is mounted within a dustproof casing\\'26, secured say by plate 27 to the fuel hopper 28; The counter 6 is mounted upon a rod 29 slidably mounted in bearings 30. As in the prior invention, the driving wheel of the counter is adapted to mesh with the teeth of the drum 5, the weight of the counter being counter-balanced and a rail behind the rod 29 serving to hold the wheel lightly in mesh with the teeth of the drum. The motion of the endless grate 31 is transmitted to the drum 5 by means of bevel wheels 32, 33 and a flexible shaft 34, this latter being coupled to an extension 35 of the drum axle 5 bevel wheel 32 is keyed upon the usual worm driving shaft 36 of the chain grate. The rod 29 is coupled to an extension 37, which latter, at the end outside the casing, is </p>\\n<p>adjustably linked to one arm of the usual furnace door-raising lever 38. This same arm at its free end engages a nut 38 on the screwed spindle 39. The lever 38 is secured to the shaft 40, which passes through the hopper, and on the other side of the hopper is fitted with a lever arm, to which and the lever 38, by links 41, is connected the furnace door 3. By rotating the screw spindle 39, the door 3\\' is raised or lowered, while the counter is moved endwise to an extent proportional to the vertical movements of the door. Further, by regulating the height of the door the thickness of the fuel layer on the grate is regulated. </p>\\n<p> With the rotary movements of the drum 5 proportional to the velocity of the grate and the curve of the drum plotted to different heights of the furnace door, or areas of the opening, and also with the counter held in a position corresponding proportionately to the height of the door, or the thickness of the fuel layer on the grate, the instrument serves to automatically measure and indicate numerically the total quantity of cubic feet of fuel delivered into the furnace. When the graphic record is also required, </p>\\n<p>The </p>\\n<p>the chart drum 19 and roller 20 are arranged within the same casing and the drum 19 is driven at the same speed as the drum 5 through the medium of the endless chain 12 and pulleys 4:3. The pen carrying arm 18 is mounted upon the rod 29 and is thus moved endwise simultaneously and at the same rate as the counter 6. </p>\\n<p>As described in the said prior Patent No. </p>\\n<p>1,112,459 and shown in Fig. 7, the. counter 6 may be stationary, and the movements of the toothed drum be transmitted to the counter mechanism through a small pinion 16 suitably shaped and arranged to mesh with the toothed drum 5, and a further and long pinion 16, the axle of this latter carrying a worm 16 gearing with a worm wheel in the counter. The pinion 16 will always be in mesh with the pinion 16\", and the rod 3, upon which the pinion 16 1s free to rotate while held against endwise movement by collars 16, will be connected to the door 3, and thus, as thedoor is raised or lowered, 15 will move the pinion 16 to the requ1red \\\\positions for measuring the materlal. The </p>\\n<p>drum 5 will be rotated from the conveyor shaft through bevel wheels 7, 8 and 8 and shafts 9 and 10 as shown. 20 While shown applied to a chain grate type of stoker, it will be readily understood that the invention may be applied to mechanical stokers of the shovel type, see Fig. 8. In this case the drum 5 will be rotated in sympathy with the intermittent forward movements of\\'the shovel 44, and the adjustments for varying the stroke of the pusher or ram 45, by which latter the supply of fuel is regulated, will be used to move the counter to the required positions representing the effective sectional areas of the stream of fuel transmitted to the furnace. In the example shown the fulcrum of the ram operating lever 46 is supported by an adjustable bracket 47, and the lever is slotted, so that on raising or lowering the fulcrum, the stroke of the ram is varied. The counter (or rod 3) \\'of the instrument is connected by a cord 48 working around pulleys 49, to the bracket 47, and thus, with the adjustments of the bracket, and under the pull of the weight 50, the counter (or pinion 16 is held in the correct position for the stroke of the ram, which multiplied by the width of the ram in plan represents the cross sectional area, or thickness of the fuel delivered to the\\'furnace. </p>\\n<p>What I claim is 1.
