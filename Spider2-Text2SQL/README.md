# Spider2-Text2SQL

Spider2-Text2SQL is a realistic and challenging Text-to-SQL dataset, significantly more difficult and closer to real-world scenarios than any previous Text2SQL benchmarks.
- Enterprise and industrial grade databases covering various fields with super complex schema. Each database has many tables, each table has many columns.
- Various types of databases, ranging from local DBs (SQLite, DuckDB, Postgres) to large cloud DBs(Bigquery,Snowflake).
- Extremely realistic and complex SQL generation tasks, collected and rewrited from real websites, forums, and tutorials.
- Writing advanced and real-world industrial SQL. Beyond extensive use of SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN operations, it also requires incorporating various external knowledge, SQL dialects, special functions, and more.
