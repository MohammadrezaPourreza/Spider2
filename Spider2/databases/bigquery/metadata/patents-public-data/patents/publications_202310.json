(Cl. 103-173) This invention relates to hydraulic pumps and, more particularly, to a hydraulic pump of the rotary type.  \\n  Recent advances in hydraulic system designs have necessitated the provision of hydraulicfluid under high pressures for the actuation of various types of hydraulically actuable instruments and devices, necessitating the provision of a pump characterized by high pressure delivery, high speed operation, relatively large volume output and, yet, of exceedingly small size and light weight. It is, therefore, a primary object of my invention to provide a hydraulic pump which is capable of maintaining a relatively large volume of hydraulic fluid under constant high pressure, the flow of fluid from said pump being substantially constant and being relatively free from heavy surge, pulsation, and high pressure peaks.  \\n  In order to achieve the aforementioned desirable results of large output and high pressure in a relatively small envelope, it is necessary that the component parts of the pump be energized at relatively high speed. When conventional pumps are utilized, the centrifugal force induced in the component portions thereof by such high speed results in rapid wear of the pump, necessitating the frequent dismantling thereof and the replacement of worn parts. t  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a high speed, large volume, high pressure pump in which the various components are so balanced that excessive bearing loads encountered in conventional pumps are eliminated, thus obviating the necessity for replacement of worn parts and for frequent dismantling of the pump.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of a high speed, high pressure pump which includes a plurality of reciprocating pistons, said pistons being actuable by a rotatable drive member associated therewith. An associated object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character in which the rotatable drive member is provided with a cam portion adapted to cause the reciprocation of said pistons.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which there is provided a plurality of banks of cylinders which are spaced from each other, said pump including a plurality of pumping members having provided at their opposite ends pistons adapted to be reciprocated in opposed cylinders of said banks.  \\n Another object of my invention is the provision of l a pump having a plurality of spaced banks of opposed cylinders adapted to receive oppositely directed pistons provided upon a plurality of pumping members which are actuable by a rotary cam, the rotation of said cam causing the movement of said pumping members and the reciprocation of said pistons in said cylinders.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which said pumping members, in additionto being reciprocable to cause the reciprocation of said pistons, are rotatable about their axes by&#39;therotation of saidvcam, the concomitant rotation ofthe cam and the&#39;pumping members 2,925,047 Patented 16, 1960 causing the rotation of said pistons, which serve as journals for the members, to prevent the occurrence of hot spots or hot bands frequently encountered in closely fitted bearings and reducing frictional wear between the pistons and the cylinders in which they both rotate and reciprocate.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the drive cam is so generated that four strokes of each pumping memher are achieved during one revolution of the drive cam. Therefore, excessive pressure surge and pulsations are eliminated at the output of the pump since, in a pump containing seven pumping members, twenty-eight strokes per revolution occur and the pump can operate at speeds exceeding 8000 r.p.m.  \\n  An additional object&#39;of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the positive reciprocation of the pumping members in both directions of movement by the drive cam eliminates the necessity for return devices, such as springs, thus insuring the positive reciprocation of the pumping members and eliminating the possibility that the pumping members may become jammed because of the failure of the return devices.  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the reaction loads of the pumping members on the cam drive are substantially reduced by the symmetrical configuration of the cam which results in substantial dynamic balance of the cam loads axially and radially.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the drive member is provided with a plurality of valve means adapted to control the flow of inlet fluid to the opposed cylinders of opposite banks, the rotation of said drive member causing the concomitant rotation of said valve means.  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the fluid inlet to the cylinders is controlled by the aforesaid valve means and the discharge from each cylinder is controlled by a poppet valve, resulting in minimum inlet restriction and minimum leakage perimeter of the rotary valve.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type which, because of its cylinder construction and pumping member actuation, causes the cylinder pressure to be gradually elevated to equal the system pressure, thus reducing hydraulic shock and noise.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of an inlet booster adjacent the inlet passage of the pump which pressurizes the inlet fluid prior to its passage into the cylinders of the pump. t  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which inlet line and delivery line surge are reduced to a minimum because of the constant output characteristic of the pump and because of the double acting pumping members provided therein.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character which is provided with a centrally located cam chamber, said cam chamber being adapted to receive fluid under pressure which serves to equalize the temperature between various &#34;portions of the pump.  \\n member which is engageable by a plurality of pumping members, the pumping members being provided with different configurations so that they engage the driving member in different contact zones to reduce the wear on the driving member.  \\n  acaaow A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump wherein the driving member has a spherically generated drive cam surface provided thereon, said cam surface being engageable by pumping members having spherically generated cam followers provided thereupon, and the contours of the spherically generated cam followers are selected from different segments of a sphere to distribute the load and wear across said drive cam surface. j  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character wherein the valve means for each of the various cylinders includes an inlet poppet valve located at the inlet end of the cylinder and operable by a pressure differential created across said inlet end. The provision of inlet poppet valves materially reduces the unswept volume of the cylinders which results with rotary valve constructions and improves the self-priming characteristics of the pump.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a simple but dependable poppet valve structure which can be readily assembled and which insures dependable operation at high speeds.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump which is operable at high speeds and which can thus be directly driven fromthe high speed generator and other accessory pads on an aircraft engine or from a high speed electric motor, without the necessity of interposing speed reduction means.  \\n  Another object of my invention is the provision of a power unit which includes a drive motor mounted in a housing and a pump adapted to be driven thereby and located within the armature of said motor.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type which is provided with a first motor housing, said first motor housing including a motor armature and having one end adapted to receive a pump housing, said pump housing being partially encompassed by said armature.  \\n  An additional object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type in which a wholly enclosed drive is provided at the end of the motor housing opposite the end in which the pump is mounted, thus providing a completely enclosed power unit and eliminating the necessary for external drive connections between the pump and motor.  \\n  A further object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type in which the pump component thereof is readily removable from its driven relationship with the motor.  \\n  Other objects and advantages of my invention will be apparent from the following specification and the accompanying drawings which are for the purpose of illustration only and in which:  \\n  Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of a pump constructed in accordance with my invention and taken on the broken line 11 of Fig. 2;  \\n  Fig. 2 is a transverse, partly sectional view taken on the broken line 22 of Fig. 1;  \\n Fig. 3 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 3-3 of Fig. 1;.  \\n  Fig. 4 is an enlarged, partlysectional view taken on the broken line 44 of Fig. 1;  \\n  Fig. 5 is an enlarged side elevational view of a valve constructed in accordance with my invention;  \\n  Fig. 6 is a vertical sectional view illustrating another embodiment of my invention and taken on the broken line 66 of Fig. 7;  \\n  Fig. 7 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 7-7 of Fig. 6;  \\n  Fig. 8 is a transverse, reduced, partly sectional view taken on the broken line 8,8 of Fig. 6;  \\n  Fig. 9 is an enlarged, fragmentary, partly sectional view of one of the discharge check valves incorporated in the pump of my invention;  \\n Fig. 10 is a transverse, fragmentary, enlarged, partly 4 sectional view taken on the broken line 10-10 of Fig. 7;  \\n  Fig. 11 is a vertical sectional view of still another embodiment of my invention;  \\n  Fig. 12 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 12--12 of Fig. 11;  \\n  Fig. 13 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view taken on the line 13-13 of Fig. 11;  \\n Fig. 14 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view of i a valve means of my invention;  \\n  Fig. 15 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view taken on the broken line 1515 of Fig. 14;  \\n  Fig. 16 is an enlarged, transverse, sectional view taken on the broken line 16-16 of Fig. 15;  \\n  Fig. 17 is a perspective view of a spring seat constructed in accordance with my invention;  \\n  Fig. 18 shows a spherical configuration of the cam followers on certain of the pumping members;  \\n  Fig. 19 shows a different spherical configuration of the cam followers on other of the pumping members than Fig. 18;  \\n  Fig. 20 shows still a different spherical configuration of the cam followers on other of the pumping members than Figs. 18 and 19;  \\n  Fig. 21 is a development of the drive cam showing the relation of the various follower contact zones there- Fig. 22 is a vertical sectional view of still another embodiment of my invention; and v Fig. 23 is a partly sectional, partly elevational view of a power unit constructed in accordance with my invention.  \\n  Referring to the drawings, and more particularly to Figspl through 5 thereof, I show a pump 10, said pump being enclosed in a substantially cylindrical housing indicated generally at 11. The housing 11 is constituted by a plurality of sections which are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of elongated bolts 13 which pass through all of said sections to maintain them in the aforesaid operative relationship, as best shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings.  \\n  Among the sections constituting the pump housing 11 are a combined end plate and mounting flange 14 (which, in addition to other functions to be described in greater detail below, serves to mount the pump 10), a booster plate 16 juxtaposed to said end plate, a first stator plate 18maintained in operative relationship with said booster plate 16, a cam chamber housing 20 interposed between said first stator plate 18 and a second stator plate 22, and an end plate 23 juxtaposed to said second stator plate 22. Mounted centrally of the pump housing 11 and having its longitudinal axis substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of saidhousing is a drive shaft 25, said shaft having a splined outer end 26 engageable by a driving member, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. Keyed to the drive shaft 25 by means of a shear pin 28 is a hollow rotor 30, said rotor being formed concentrically with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and being rotatable thereby. An oil seal combination 32 prevents the leakage of oil past the end of the drive shaft 25.  \\n An inlet port 35 provided by the end plate 14 com-.  \\n  municates with a supercharger or booster chamber 36,  \\n also provided in the end plate 14. A centrifugal type booster impeller 38 located in the chamber 36 is keyed to the end of the drive shaft 25 and is rotatable thereby. The provision of the booster chamber 36 and the booster impeller 38 materially enhances the efficiency of the pump 10 since it insures constant delivery of fluid under constant pressure to the pump. Furthermore, at. high altitudes, where pressure drops are encountered, it prevents the starving of the pump. In addition, the pressure boost self-primes the&#39;pump and renders it more efiective on dry-line starting.  \\n  It should be noted here that the booster chamber 36 constitutes a portionof a fluid inlet passage 40 of the pump. The supercharger or booster plate 16, is provided with a centrally located opening 42, said opening being adapted to receive a cylindrical boss or projection 43 formed on the left-hand sidejof the first stator 18, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, to facilitate the mounting and centering of the booster plate 16. Formed in the booster plate 16 are channels 44 which constitute continuations of the inlet passage 40 and communicate with the booster chamber 36 and a first inlet chamber 48 provided in the first stator plate 18. The booster plate 16 has a centrally located opening 49 in which is located a bushing 50 which serves as a bearing for the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 38.  \\n  When the hollow rotor 30 is mounted upon the drive shaft 25, an annular, elongated inlet channel 52 exists between the periphery of the drive shaft 25 and the hollow interior of the rotor 30. This annular, elongated inlet channel 52 constitutes a prolongation of the inlet passage 40 and is adapted to receive inlet fluid from the first inlet chamber 48 as it is fed thereinto from the channels 44 in the booster plate 16. The inlet fluid flows through the elongated inlet channel 52 between the drive shaft 25 and the interior of the rotor 30 into a second inlet chamber 54.  \\n  Formed integrally with the opposite ends of the rotor 30 are first and second valve means 62 and 64 which are located and rotatable in the first and second inlet chambers 48 and 54. Therefore, when the rotor 30 is rotated by the concomitant rotation of the drive shaft 25, thefirst and second valve means 62 and 64 are simultaneous- 1y rotated in the first and second inlet chambers 48 and 54, respectively.  \\n  Communicating with the first inlet chamber 48 is, a first outlet passage 66 which, in turn, communicates with an outlet channel 67 which terminates in an outlet port 68 provided in the end plate 14. A second outlet passage 70 has one end in communication with the second inlet chamber 54 and its opposite end in communication with the outlet channel 67. A plurality of cylinders 72, as best shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings, is provided in the first stator plate 18, said cylinders being arranged about the perimeter of a circle concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and having their right-hand ends, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, communicating with a cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 73 provided in the interior of the cam chamber housing 20. Each of the cylinders 72 communicates, at its left-hand end, with a chamber 74, each of the chambers 74 being maintained in communication with the first inlet chamber 48 by means of a passage 75. The cylinders 72 constitute a first bank a of cylinders to which fluid is fed from the first inlet chamber 48 by the first valve means 62, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below.  \\n  The second stator plate 22 is provided with a plurality of cylinders 78 which are also arranged about the perimeter of a circle whose center is concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25, each of the cylinders 78 communicating at its left-hand end with the cam chamber 73 and at its right-hand end with a cylinder chamber 80 which is maintained in communication with the second inlet chamber 54 by means of a passage 81. The cylinders 78 constitute a second bank of cylinders, inlet fluid being fed to the cylinders from the second inlet chamber 54 through the passages 81 by the second valve means 64, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below.  \\n  Each of the cylinder chambers 74 associated with the cylinders 72 of the first bank and each of the cylinder chambers 80 associated with the cylinders 78 of the second bank is provided with a steel plug 83 and retained in position by means of a set screw 84. These plugs prevent the egress of fluid from the cylinder chambers d 80 an y be rsmsYedte Per i e mitt of the cylinder chambers 74 and and the passages 75 and 81 associated therewith. 1 Formed integrally with the. rotor 30 and disposed in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 73 is a rotatable driving member 85 having a cam 86, said cam being operatively engaged with a plurality of pumping members 88 which are also disposed in the chamber 73. The rotatable cam 86 includes first and second cam portions 90 and 91, defining a groove, each of which is provided with at least two rises 92 and two falls 93, the undulated rises 92 on the second cam portion 91, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, being disposed opposite the undulated falls 93 on the first cam portion 90. It should be noted that the cam portions 90 and 91 of the rotatable cam 86 are spherically generated on a circle indicated at 94, for a purpose which will be described in greater detail below. Each of the pumping members 88 includes a substantially cylindrical head portion 95 which has integrally formed therewith, at opposite ends thereof, enlarged cam follower lobes 97 and 98 which are provided with spherically generated beveled cam follower portions 99 and 100, respectively, engaging, respectively, the spherically generated cam portions 90 and 91 provided on the rotatable cam 86.  \\n  When the drive shaft 25 is rotated to cause the concomitant rotation of the rotor 30, the cam 86 is simultaneously rotated and the cam portions 90 and 91 move against the cam follower portions 99 and 100 of the cam follower lobes 97 and 98 thus causing the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88. The significance of the spherically generated engaging cam and cam follower surfaces of. the rotatable cam 86 and the cam lobes 97 and 98 at once becomes apparent since the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 causes not only the reciprocation of the pumping member 88 but also the concomitant rotation thereof and thereby preventing seizure and malfunction of piston bearings 102 and 104 which can occur on such closely fitted parts due to localized heat bands. The above mentioned reciprocation and concomitant rotation of the bearing surfaces prevents the generation of localized high temperature spots or bands by dissipating the latter over large areas of the bearing surface.  \\n  It should be noted here that the provision of the rotatable drive cam 86 with at least two rises 92 and two falls 93 on each of the first and second cam portions 90 and 91 causes each of the pumping members to be reciprocated four times during a single rotation of the rotatable cam 86, thus providing for double acting pumping members and also accomplishing an effective pumping action during rotation of the drive shaft 25. Therefore, when the pump is driven at 8,000 rpm, 32,000 strokes per minute of each of the seven pumping members occur, resulting in a fluid output characterized by the almost total absence of pulsation and pressure surges.  \\n  Another aspect of the simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88 by the rotatable drive cam 86 through the inter-engagement of the spherically generated cam and cam follower surfaces thereof is the fact that high speed rotation of the drive shaft 25 is permitted and facilitated which would not be the case if the inter-engagement between the rotatable cam 86 and the pumping members 88 were a conventional rubbing cam inter-engagement since the high speeds of the drive shaft 25 would cause not only tremendous frictional losses between the drive cam 86 and the pumping members 88, but would also cause such great Wear that the cam and its associated pumping members would have a relatively short useful life. The engagement between the drive cam 86 and the cam follower portions 99 and of the pumping members 88 is the substantial equivalent of a ball bearing action and is characterized by minimal wear and minimal friction. The manner in which the drive cam surfaces engage the spherically generated surfaces of the pumping members is a most important feature of my in;  \\n vention because of the highly desirable results achieved by its utilization. Furthermore, the fact that the driving member 85 is surrounded and partially supported by the pumping members results in substantially dynamic stability and prevents the imposition of unbalanced radial loads on the shaft and the rotor and thus avoids the frictional losses and the wear otherwise attendant thereupon.  \\n  Each of the pumping members 88 is provided at its opposite ends with opposed pistons 102 and 104, the opposed pistons 102 and 104 being reciprocable and rotatable, respectively, in the opposed cylinders 72 and 78. Therefore, in addition to providing their ordinary functions of permitting the pumping of inlet fluid from the cylinders 72 and 78, the pistons 1-02 and 104 serve as bearing spindles which permit the rotation of the pumping members 88 by the rotatable cam 86. It can readily be perceived that, when the rotation of the cam 86 causes the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88, the pistons 102 and 104 are simultaneously rotated and reciprocated in the opposed cylinders 72 and 7 8 of the first and second banks of cylinders, the exhaust stroke of one piston being accompanied by a concomitant intake stroke of its opposed piston.  \\n  The construction of the first and second valve means 62 and 6 5 will now be considered in greater detail, it being understood that since the valve means 62 and 64 are substantially identical in configuration but oppositely oriented with respect to one another, the first valve means 62 only will be described in detail, identical reference numerals being utilized to indicate identical portions of the second valve means 64. As best shown in Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5, the first valve means 62 is of substantially cylindrical configuration and is provided at one end with an annular exhaust channel 106 which communicates continuously with the first outlet passage 66 and is interposed between said outlet passage 66 and a pair of horizontal exhaust bays 108 and 109 which are disposed on opposite sides of the valve 62. The bays 108 and 109 of the valves 62 and 64 are adapted to communicate, as best shown in Figs. 1, 4, and 5 of the drawings, with the passages 75 and 81 to the cylinder chambers 74 and 80, respectively, thus exhausting pressure fluid from the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 upon the pressure strokes of the pistons 102 and 104, respectively, associated therewith.  \\n  Also provided in the first valve means 62 is a transverse inlet passage 111 which, as best shown in Figs. 2 and 4 of the drawings, is bisected by the inlet channel 52 between the rotor 30 and the drive shaft 25 and has its ends communicating with inlet bays 112 and 113 on opposite sides of the valve 62 to permit inlet fluid to flow from the inlet channel, through the inlet bays 112 and 113 and into the passages 75 and 81 associated, respectively, with the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 to permit the ingress of fluid to the cylinders 72 and 78. It should be noted here that the second valve means 64, while identical in configuration with the first valve means 62, is not only oppositely oriented with respect to the first valve means 62 so that the inlet passages 111 of the two valves face each other, but is also rotated 90 about the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 so that, as best viewed in Fig. 1 of the drawings, those cylinders which are directly opposed to each other, as in the case of the cylinders 72 and 78 of Fig. 1, will be opened, respectively, to communication with the inlet channel 52 and the exhaust bay 108 in&#39;order that fluid may be drawn into the cylinder chamber 74 by the intake stroke of the piston 102 and expelled from the cylinder chamber 80 by the pressure stroke of the piston 104.  \\n  Therefore, as the rotatable drive cam 86 is rotated by the rotation of the drive shaft 25, the first and second valves 62 and 64 are simultaneously rotated, the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 and the valves 62 and 64 being so coordinated that, when the pumping members 88 are shifted to the right, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the draw-T ings, the inlet passage 111 in the valve 62 registers &#34;with the cylinders 72 and the cylinder chambers 74 of said cylinders in which the pistons 102 are initiating or pass-j ing through their intake strokes while, on the other hand, the exhaust bays 108 and 109 of the valves 62 an&#39;d 64 are registered with those cylinders in which the pistons are completing their pressure strokes so that fluid under pressure may be fed by means of the exhaust bays and the annular exhaust channel 106 into the outlet channel 67.  \\n &#39; The manner in which the valve 62 controls the flow of inlet fluid and pressure fluid into and from the various cylinders is graphically illustrated in Fig. 2 of the drawings, those arrows which point toward the cylinders.- 72 and away from the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 indicating the flow of inlet fluid from the inlet channel 52 to the inlet passage 111 in the valve 62 and into&#34; the cylinders 72 in which the pistons 102 are at varying positions in their intake strokes. It will be noted that the arrows which are directed away from the cylinders 72 and toward the center of, the drive shaft 25 indicate the flow of fluid under pressure from the cylinders 72 and into the oppositely disposed exhaust bays 108 and 109 whence the pressure fluid flows into the annular exhaust channel 106 of the valve 62 and thence through the first outlet passage 66 and the outlet channel 67 into the outlet port 68. It is thus apparent that, by the pro-&#39; vision of a valve of the configuration disclosed herein, and by the integration of the action of the valve 62 with the valve 64 and the provision of double acting pumping members 88, it is possible to provide a pump characterized by the maintenance of a continuous and uniform high pressure head in which discharge surge is practically eliminated.  \\n  A by-pass chamber 115 is constituted by a space between the&#39; right-end of the second stator plate 22 and the end plate 23, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings. The by-pass chamber 115 is maintained in communication with the cam and temperatureand pressure equalizing chamber 73 by means of a by-pass passage 117 so that pressure fluid leaking past the second valve 64 and the drive shaft 25 may be returned to the chamber 73. The chamber 73 is connected by means of a drain pas: sage 119 to a drain port 121 in the end plate 14, said drain port being, in turn, connected to a reservoir of the fluid being pumped. Since it is intended that the pump 10 will generally be utilized in a closed system, the cam chamber 73 is continually maintained full of fluid at low pressure because of the by-passing of fluid thereinto from the by-pass chamber 115 through the by-pass passage 117 and also because of the leakage past the pistons from the cylinders of the pump. The pressure fluid in the cam chamber 73 serves the valuable function of equalizing the temperature between the various operating components of the pump and also serves as a lubricant and hydraulic cushion for the various operating components of the pump. The end plate 14 contains both the inlet and outlet ports 35 and 68, respectively, permitting the incorporation of the pump 10 in pump and motor combinations in a manner which will be described in greater detail below.  \\n  Although, in describing the invention as a pump, stress has been laid upon the pumping function thereof, it is obvious that the principles of my invention could be utilized in a motor of somewhat similar structure.  \\n  Another embodiment of my invention, as shown in Figs. 6-9 of the drawings, is a pump 125 including a housing 126. In describing the pump 125, those portions of the pump 125 which are identical with portions of the previously discussed embodiment will be designated by identical reference numerals for convenience in description and to prevent duplication. The housing 126 is substantially cylindrical in configuration and is constituted by afirst end fitting 128, a first stator plate 130,  \\n  g aeam chmaber plate 131, a second stator plate 132 and a second end fitting 134. The various components of. the housing are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of bolts 135 extending therethrough.  \\n  Mounted in the housing 126 and having its longitudinal axis disposed substantially centrally thereof is a drive shaft 25 which is provided with a splined outer end 26 adapted to establish a driving connection with a source of power to cause the operation and rotation of the drive shaft 25. Mounted on the drive shaft 25 and secured thereto by means of a shear pin 28 is a rotor 137, said rotor being rotatable by and concomitantly with the drive shaft 25. Disposed in the second end fitting 134 and encompassing the periphery of the drive shaft 25 is an oil seal combination 32 adapted to prevent the leakage of fluid from the pump around the periphery of the drive shaft 25.  \\n  The first end fitting 128 provides an inlet port 139 .which communicates with a booster chamber 140, it being understood that the inlet and booster chambers 139 and 140, respectively, constitute portions of a fluid inlet passage 141, the other components of which will be described subsequently. Disposed in the booster chamber 140 is a booster impeller 142 which is secured to the left-hand end of the drive shaft 25, as shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings, and which is adapted to boost the pressure of the inlet fluid as it passes through the booster chamber 140. Disposed in the first end fitting 128 and supported thereby against the left-hand face of the first stator plate 130 is a booster plate 143 which defines one wall of the booster chamber 140 and is provided with a plurality of vertical inlet openings 144. The booster plate 143 has a centrally located opening 146 provided therein in which is mounted a bushing 147 for supporting the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 142.  \\n  The rotor 137 is hollow for the major portion of its length and has its interior wall spaced from the periphery of the drive shaft 25 to define an elongated inlet channel 149 which constitutes a portion of the fluid inlet passage 141 and communicates at its left-hand end, as best shown inFig. 6 of the drawings, with the inlet openings 144 in the booster plate 143. A first inlet chamber 152 is provided in the first stator plate 130 and is lined with a sleeve or bushing 153 which encompasses a first valve means 154 formed integrally with the left-hand end of the rotor 137. A second inlet chamber &#39;156 is provided in the second stator plate 132, said second inlet chamber being lined by a sleeve or bushing 157 which receives a second valve means 158 formed integrally with the righthand end of the rotor 137, as best shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings.  \\n Since the first and second valve means 154 and 158 are of identical construction with the exception that their positions at the opposite ends of the rotor 137 are reversed and the second valve means 158 is rotated 90 about the axis of the drive shaft 25, the description of the first valve means 154 will apply with equal cogency to the description of the second valve means 158, like portions of the second valve means 158 being designated by identical reference numerals utilized in designated like portions of the first valve means 154. The first valve means 154 is provided with a transverse inlet port 160 which communicates with the elongated inlet channel149 in the rotor 137 and is adapted to transfer inlet fluid from said channel through inlet orifices 162 in the sleeve &#39;153 which cormnunicate with the passages 75 between the first inlet chamber 152 and the cylinder chambers 74 of the cylinders 72, thus permitting inletvfluid to flow into the cylinder chambers 74 and to be acted upon by the pistons 102 therein. Similarly, fluid flows through the transverse inlet port 160 in the second valve means 158 through the passages 81 communicating with the cylinder chambers 80.  \\n Since the constructions of the rotatable drive cam 86 and the pumping members 88 are identical with the son structions of these components in the previously discussed embodiment of my invention, they will not be referred to in detail herein, it being understood that the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 and the first and second valve means 154 and 158, respectively, is synchronized with the reciprocation of the pumping members 88 and the pistons 102 and 104 associated therewith so that the first and second valve means 154 and 158 are appropriately disposed when the pistons 102 and 104 are reciprocated by the action of the rotatable cam 86, so that inlet fluid may be fed into the cylinder chambers associated therewith at the appropriate moment.  \\n  One of the major distinctions between the pump of my invention and the previously discussed pump 10 of my invention is the manner in which pressure fluid is fed from the cylinder chambers 74 and 810, respectively, by the action of the pistons 102 and 104, respectively. Each of the cylinder chambers 74 and 80* communicates with a check valve 164, at best shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 9 of the drawings, which permits pressure fluid to be fed into a substantially circumferential outlet passage 166 when the pressure of the fluid reaches a predetermined value.  \\n  Each of the check valves 164, as best shown in Fig. 9 of the drawings, includes a plug 168 which is threadedly engaged in a bore 169 formed in the periphery of the first stator plate 130. The plug 168 provides a valve guide 169 in which is disposed the stem 170 of a poppet type valve 171 which seats on a seat 172 toprevent the flow of pressure fluid from an associated cylinder chamber 74 until the pressure of the fluid reaches a value sufficient to overcome the compression of a spring 175 encompassing the valve guide 169&#39; and biasing the valve 171 on the seat 172. The plug 168 is provided with a plurality of drainage ports 176 adjacent the base of the valve guide 169 to permit pressure fluid seeping between the periphery of the valve stem 170 and the interior of the valve guide 169&#39; to be drained off and prevent it from locking the stem 170 and thus preventing the movement of the poppet valve 171. The plug 168 is also provided with a transverse port 177 registering with the bore of the outlet passage 166 to permit free flow of outlet fluid therepast.  \\n  Therefore, when, as best shown in Fig. 7 of the drawings, the body of the first valve means 154 blocks the inlet passages 75 to the cylinder chambers 74 and the pistons 102 arebeing driven into the cylinders 72, the pressure of the fluid is elevated to a point where the poppet valves 171 are driven off their seats 172 to permit the egress of pressure fluid into the circumferential outlet passage 166. The circumferential outlet passage 166 communicates with a main outlet passage 178 which, in turn, feeds the pressure fluid into an outlet port 179 on the cam plate 131. It should be noted here that the second stator plate 132 is provided with an identical circumferential outlet passage 166 which also communicates with the main outlet passage 178. It is, therefore, apparent that the pressure fluid is fed from the various cylinder chambers of the pump 125 as the rotation of the first and second valve means 154 and 158 causes the various cylinder chambers to be sealed and permits the pressure in the cylinder chambers to rise to a value which will overcome the check valves 164. Since the discharge of pressure fluid from the cylinder chambers is controlled by check valves, minimum inlet restriction is encountered and minimum leakage about the perimeter of the first and second valve means 154 and 158 occurs.  \\n  It may be noted here that the rotary cam 86 and the pumping members 88 are disposed in a cam and pressure chamber 180 which is adapted to receive inlet fluid through a passage 182 which communicates at one end, as best shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings, with one of the openings 144 in the booster plate 143 and is thus adapted to transmit boosted inlet fluid directly to the interior of the cam and pressure.chamber.180. The flow of. islet 11 fluid through the passage 182 is controlled by a ball check 183 which seats on a seat 184 by means of a compression spring 185. When the pressure of the fluid in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 130 is less than the pressure of the boosted inlet fluid passing through the opening 144 in the booster plate 143, the pressure differential between the chamber 180 and the opening 144 permits the ball check 183 to be driven off 1ts seat 184 and the passage of boosted inlet fluid into the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamher 180 is thus permitted. However, when the pressure of the fluid in the chamber 180 rises above the pressure of the boosted inlet fluid, the pressure differential between the fluid in the chamber 130 and the boosted inlet fluid 1n the opening 144 in the booster plate 143 causes the ball check 183 to be seated on the seat 184. Of course, the compression spring 135 can be so calculated that a pressure differential of a desired maximum value must be achieved between the chamber 180 and the opening 144 in the booster plate 143 before the ball check 183 can be driven off its seat 184 or, conversely, can be so calculated that a minimum pressure differential is necessary to cause the ball check to be driven off its seat.  \\n  Another source of pressure fluid for the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 180 is provided by a by-pass chamber 186 in the second end fitting 134, said by-pass chamber being connected to and maintained in communication with the chamber 180 by a by-pass passage 187. When the pressure fluid in the chamber 18!) increases beyond the capacity of the chamber 180, it is drained off through a drain port 189 on the unders de of the cam and fluid pressure plate 131 and contrnuous circulation of the fluid through the chamber is thus accomplished.  \\n  As previously indicated in the discussion of the pump 10, the presence of pressure fluid in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 180 equalizes the temperature between the various operating components located in the chamber, acts as a hydraulic cushion for the componentoperating parts and also serves to drain fluid by-passed about the various operating parts to prevent leakage at theexterior of the pump 125.  \\n  Since there is a possibility that particles of metal from poorly filtered fluid may enter the chamber 180, there is provided in the second stator plate 132, as best shown in Figs. 7 and 10 of the drawings, an opening 191 which provides a mounting for a sleeve 192 in which is located a cylindrical, magnetic element 123, the forward end of which projects into the chamber 181) and is adapted to gather upon its surface particles of iron and steel which are present in the pressure fluid in the chamber 180 so that the particles wili not remain in circulation in the chamber with possible damage to the mechanism.  \\n  Another embodiment of my invention, as shown in Figs, 11-21 of the drawings, is constituted by a pump 2% which includes a housing 201. In describing. the pump 2%, those portions thereof which are identical with portions of the previously discussed embodiments of the invention will be designated by identicalreference numerals for convenience in description and to avoid duplication. It should be noted that the pump 200 is, in many details of construction, quite similar to the pump 125 shown in Figs. 6-9 of the drawings and described in detail hereinbefore.  \\n  The housing 201is substantially cylindrical in configuration and is constituted by a first end fitting 202, a first stator plate 204, a cam chamber plate 206, a second stator plate 208, and a second end fitting 210. The various components of the housing are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of bolts 211 extending therethrough.  \\n  Mounted in the housing 201 and having its longitudinal axis disposed substantially centrally thereof, is a drive shaft 25 which is provided with a splined outer end 26 adapted to establish a driving connection with a source 12 of power to cause the operation and rotation of the drive shaft 25. Mounted on the drive shaft 25 and secured thereto by means of a shear pin &#39;28 is a rotor&#39;214, said rotor being rotatable by and concomitantly with thedr&#39;ive shaft 2 5. Disposed in the second endfitting 208 and encompassing the periphery of the drive shaft 25 is-an oil seal combination 32 for preventing major-leakage of fluid from the pump around the periphery of the drive shaft 25. However, the oil seal combination 32 which has been schematically shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings is adapted to by-pass pressure fiuid when the pressures encountered in the pump housing 201 reach extremely high levels, as will be described in detail hereinafter.  \\n  The first end fitting 202 provides an inlet port 139 which communicates with a booster chamber 140, it being understood that the inlet 139 and the booster chamber 140 constitute portions of a fluid inlet passage 141, the other components of which will be described below. Disposed in the booster chamber 140 is a booster impeller 216 which is secured to the left-hand end of the drive shaft 25, as shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, and which is adapted to boost the pressure of the inlet fluid as it passes through the booster chamber 140. Disposed in the first end fitting 202, and supported therein in spaced relationship with the left-hand wall of the first stator plate 204 by means of dowels 217 which are secured in a mounting plate 218 juxtaposed to the stator plate 204, is a booster plate 220 which acts as a stator with respect to the booster impeller 216 associated therewith. The space between the booster plate 220 and the mounting plate 218 therefor constitutes a first, vertical inlet chamber 222. The booster plate 220 has a centrally located opening 223 provided therein in which is mounted a bushing 224 for supporting the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 216. v  \\n  The rotor 214 is hollow for the major portion of its length and has its interior wall spaced from the periphery of the drive shaft 25 to define an elongated inlet channel 149 which constitutes a portion of the fluid inlet passage 141 and communicates, at its left-hand end, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, with the vertical inlet chamber 222 between the mounting plate 218 and the booster plate 220.  \\n  Communicating with the first inlet chamber 222 is first inlet valve means 226, said first inlet valve means being exposed to the full flow of fluid from the booster impeller 216 prior to the entry thereof into the elongated inlet channel 149 in the rotor 214. A plurality of outlet ports 228 are provided in the right-hand end of the rotor 214, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, which communicate continuously with channels 229 formed in the Second stator plate 208 which, in turn, are maintained in continuous communication with a second inlet chamber 230 provided in the second end fitting 210. Therefore, the inlet fluid pressurized by passage through the booster impeller 216 flows through the first inlet chamber 222 into the elongated inlet channel 149 defined by the interior of the rotor 214 and the periphery of the drive shaft 25. From the elongated inlet channel 149 the fluid flows through the radially oriented ports 228 in the right-hand end of the rotor 214 and into the second inlet chamber 230. Disposed in fluid communication with the second inlet chamber 230&#39; are second inlet valve means 232, said second inlet valve means 232 being constantly subjected to fluid pressure in the second inlet chamber 239 because of the constant communication of the second inlet chamber 230 with the first inlet chamber 222.  \\n  A plurality of cylinders 72, as best shown in Figs. 11 and 12 of the drawings, is provided in the first stator plate 204, said cylinders being arranged about the perimeter of a circle concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and having their right-hand ends, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, communicating 13 with a cam and pressure-equalizing chamber 73 provided in the interior of the cam chamber plate 206. Each of the. cylinders 72 is disposable in fluid communication with the first inlet chamber 222 by means of the first inlet valve means 226, the first inlet valve means 226 controlling the flow of inlet fluid into the cylinder chambers 74. of the cylinders 72 in a manner which will be described in greater detail below.  \\n  The cylinders 72 constitute a first bank of cylinders into which inlet fluid is fed and from which pressure fiuid is discharged, each of the cylinders 72 being lined with a bronze or brass bushing 234 to provide a bearing surface in the interior of each of the cylinders 72 for a purpose&#39;which will be described in greater detail below.  \\n  The second stator plate 208 is provided with a plurality of cylinders 78 which are also arranged about the perimeter of a circle whose center is concentric with the lon gitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25, each of the cylinders 78 communicating at its left-hand end with the cam chamber 73 and at its right-hand end being disposed in fluid communication with the second inlet chamber 230 through the second inlet valve means 232. Each of the cylinders 78 incorporates a cylinder chamber 80 and is provided with a brass or bronze bearing bushing 234. The cylinders 78 constitute a second bank of cylinders,  \\n said second bank of cylinders being disposed on the opposite side of the chamber 73 from the first bank of cylinders previously described.  \\n  Formed integrally with the rotor 214 and disposed in the cam, temperature, and pressure-equalizing chamber 73 is a rotatable driving member 236 having a spherically generated cam surface 238, said cam surface 238 being &#39;operatively engaged with a plurality of pumping members, indicated generally at 240, which are also disposed in the chamber 73.  \\n  The rotatable cam surface 238, as best shown in Figs. 11 and l8-2l of the drawings, includes first and second cam portions 242 and 243, each of which is provided with at least two rises 245 and two falls 246, the undulated rises 245 on the second cam portion 243 being disposed opposite the undulated falls 246 on the first cam portion 242. It should be noted that the first and second cam portions 242 and 243 are spherically generated in the same manner as the cam portions on the drive members of the previously discussed embodiments of the invention to accomplish the same desirable purposes pre- &#39;viously adverted to in the description of the drive memtionships with respect to the spherically generated cam surface 238 of the driving member 236 and are also, as  \\n will be described in greater detail below, individually generated on spheres of different diameters to accomplish certain desirable results which will be indicated hereinbelow.  \\n  As best shown in Figs. 18-20 of the drawings, a first pumping member 249 is provided with relatively closely spaced cam follower lobes 250, a second pumping member 251 is provided with cam follower lobes 252 which i are more widely spaced than the cam follower lobes 250 of the pumping member 249, while a third pumping member 253 is provided with the most widely spaced cam gfollower lobes 254, it being noted that the spacing of the lobes on the various pumping members is accomplished Ebythe variation in the length of the intermediate cylinfc drical section 256 of each of the pumping members.  \\n  14 Due to the different spacings of the cam follower lobes 250, 252, and 254, respectively, the surface of the drive cam 238 is contacted in three major zones; an inner zone 258, an intermediate zone 260, and an outer zone 262.  \\n Therefore, the most closely spaced cam follower lobes 250 will have their surfaces engage the spherically generated drive cam surface 238 of the rotatable driving member 236 on the inner zone 258, the cam lobes 252 and 254 of the pumping members 251 and 253, respectively, being disposed, respectively, in engagement with the intermediate and outer contact zones 260 and 262,  \\n  Of course, due to the limited transverse area of the drive cam surface 238, the zones of contact of the various cam follower lobes overlap, to a certain extent, but the major areas of contact are distinguishable, one from the other.  \\n  By providing pumping members having cam follower lobes which engage the drive cams on the rotatable drive member 236 in different contact zones, it is possible to materially reduce the wear on the drive cam surface 238 in addition to materially equalizing any wear that may occur because all of the load on the drive cam surface 238 is not concentrated in a single zone but is equally distributed across the entire surface of the drive cam.  \\n  Furthermore, in addition to providing cam lobes which are spaced at different distances with respect to each other, I provide cam follower lobes whose spherical configuration is slightly different from the spherical configuration of the drive cam so that substantially linear contact between the cam follower lobe surfaces and the drive cam surface is achieved. This is illustrated in Figs. l8-20 by the lines 264, 265, and 266, respectively, to indicate that contact is being made between the respective cam follower lobes 250, 252, and 254 in line contact. It should be noted that the spherical deviation of the respective cam follower lobes from the spherical configuration of the drive cam surface 238 is relatively minute so that, while the major portion of the contact load is transmitted to the cam followers through a line contact, the remainder of the surfaces of the cam followers are in substantial contact with the drive cam surface 238. As  \\n previously indicated in discussing the different spacing of the cam follower lobes, the provision of cam follower lobes whose sphericity is slightly different from the sphericity of the drive cam prevents significant overlapping of the contact zones of the respective cam follower lobes and results in equalization and material reduction of wear on both the cam follower lobes and the drive cam itself.  \\n  In order to accomplish the most effective distribution of wear on the drive cam surface 238, the various pumping members are so arranged in relation to one another that, as best shown in Fig. 12 of the drawings, adjacent pumping members all have different contact zones on the drive cam surface 238. For instance, the pumping member 249 is juxtaposed to the pumping member 251 which is, in turn, juxtaposed to the pumping member 253 which is, in turn, juxtaposed to a pumping member 251. The different spacings of the cam follower lobes, the generation of slightly different sphericities on the cam follower lobes from the sphericity of the drive cam surface and the interspersing of pumping members whose lobes are differently spaced and/or generated on spheres of different diameters are most important features of my invention because they materially reduce the wear which one would expect to encounter at the tremendously high speeds of operation of the pump 200 and, also, serve to reduce the frictional heat which one would expect to encounter at such high speeds, materially enhancing and prolonging the life of the pump and improving the operational characteristics thereof.  \\n  When the-drive shaft 25 is rotated to cause the concomitant rotation of the rotor 214, the driving member 236 is simultaneously rotated and the cam surface 238 thereof moves against the cam follower portions of the configuration.  \\n &#39;15 and 16 of the drawings.  \\n pumping members 249, 251 and 253, respectively, thus imparting thereto both rotary and longitudinal movement for a purpose which will be described in greater detail below. As indicated in the consideration of the previously discussed embodiment of my invention, the spherical generation of both the drive cam surface 238 and the spherical generation of the cam follower lobes which are disposed in driven relationship therewith, provide substantially ball bearing characteristics materially reducing the frictional wear encountered and frictional heat which might normally be expected in constructions of the character under consideration.  \\n  Each of the pumping members 240 is provided at its opposite end with opposed pistons 102 and 104, said pistons being reciprocable and rotatable, respectively, in the opposed cylinders 72 and 78 and, more particularly, in the bushings 234 disposed in and lining the walls of said cylinders. Therefore, in addition to their ordinary function of pumping inlet fluid from the cylinders 72 and 78, the pistons 102 and 104 serve as bearing spindles which permit the rotation of the pumping members 240 by the rotatable drive member 236. It can readily be perceived that, when the rotation of the drive member 236 causes the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 240, the pistons 102 and 104 are simultaneously rotated and reciprocated in the bushings 234 lining the opposed cylinders 72 and 78 of the first and second banks of cylinders, the exhaust stroke of one piston being accompanied by a concomitant intake stroke of its opposed piston. The simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the pistons 102 and 104 in the cylinders 72 and 78, respectively, prevent the formation of hot bands on the pistons since the rotation thereof dissipatcs heat generated by the movement of said pistons throughout the entire wall of each cylinder and obviates,  \\n the possibility that localized over-heated areas may occur.  \\n  The construction of the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 will now be considered in greater detail, it being understood that since the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 are substantially identical in configuration, but oppositely oriented with respect to one another, the first inlet valve means 226 only will be described in detail, identical reference numerals being applied to indicate identical portions of the second inlet valve means 232. As best shown in Figs. 14 and 15 of the drawings, the first inlet valve means 226 is of the poppet valve type and includes a poppet valve 270 which is mounted and reciprocable in a combination guide and seat member 272 which is of substantially cylindrical The combination seat and guide member 272 is disposed in the left-hand end of the cylinder 72 internally of the bushing 234, as best shown in Figs. 14 and 15 of the drawings, and includes, at its extreme lefthand end, a centrally located valve guide 274 which encompasses the stem 275 of the poppet valve 270 and prevents lateral deflection of said stem within the member 272. Provided on the extreme right-hand end of the member 272 is a valve seat 276, said seat being engageable by the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 to prevent inlet of fluid into the valve chamber 74 and outlet of fluid from said valve chamber. I  \\n  It will be noted that, as best shown in Fig. 15 of the drawings, an overlapping portion 279 of the mounting plate 218 engages the combined guide and seat member, 272 to prevent its dislocation from the end of the bushing 23 It should also be noted that the member 272 is provided with an elongated inlet channel 281 which is maintained in constant communication with the first inlet chamber 222.  \\n  Provided adjacent the end of the stern 275 is a pair of oppositely disposed notches 283, best shown in Figs. A spring seat member or retainer 284 is mounted on the end of the stem 275, said member including&#39;an arcuate top portion 285 which has forr&#39;ned integrally therewith depending arcuate side por- 1&#39;6 tions 287, the lowermost ends of which constitute retaining fingers 289 receivable in the oppositely disposed notches 283 on the stem 275. I  \\n  The top portion 285 and the depending side portions 287 of the spring seat member 284 define an elongated cavity 291 and the top portion 285 is provided with overhanging ends 293 which serve as spring seats 295. A substantially cylindrical keeper or retainer 296 is dise posed in the elongated cavity 291 and is provided with a centrally located recess 297 which receives the outermost end of the valve stem 275 of the poppet valve 270. A fluid by-pass port 299 is provided in the top portion 285 of the spring seat member 284 to permit by-passing of pressure fluid entrapped in the elongated cavity 291.  \\n  Encompassing the valve stem 275 and having its outermost or left-hand end, as best shown in Fig. 15 of the drawings, seated on the spring seat 295 provided by the spring seat member 284 is a compression spring 302, the opposite or right-hand end of the spring 302 being seated on a spring seat 303 provided on the combined guide and seat member 272, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings. By the provision of the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 in the form of poppet valves, frictional wear and possible seizure which may be encountered with rotary valves of the character incorporated in the previously discussed embodiments of my invention are eliminated. Furthermore, the unswept volume of the cylinder chambers 74 and is reduced to a minimum.  \\n  The compression spring 302 normally biases the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 on the seat 276 provided on the combined guide and seat member 272, thereby preventing the ingress or egress of fluid from the cylinder chamber 74 through the inlet passage 281 in the member 272. However, when the piston 102 is moved by the pumping member 240 with which it is integrally formed through its exhaust stroke into the position shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, a negative pressure area is created in the cylinder chamber 74 across the head 277 of the poppet valve 270. This negative pressure, coupled with the positive pressure imposed upon the other side of the valve by the boosted pressure fluid in the first inlet chamber 222, overcomes the bias of the compression spring 302 permitting the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 to move out of engagement with the seat 276 and permitting the inflow of fluid into the cylinder chamber 74. When the piston 102 starts its return or pumping stroke in which it moves toward the lefthand end of the cylinder, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, the poppet valve 270 is seated on the seat 276 to prevent the egress of pressure fluid therepast into the inlet channel 281. It is readily apparent, therefore, that the operation of the first inlet valve means and, more particularly, the poppet valve 270 constituting an essential portion thereof, is directly responsive to the energization of the piston with which it is associated and is attributable both to the action of the piston and to the positive pressure exerted thereupon by the inlet fluid passing into the first inlet chamber 222 from the booster impeller 216. The provision of poppet-type valve means for the first and second inlet valve means eliminates the disadvantages of rotary-type valve means such as binding and high frictional losses and, furthermore, reduces the unswept volume of the cylinder chambers to a minimum, the unswept volume being defined as that volume of &#39;the cylinder chamber which is not traversed by the reciprocation of the piston. The unswept volume of the cylinder chambers can be materially reduced since there is no necessity for providing the elongated entry and exit ports which must necessarily be provided with rotary-type valve means as is clear from the previously discussed embodiment of the invention. Therefore, since the relatively large volume of inlet and outlet channels to and from the cylinder chamber which is found when rotary valves are. utilized is eliminated by the use of direct valving means such as the poppet valve means described above, more effective pumping action may be achieved and operation of the pump with lower leakage losses, due to positive inlet and outlet valving, may be obtained.  \\n  It should also be noted that the construction of the first and second inlet valve means by my invention is characterized by ease of assembly, minimum number of parts, and relatively long life. In the first place, the assembly of the valve structure is accomplished by the insertion of the poppet valve 270 in the member 272, the compression spring 302 then being placed on the seat 303 on the member 272. The keeper 296 is then placed over the outer end of the stem 275 of the valve 270, the end of the stem being received in the centrally located recess in said keeper, and the spring seat member 284 is then secured to the end of the stern 275 by slidable engagement of the retaining fingers 289 with the oppositely disposed notches 283 on the opposite sides of the stem 275. By means of this relatively simple and compact assembly, the spring seat member 284 is secured against inadvertent displacement from the end of the stem 275 but, neverthe less, can be easily installed or voluntarily removed when necessary.  \\n  Thus, as the driving member 236 is rotated in the cam chamber 73, the simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the associated pumping members 240 is accomplished thereby, causing the concomitant reciprocation and rotation of the oppositely disposed pistons 102 and 104 formed integrally therewith. As indicated previously, the configuration of thedrive cam surface 238 on the rotary driving member 236 causes the pumping members 240 to be reciprocated four times during each rotation of the driving member, resulting in four strokes per member or twenty-eight strokes for each revolution of the driving member 236 in a pump suchas the pump 200 which is provided with seven pumping members.  \\n  It should be noted that the pump 200 is provided with outlet check valve means 164 installed in each of the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 which check valve means are substantially identical with the check valve means previously shown and discussed in the disclosure of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 9 of the drawings. The check valve means 164 permits pressure fluid to be fed from the individual cylinder chambers under the action of the associated pistons into substantially circumferential outlet passages 166 when the pressure of the fluid in the individual cylinder chambers reaches a predetermined value.  \\n  Of course, circumferential outlet passages 166 are located in both the first stator plate 204 and the second stator plate 208, the first outletpassage 166 in the first stator plate collecting the outlet fluid from the first bank of cylinders and the second outlet passage 166 in the second stator plate 208 collecting the outlet fluid from the second bank of cylinders.  \\n  Since the construction of each of the outlet check valves is identical, only one of the outlet check valves 164 in the first stator plate 204, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, will be described. Each of the check valves&#39;164 includes a plug 168 which is threadedly engaged in a bore 169 formed in the first stator plate 204, the bore 169 continuing inwardly to traverse the fluid outlet passage 166 and terminate in communication with a cylinder chamber 74. The plug &#39;168 provides a valve guide 169&#39; in which is disposed the stem 170 of a poppet-type valve 171which seats on a seat 172 to prevent flow of pressure fluid from .itsassociated cylinder chamber 74 until the pressure of the fluid, under the action of the piston 102, reaches a value suflicient to overcome. the compression of a spring 175 encompassing the valve guide 169&#39; and biasing the valve 171 on the seat 172. The plug 168is provided with a plurality of drainage ports 176 adjacent the base of the valve guide 169&#39; to permit pressure fluid seeping between the periphery of the valve stem 170 and theinterior of the valve guide 169&#39; to be drained otr 18- and prevented from looking the valve stem and thus preventing the movement of the poppet valve 171.  \\n  The plug 168 is also provided with a transverse port 177 registering with the bore of the outlet passage 166 to permit free flow of outlet fluid therepast. Therefore, when the piston 102 initiates its pumping stroke and thus seats the inlet poppet valve 270 to prevent the egress of fluid from the cylinder chamber &#39;74 past the poppet valve 270, the pressure of the fluid in the cylinder chamber 74 is elevated to a point where the poppet valve 171 is driven off its seat 172 to permit the egress of pressure fluid into the circumferential outlet passage 166.  \\n  The circumferential outlet passage 166 communicates with a main outlet passage 178 which, in turn, feeds the pressure fluid into an outlet port 179 in the cam plate 206. In this manner, pressure fluid is fed from both outlet passages 166 in the stator plates 204 and 208, respectively, into the opposite ends of the main outlet passage 178. Pressure fluid is thus fed from the various cylinder chambers of the pump 200 and the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 are closed and the outlet check valve means 164 are opened by the increase in pressure of the fluid&#39;in the various cylinder chambers. Since the inlet and discharge of fluid into and from the cylinder chambers are controlled by poppet-type valves, minimum inlet and outlet restriction is encountered and minimum leakage loss due to inadequate valving occurs.  \\n  Inorder that the cam chamber 73 may be continuously subjected to a constant flow of pressure fluid to accomplish both heat transfer from the rotatable drivingmember 236 audits associated pumping members 240, and alsov to lubricate the same, a pressure inlet passage 306 is provided in the first stator plate 204, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, one end of said pressure passage being maintained in communication with the pressure inlet chamber 222, while the other end thereof communicates with the cam chamber 73.  \\n  In the previously discussed embodiments of my invention, the return fluid from the cam chamber 73 has been returned-to the reservoir, butin the presently discussed embodiment of my invention, as best shown in Fig. 13 of the drawings, I have provided a fluid return passage 308 which communicates directly with the fluid inlet port .139. and thus returns fluid from the chamber 73 directlyto the inlet port 139. By the above described construction, continuous circulation of lubricating and cooling fluid through the cam chamber 73 is accomplished and the additional port provided in the housings of the previously discussed embodiments of my invention for the return of the fluid. from the cam chamber 73 has been eliminated, thus providing an external housing with only the major inlet and outlet ports 139 and 179 and also accomplishing the: elimination of a return line to the reservoir.  \\n  The aforementioned seal 32 at the right-hand of the drive shaft 25 includes a rotatable sealing member 311 which directly engages the end of the rotor 214 on the shaft 25 and which is biased into operative relationship therewith by means of a compression spring 313. The rotatablesealing member 311 is engaged by a sealing ring 315&#39;which is backed up by a collar 317 which is, in turn, biased into engagement with the ring 315 by means of a spring washer 319. This resilient sealing construction embodied in the seal 32 is interposed between the second inlet fluid chamber 230 and a drain chamber 320 so that any fluid by-passing the seal 32may be received in. the drain chamber 320 and conducted therefrom through a drain passage 321 to a drain port 322 whence the fluid may be discharged to atmosphere or to a drain tank or, if desired, returned to the reservoir.  \\n  An alternative embodiment of my invention is shown in Fig. 22 of the drawings and is exemplified in a pump 330, the housing structure of which is somewhat similar in characterto that of the pump shown in Figs.  \\n  19 1-4 of the drawings, but the valving structure of&#39;which is substantially identical with that of the pump 200 discussed irnm&#39;ediately &#39;hereinabove; &#39;Therefore, in describing the construction of the pump 330, identical reference numerals will be applied to those portions of the structure which are identical with portions of the premeans of bolts 13. Among the sections constituting the housing 332 are a first combined mounting and end plate 334, a first stator plate 336, an intermediate cam chamber housing plate 338, a second &#39;stator plate 340, and second end plate 342. Mounted centrally of&#39;the housing 332 and having its longitudinal axis&#39;substantially coincident with the longitudinal aXis of said housing is&#39;a drive shaft 25, said sh&#39;afthaving a splined end 26 engageable by a driving member, in&#39;a manner which willbe described in greater detail below.  \\n  A retort 214 identical-with the previously discussed rotor of the pump 200 is mounted on the&#39;shaft&#39;25 for rotation therewith. An oil seal 32 is provided at the right-hand end of the housing, as best shown in Fig. 22 of the drawings, to preventleakage of oil from the interior of the pump 330.  \\n  1 An inlet port35 communicates witha&#39;booster chamber 36, both the inlet port and booster chamber being provided in the first end plate&#39;334. Disposed in the booster chamber 36 is &#39;aL-centrifugal-type booster impeller 38*which is keyed to&#39;the left-handjend of the drive shaft 25 for rotation thereby. A booster plate 37 cooperates with the booster impeller 38 and permits boosted inlet fluid to be-fed into a first inlet fluid chamber 222 whence it is permitted to flow into an elongated inlet channel 149-p r ovi ded between the interior of the rotor 214 andthe periphery of the drive shaft 25.  \\n  The inlet fluid flows from the channel 149 through ports 229 at&#39; the end of the rotor 214 into a second nlet chamber 230. The pump 330 is provided with first inlet&#39;valvem&#39;eans 226 and second inlet valve means 232 whose construction is identical with the first and second inlet valve means of the previously disclosed pump 200 and willnot be described here in detail.  \\n  A rotary drive member 236 is disposed in a cam chamber 73 and is designed to drive a plurality of pumping members 240&#39;to cause the reciprocation of pistons 102and 104 formed integrally with said pumping members and disposed in cylinders (not shown) arranged in first and second banks in the first and second stator plates 336 and 340, respectivelypin a structure identical with-that&#39;previously disclosed in the consideration of the pump 200. As in the previously disclosed pump 200, the cam -chamber 73 is maintained in continual fluid commumcation with the inlet port 35 by means of inlet passage means 306 and outlet passage means 308. Each of the cylinders has associated therewith an outlet check valve 164 identical in construction with the previously disclosed and discussed outlet check valves and designed to perform an identical function.  \\n  The first and second stator plates 336 and 340 are provided with circumferential outlet passages 166, said outlet passages-receiving pressure fluid from the cylinders, not shown, ;whe&#39;n the outlet checkvalves 16.4&#34;are open; .The&#39; pressurefluid from the outlet passages 166 lsdischarged mtoan outlet channel 67 which terminates in an outletgport 68 provided in the&#39;first end plate 334. Thus far the construction of the pump 330 is disting fnstlfiablde from-that of the pump -10, shown-in &#39;Fig. I o e rawings, b the rovision V v and outlet valves, y p ofpoppet type Inlet ous circulation &#39;offluid through the cam &#39;chamber and 1ts;d1rect.&#39; return to the inlet port, and by the. provision of rotary drivemeans 236 and -240-constructed ill-accordby the p&#39;rovision ofmeans-for continu ance with the invention disclosed in the consideration of the-pump 200, that is, incorporating the varied spacings of the cam follower l&#39;obes and &#39;the different sphericities of the cam followerdobes from the sphericities of the cam surfaces 238 provided on the rotary drive member236j j Another distinguishing feature of the construction of the pump 330 over the pump 10 liesin theprovision of a drain chamber 320 which receives pressure&#39;fluid from the second inlet chamber 230 which by-passes the seal 32 and discharges said by-pa ss fluid into a drain port 321 which is connected with an elongated drain channel 345 running the entire length of the housing 332 and terminating in a drain port 346. The drain chamber 3&#39;20&#39;serves the-same function as the drain chamber of the pump 2th and will not be discussed in detail.  \\n  fT here isshown&#39; in Fig. 23 of the drawings a power unit 390 constructed in accordanc with my invention. The&#39;p&#39;o&#39;wer unit 390 includes a primary or motor housmg 392 in which is supported a field coil 393 which encompasses an armature 394 adapted to &#39;be rotated. when said field coil is energized. The motor housing 392 includes first and second end plates 396 -and-397,, respectively, the first end plate 396 being provided with a centrally located opening 398 through which the housing 11 of the above described pumps 10 or 330 is insertable&#39;. The housing 1-1 of the pump 10 is shown as being disposable in the interior of the armature 394 -while it is supported from the motor housing 392 by the first end plate 14 which is secured to the first end plate 396 of the motor housing 392 by means of bolts 401 or similar fasteners. This method of mounting the pump housing 11 within the armature 394 of the motor with which it is associated is facilitated by the location of the inlet, discharge, and drain ports 35, 68, and 121, respectively, in the-first end plate -14 of the pump 10. it is obvious that by so mounting the pump 10 with-its housing 11 disposed in the interior of the armature 394, an extremely compact power unit 390-is achieved.  \\n  Located in the opposite ends of the motor housing 392 adjacent the second end plate 397 is a driving connection 403, said&#39; connection including a substantially cylindrical mounting member 405 which-is secured to or formed integrally with the second end plate 397. Disposed-in the mounting member 405 and supported thereby are ball bearings 407 which are spaced from each other&#39;by means of a sleeve 408. A connector 409 is secured to the interior of -the&#39;armature 394 adjacent the exterior of the&#39;housing 11 of the pump 10 and has a cylindrical portion 411v mounted for rotation in the bearings 407. Thus, therotationof&#39;the armature 394. within the field coil 393 causes the concomitant rotation of the cylindrical portion 411 ofthe connector 409. The right-hand end of the connector 409 is provided with a female spline 412 which is adapted to receive a male spline 413 supported on the outer end of a coupling 415 which is disposed in the interior of the connector 409. The opposite end of the interior of the coupling 415 is provided with a female spline 417 which receives the splined outer end 26 of the drive shaft 25 and thus establishes a driving relationship between the armature 394 and the pump &#39;10. a  \\n  The provision of the driving connection 403 on the interior of the motor housing 392 eliminates the riecessity for cumbersome and complex external driving connections between the armature 394 and the spline&#39;d outer end 2601? the pump 10; As a matter of fact, the armature 394 is supported for rotation on the driving connection 403 between the armature 394 and the pump 10 and the conventional armature shaft is-eliminated, the drive shaft 25 of the pump 10&#39;being aligned with the longitudinal centralaxis of the armature 394.

Heifer, Altadena, Calif., assignor to General Metals Corporation, San Francisco, Calif., a corporation of California Application March 23, 1953, Serial No. 343,966 </p>\\n<p>t 5 Claims. (Cl. 103-173) This invention relates to hydraulic pumps and, more particularly, to a hydraulic pump of the rotary type. </p>\\n<p> Recent advances in hydraulic system designs have necessitated the provision of hydraulicfluid under high pressures for the actuation of various types of hydraulically actuable instruments and devices, necessitating the provision of a pump characterized by high pressure delivery, high speed operation, relatively large volume output and, yet, of exceedingly small size and light weight. It is, therefore, a primary object of my invention to provide a hydraulic pump which is capable of maintaining a relatively large volume of hydraulic fluid under constant high pressure, the flow of fluid from said pump being substantially constant and being relatively free from heavy surge, pulsation, and high pressure peaks. </p>\\n<p> In order to achieve the aforementioned desirable results of large output and high pressure in a relatively small envelope, it is necessary that the component parts of the pump be energized at relatively high speed. When conventional pumps are utilized, the centrifugal force induced in the component portions thereof by such high speed results in rapid wear of the pump, necessitating the frequent dismantling thereof and the replacement of worn parts. t </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a high speed, large volume, high pressure pump in which the various components are so balanced that excessive bearing loads encountered in conventional pumps are eliminated, thus obviating the necessity for replacement of worn parts and for frequent dismantling of the pump. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of a high speed, high pressure pump which includes a plurality of reciprocating pistons, said pistons being actuable by a rotatable drive member associated therewith. An associated object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character in which the rotatable drive member is provided with a cam portion adapted to cause the reciprocation of said pistons. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which there is provided a plurality of banks of cylinders which are spaced from each other, said pump including a plurality of pumping members having provided at their opposite ends pistons adapted to be reciprocated in opposed cylinders of said banks. </p>\\n<p>Another object of my invention is the provision of l a pump having a plurality of spaced banks of opposed cylinders adapted to receive oppositely directed pistons provided upon a plurality of pumping members which are actuable by a rotary cam, the rotation of said cam causing the movement of said pumping members and the reciprocation of said pistons in said cylinders. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which said pumping members, in additionto being reciprocable to cause the reciprocation of said pistons, are rotatable about their axes by\\'therotation of saidvcam, the concomitant rotation ofthe cam and the\\'pumping members 2,925,047 Patented 16, 1960 causing the rotation of said pistons, which serve as journals for the members, to prevent the occurrence of hot spots or hot bands frequently encountered in closely fitted bearings and reducing frictional wear between the pistons and the cylinders in which they both rotate and reciprocate. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the drive cam is so generated that four strokes of each pumping memher are achieved during one revolution of the drive cam. Therefore, excessive pressure surge and pulsations are eliminated at the output of the pump since, in a pump containing seven pumping members, twenty-eight strokes per revolution occur and the pump can operate at speeds exceeding 8000 r.p.m. </p>\\n<p> An additional object\\'of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the positive reciprocation of the pumping members in both directions of movement by the drive cam eliminates the necessity for return devices, such as springs, thus insuring the positive reciprocation of the pumping members and eliminating the possibility that the pumping members may become jammed because of the failure of the return devices. </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the reaction loads of the pumping members on the cam drive are substantially reduced by the symmetrical configuration of the cam which results in substantial dynamic balance of the cam loads axially and radially. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the drive member is provided with a plurality of valve means adapted to control the flow of inlet fluid to the opposed cylinders of opposite banks, the rotation of said drive member causing the concomitant rotation of said valve means. </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which the fluid inlet to the cylinders is controlled by the aforesaid valve means and the discharge from each cylinder is controlled by a poppet valve, resulting in minimum inlet restriction and minimum leakage perimeter of the rotary valve. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type which, because of its cylinder construction and pumping member actuation, causes the cylinder pressure to be gradually elevated to equal the system pressure, thus reducing hydraulic shock and noise. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of an inlet booster adjacent the inlet passage of the pump which pressurizes the inlet fluid prior to its passage into the cylinders of the pump. t </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned type in which inlet line and delivery line surge are reduced to a minimum because of the constant output characteristic of the pump and because of the double acting pumping members provided therein. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character which is provided with a centrally located cam chamber, said cam chamber being adapted to receive fluid under pressure which serves to equalize the temperature between various \"portions of the pump. </p>\\n<p>member which is engageable by a plurality of pumping members, the pumping members being provided with different configurations so that they engage the driving member in different contact zones to reduce the wear on the driving member. </p>\\n<p> acaaow A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump wherein the driving member has a spherically generated drive cam surface provided thereon, said cam surface being engageable by pumping members having spherically generated cam followers provided thereupon, and the contours of the spherically generated cam followers are selected from different segments of a sphere to distribute the load and wear across said drive cam surface. j </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a pump of the aforementioned character wherein the valve means for each of the various cylinders includes an inlet poppet valve located at the inlet end of the cylinder and operable by a pressure differential created across said inlet end. The provision of inlet poppet valves materially reduces the unswept volume of the cylinders which results with rotary valve constructions and improves the self-priming characteristics of the pump. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a simple but dependable poppet valve structure which can be readily assembled and which insures dependable operation at high speeds. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a pump which is operable at high speeds and which can thus be directly driven fromthe high speed generator and other accessory pads on an aircraft engine or from a high speed electric motor, without the necessity of interposing speed reduction means. </p>\\n<p> Another object of my invention is the provision of a power unit which includes a drive motor mounted in a housing and a pump adapted to be driven thereby and located within the armature of said motor. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type which is provided with a first motor housing, said first motor housing including a motor armature and having one end adapted to receive a pump housing, said pump housing being partially encompassed by said armature. </p>\\n<p> An additional object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type in which a wholly enclosed drive is provided at the end of the motor housing opposite the end in which the pump is mounted, thus providing a completely enclosed power unit and eliminating the necessary for external drive connections between the pump and motor. </p>\\n<p> A further object of my invention is the provision of a power unit of the aforementioned type in which the pump component thereof is readily removable from its driven relationship with the motor. </p>\\n<p> Other objects and advantages of my invention will be apparent from the following specification and the accompanying drawings which are for the purpose of illustration only and in which: </p>\\n<p> Fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of a pump constructed in accordance with my invention and taken on the broken line 11 of Fig. 2; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 2 is a transverse, partly sectional view taken on the broken line 22 of Fig. 1; </p>\\n<p>Fig. 3 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 3-3 of Fig. 1;. </p>\\n<p> Fig. 4 is an enlarged, partlysectional view taken on the broken line 44 of Fig. 1; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 5 is an enlarged side elevational view of a valve constructed in accordance with my invention; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 6 is a vertical sectional view illustrating another embodiment of my invention and taken on the broken line 66 of Fig. 7; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 7 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 7-7 of Fig. 6; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 8 is a transverse, reduced, partly sectional view taken on the broken line 8,8 of Fig. 6; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 9 is an enlarged, fragmentary, partly sectional view of one of the discharge check valves incorporated in the pump of my invention; </p>\\n<p>Fig. 10 is a transverse, fragmentary, enlarged, partly 4 sectional view taken on the broken line 10-10 of Fig. 7; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 11 is a vertical sectional view of still another embodiment of my invention; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 12 is a transverse sectional view taken on the broken line 12--12 of Fig. 11; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 13 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view taken on the line 13-13 of Fig. 11; </p>\\n<p>Fig. 14 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view of i a valve means of my invention; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 15 is an enlarged, fragmentary, sectional view taken on the broken line 1515 of Fig. 14; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 16 is an enlarged, transverse, sectional view taken on the broken line 16-16 of Fig. 15; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 17 is a perspective view of a spring seat constructed in accordance with my invention; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 18 shows a spherical configuration of the cam followers on certain of the pumping members; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 19 shows a different spherical configuration of the cam followers on other of the pumping members than Fig. 18; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 20 shows still a different spherical configuration of the cam followers on other of the pumping members than Figs. 18 and 19; </p>\\n<p> Fig. 21 is a development of the drive cam showing the relation of the various follower contact zones there- Fig. 22 is a vertical sectional view of still another embodiment of my invention; and v Fig. 23 is a partly sectional, partly elevational view of a power unit constructed in accordance with my invention. </p>\\n<p> Referring to the drawings, and more particularly to Figspl through 5 thereof, I show a pump 10, said pump being enclosed in a substantially cylindrical housing indicated generally at 11. The housing 11 is constituted by a plurality of sections which are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of elongated bolts 13 which pass through all of said sections to maintain them in the aforesaid operative relationship, as best shown in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawings. </p>\\n<p> Among the sections constituting the pump housing 11 are a combined end plate and mounting flange 14 (which, in addition to other functions to be described in greater detail below, serves to mount the pump 10), a booster plate 16 juxtaposed to said end plate, a first stator plate 18maintained in operative relationship with said booster plate 16, a cam chamber housing 20 interposed between said first stator plate 18 and a second stator plate 22, and an end plate 23 juxtaposed to said second stator plate 22. Mounted centrally of the pump housing 11 and having its longitudinal axis substantially coincident with the longitudinal axis of saidhousing is a drive shaft 25, said shaft having a splined outer end 26 engageable by a driving member, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. Keyed to the drive shaft 25 by means of a shear pin 28 is a hollow rotor 30, said rotor being formed concentrically with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and being rotatable thereby. An oil seal combination 32 prevents the leakage of oil past the end of the drive shaft 25. </p>\\n<p>An inlet port 35 provided by the end plate 14 com-. </p>\\n<p> municates with a supercharger or booster chamber 36, </p>\\n<p>also provided in the end plate 14. A centrifugal type booster impeller 38 located in the chamber 36 is keyed to the end of the drive shaft 25 and is rotatable thereby. The provision of the booster chamber 36 and the booster impeller 38 materially enhances the efficiency of the pump 10 since it insures constant delivery of fluid under constant pressure to the pump. Furthermore, at. high altitudes, where pressure drops are encountered, it prevents the starving of the pump. In addition, the pressure boost self-primes the\\'pump and renders it more efiective on dry-line starting. </p>\\n<p> It should be noted here that the booster chamber 36 constitutes a portionof a fluid inlet passage 40 of the pump. The supercharger or booster plate 16, is provided with a centrally located opening 42, said opening being adapted to receive a cylindrical boss or projection 43 formed on the left-hand sidejof the first stator 18, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, to facilitate the mounting and centering of the booster plate 16. Formed in the booster plate 16 are channels 44 which constitute continuations of the inlet passage 40 and communicate with the booster chamber 36 and a first inlet chamber 48 provided in the first stator plate 18. The booster plate 16 has a centrally located opening 49 in which is located a bushing 50 which serves as a bearing for the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 38. </p>\\n<p> When the hollow rotor 30 is mounted upon the drive shaft 25, an annular, elongated inlet channel 52 exists between the periphery of the drive shaft 25 and the hollow interior of the rotor 30. This annular, elongated inlet channel 52 constitutes a prolongation of the inlet passage 40 and is adapted to receive inlet fluid from the first inlet chamber 48 as it is fed thereinto from the channels 44 in the booster plate 16. The inlet fluid flows through the elongated inlet channel 52 between the drive shaft 25 and the interior of the rotor 30 into a second inlet chamber 54. </p>\\n<p> Formed integrally with the opposite ends of the rotor 30 are first and second valve means 62 and 64 which are located and rotatable in the first and second inlet chambers 48 and 54. Therefore, when the rotor 30 is rotated by the concomitant rotation of the drive shaft 25, thefirst and second valve means 62 and 64 are simultaneous- 1y rotated in the first and second inlet chambers 48 and 54, respectively. </p>\\n<p> Communicating with the first inlet chamber 48 is, a first outlet passage 66 which, in turn, communicates with an outlet channel 67 which terminates in an outlet port 68 provided in the end plate 14. A second outlet passage 70 has one end in communication with the second inlet chamber 54 and its opposite end in communication with the outlet channel 67. A plurality of cylinders 72, as best shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawings, is provided in the first stator plate 18, said cylinders being arranged about the perimeter of a circle concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and having their right-hand ends, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, communicating with a cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 73 provided in the interior of the cam chamber housing 20. Each of the cylinders 72 communicates, at its left-hand end, with a chamber 74, each of the chambers 74 being maintained in communication with the first inlet chamber 48 by means of a passage 75. The cylinders 72 constitute a first bank a of cylinders to which fluid is fed from the first inlet chamber 48 by the first valve means 62, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> The second stator plate 22 is provided with a plurality of cylinders 78 which are also arranged about the perimeter of a circle whose center is concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25, each of the cylinders 78 communicating at its left-hand end with the cam chamber 73 and at its right-hand end with a cylinder chamber 80 which is maintained in communication with the second inlet chamber 54 by means of a passage 81. The cylinders 78 constitute a second bank of cylinders, inlet fluid being fed to the cylinders from the second inlet chamber 54 through the passages 81 by the second valve means 64, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> Each of the cylinder chambers 74 associated with the cylinders 72 of the first bank and each of the cylinder chambers 80 associated with the cylinders 78 of the second bank is provided with a steel plug 83 and retained in position by means of a set screw 84. These plugs prevent the egress of fluid from the cylinder chambers d 80 an y be rsmsYedte Per i e mitt of the cylinder chambers 74 and and the passages 75 and 81 associated therewith. 1 Formed integrally with the. rotor 30 and disposed in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 73 is a rotatable driving member 85 having a cam 86, said cam being operatively engaged with a plurality of pumping members 88 which are also disposed in the chamber 73. The rotatable cam 86 includes first and second cam portions 90 and 91, defining a groove, each of which is provided with at least two rises 92 and two falls 93, the undulated rises 92 on the second cam portion 91, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings, being disposed opposite the undulated falls 93 on the first cam portion 90. It should be noted that the cam portions 90 and 91 of the rotatable cam 86 are spherically generated on a circle indicated at 94, for a purpose which will be described in greater detail below. Each of the pumping members 88 includes a substantially cylindrical head portion 95 which has integrally formed therewith, at opposite ends thereof, enlarged cam follower lobes 97 and 98 which are provided with spherically generated beveled cam follower portions 99 and 100, respectively, engaging, respectively, the spherically generated cam portions 90 and 91 provided on the rotatable cam 86. </p>\\n<p> When the drive shaft 25 is rotated to cause the concomitant rotation of the rotor 30, the cam 86 is simultaneously rotated and the cam portions 90 and 91 move against the cam follower portions 99 and 100 of the cam follower lobes 97 and 98 thus causing the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88. The significance of the spherically generated engaging cam and cam follower surfaces of. the rotatable cam 86 and the cam lobes 97 and 98 at once becomes apparent since the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 causes not only the reciprocation of the pumping member 88 but also the concomitant rotation thereof and thereby preventing seizure and malfunction of piston bearings 102 and 104 which can occur on such closely fitted parts due to localized heat bands. The above mentioned reciprocation and concomitant rotation of the bearing surfaces prevents the generation of localized high temperature spots or bands by dissipating the latter over large areas of the bearing surface. </p>\\n<p> It should be noted here that the provision of the rotatable drive cam 86 with at least two rises 92 and two falls 93 on each of the first and second cam portions 90 and 91 causes each of the pumping members to be reciprocated four times during a single rotation of the rotatable cam 86, thus providing for double acting pumping members and also accomplishing an effective pumping action during rotation of the drive shaft 25. Therefore, when the pump is driven at 8,000 rpm, 32,000 strokes per minute of each of the seven pumping members occur, resulting in a fluid output characterized by the almost total absence of pulsation and pressure surges. </p>\\n<p> Another aspect of the simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88 by the rotatable drive cam 86 through the inter-engagement of the spherically generated cam and cam follower surfaces thereof is the fact that high speed rotation of the drive shaft 25 is permitted and facilitated which would not be the case if the inter-engagement between the rotatable cam 86 and the pumping members 88 were a conventional rubbing cam inter-engagement since the high speeds of the drive shaft 25 would cause not only tremendous frictional losses between the drive cam 86 and the pumping members 88, but would also cause such great Wear that the cam and its associated pumping members would have a relatively short useful life. The engagement between the drive cam 86 and the cam follower portions 99 and of the pumping members 88 is the substantial equivalent of a ball bearing action and is characterized by minimal wear and minimal friction. The manner in which the drive cam surfaces engage the spherically generated surfaces of the pumping members is a most important feature of my in; </p>\\n<p>vention because of the highly desirable results achieved by its utilization. Furthermore, the fact that the driving member 85 is surrounded and partially supported by the pumping members results in substantially dynamic stability and prevents the imposition of unbalanced radial loads on the shaft and the rotor and thus avoids the frictional losses and the wear otherwise attendant thereupon. </p>\\n<p> Each of the pumping members 88 is provided at its opposite ends with opposed pistons 102 and 104, the opposed pistons 102 and 104 being reciprocable and rotatable, respectively, in the opposed cylinders 72 and 78. Therefore, in addition to providing their ordinary functions of permitting the pumping of inlet fluid from the cylinders 72 and 78, the pistons 1-02 and 104 serve as bearing spindles which permit the rotation of the pumping members 88 by the rotatable cam 86. It can readily be perceived that, when the rotation of the cam 86 causes the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 88, the pistons 102 and 104 are simultaneously rotated and reciprocated in the opposed cylinders 72 and 7 8 of the first and second banks of cylinders, the exhaust stroke of one piston being accompanied by a concomitant intake stroke of its opposed piston. </p>\\n<p> The construction of the first and second valve means 62 and 6 5 will now be considered in greater detail, it being understood that since the valve means 62 and 64 are substantially identical in configuration but oppositely oriented with respect to one another, the first valve means 62 only will be described in detail, identical reference numerals being utilized to indicate identical portions of the second valve means 64. As best shown in Figs. 1, 2, 4, and 5, the first valve means 62 is of substantially cylindrical configuration and is provided at one end with an annular exhaust channel 106 which communicates continuously with the first outlet passage 66 and is interposed between said outlet passage 66 and a pair of horizontal exhaust bays 108 and 109 which are disposed on opposite sides of the valve 62. The bays 108 and 109 of the valves 62 and 64 are adapted to communicate, as best shown in Figs. 1, 4, and 5 of the drawings, with the passages 75 and 81 to the cylinder chambers 74 and 80, respectively, thus exhausting pressure fluid from the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 upon the pressure strokes of the pistons 102 and 104, respectively, associated therewith. </p>\\n<p> Also provided in the first valve means 62 is a transverse inlet passage 111 which, as best shown in Figs. 2 and 4 of the drawings, is bisected by the inlet channel 52 between the rotor 30 and the drive shaft 25 and has its ends communicating with inlet bays 112 and 113 on opposite sides of the valve 62 to permit inlet fluid to flow from the inlet channel, through the inlet bays 112 and 113 and into the passages 75 and 81 associated, respectively, with the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 to permit the ingress of fluid to the cylinders 72 and 78. It should be noted here that the second valve means 64, while identical in configuration with the first valve means 62, is not only oppositely oriented with respect to the first valve means 62 so that the inlet passages 111 of the two valves face each other, but is also rotated 90 about the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 so that, as best viewed in Fig. 1 of the drawings, those cylinders which are directly opposed to each other, as in the case of the cylinders 72 and 78 of Fig. 1, will be opened, respectively, to communication with the inlet channel 52 and the exhaust bay 108 in\\'order that fluid may be drawn into the cylinder chamber 74 by the intake stroke of the piston 102 and expelled from the cylinder chamber 80 by the pressure stroke of the piston 104. </p>\\n<p> Therefore, as the rotatable drive cam 86 is rotated by the rotation of the drive shaft 25, the first and second valves 62 and 64 are simultaneously rotated, the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 and the valves 62 and 64 being so coordinated that, when the pumping members 88 are shifted to the right, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the draw-T ings, the inlet passage 111 in the valve 62 registers \"with the cylinders 72 and the cylinder chambers 74 of said cylinders in which the pistons 102 are initiating or pass-j ing through their intake strokes while, on the other hand, the exhaust bays 108 and 109 of the valves 62 an\\'d 64 are registered with those cylinders in which the pistons are completing their pressure strokes so that fluid under pressure may be fed by means of the exhaust bays and the annular exhaust channel 106 into the outlet channel 67. </p>\\n<p>\\' The manner in which the valve 62 controls the flow of inlet fluid and pressure fluid into and from the various cylinders is graphically illustrated in Fig. 2 of the drawings, those arrows which point toward the cylinders.- 72 and away from the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 indicating the flow of inlet fluid from the inlet channel 52 to the inlet passage 111 in the valve 62 and into\" the cylinders 72 in which the pistons 102 are at varying positions in their intake strokes. It will be noted that the arrows which are directed away from the cylinders 72 and toward the center of, the drive shaft 25 indicate the flow of fluid under pressure from the cylinders 72 and into the oppositely disposed exhaust bays 108 and 109 whence the pressure fluid flows into the annular exhaust channel 106 of the valve 62 and thence through the first outlet passage 66 and the outlet channel 67 into the outlet port 68. It is thus apparent that, by the pro-\\' vision of a valve of the configuration disclosed herein, and by the integration of the action of the valve 62 with the valve 64 and the provision of double acting pumping members 88, it is possible to provide a pump characterized by the maintenance of a continuous and uniform high pressure head in which discharge surge is practically eliminated. </p>\\n<p> A by-pass chamber 115 is constituted by a space between the\\' right-end of the second stator plate 22 and the end plate 23, as best shown in Fig. 1 of the drawings. The by-pass chamber 115 is maintained in communication with the cam and temperatureand pressure equalizing chamber 73 by means of a by-pass passage 117 so that pressure fluid leaking past the second valve 64 and the drive shaft 25 may be returned to the chamber 73. The chamber 73 is connected by means of a drain pas: sage 119 to a drain port 121 in the end plate 14, said drain port being, in turn, connected to a reservoir of the fluid being pumped. Since it is intended that the pump 10 will generally be utilized in a closed system, the cam chamber 73 is continually maintained full of fluid at low pressure because of the by-passing of fluid thereinto from the by-pass chamber 115 through the by-pass passage 117 and also because of the leakage past the pistons from the cylinders of the pump. The pressure fluid in the cam chamber 73 serves the valuable function of equalizing the temperature between the various operating components of the pump and also serves as a lubricant and hydraulic cushion for the various operating components of the pump. The end plate 14 contains both the inlet and outlet ports 35 and 68, respectively, permitting the incorporation of the pump 10 in pump and motor combinations in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> Although, in describing the invention as a pump, stress has been laid upon the pumping function thereof, it is obvious that the principles of my invention could be utilized in a motor of somewhat similar structure. </p>\\n<p> Another embodiment of my invention, as shown in Figs. 6-9 of the drawings, is a pump 125 including a housing 126. In describing the pump 125, those portions of the pump 125 which are identical with portions of the previously discussed embodiment will be designated by identical reference numerals for convenience in description and to prevent duplication. The housing 126 is substantially cylindrical in configuration and is constituted by afirst end fitting 128, a first stator plate 130, </p>\\n<p> g aeam chmaber plate 131, a second stator plate 132 and a second end fitting 134. The various components of. the housing are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of bolts 135 extending therethrough. </p>\\n<p> Mounted in the housing 126 and having its longitudinal axis disposed substantially centrally thereof is a drive shaft 25 which is provided with a splined outer end 26 adapted to establish a driving connection with a source of power to cause the operation and rotation of the drive shaft 25. Mounted on the drive shaft 25 and secured thereto by means of a shear pin 28 is a rotor 137, said rotor being rotatable by and concomitantly with the drive shaft 25. Disposed in the second end fitting 134 and encompassing the periphery of the drive shaft 25 is an oil seal combination 32 adapted to prevent the leakage of fluid from the pump around the periphery of the drive shaft 25. </p>\\n<p> The first end fitting 128 provides an inlet port 139 .which communicates with a booster chamber 140, it being understood that the inlet and booster chambers 139 and 140, respectively, constitute portions of a fluid inlet passage 141, the other components of which will be described subsequently. Disposed in the booster chamber 140 is a booster impeller 142 which is secured to the left-hand end of the drive shaft 25, as shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings, and which is adapted to boost the pressure of the inlet fluid as it passes through the booster chamber 140. Disposed in the first end fitting 128 and supported thereby against the left-hand face of the first stator plate 130 is a booster plate 143 which defines one wall of the booster chamber 140 and is provided with a plurality of vertical inlet openings 144. The booster plate 143 has a centrally located opening 146 provided therein in which is mounted a bushing 147 for supporting the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 142. </p>\\n<p> The rotor 137 is hollow for the major portion of its length and has its interior wall spaced from the periphery of the drive shaft 25 to define an elongated inlet channel 149 which constitutes a portion of the fluid inlet passage 141 and communicates at its left-hand end, as best shown inFig. 6 of the drawings, with the inlet openings 144 in the booster plate 143. A first inlet chamber 152 is provided in the first stator plate 130 and is lined with a sleeve or bushing 153 which encompasses a first valve means 154 formed integrally with the left-hand end of the rotor 137. A second inlet chamber \\'156 is provided in the second stator plate 132, said second inlet chamber being lined by a sleeve or bushing 157 which receives a second valve means 158 formed integrally with the righthand end of the rotor 137, as best shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings. </p>\\n<p>Since the first and second valve means 154 and 158 are of identical construction with the exception that their positions at the opposite ends of the rotor 137 are reversed and the second valve means 158 is rotated 90 about the axis of the drive shaft 25, the description of the first valve means 154 will apply with equal cogency to the description of the second valve means 158, like portions of the second valve means 158 being designated by identical reference numerals utilized in designated like portions of the first valve means 154. The first valve means 154 is provided with a transverse inlet port 160 which communicates with the elongated inlet channel149 in the rotor 137 and is adapted to transfer inlet fluid from said channel through inlet orifices 162 in the sleeve \\'153 which cormnunicate with the passages 75 between the first inlet chamber 152 and the cylinder chambers 74 of the cylinders 72, thus permitting inletvfluid to flow into the cylinder chambers 74 and to be acted upon by the pistons 102 therein. Similarly, fluid flows through the transverse inlet port 160 in the second valve means 158 through the passages 81 communicating with the cylinder chambers 80. </p>\\n<p>Since the constructions of the rotatable drive cam 86 and the pumping members 88 are identical with the son structions of these components in the previously discussed embodiment of my invention, they will not be referred to in detail herein, it being understood that the rotation of the rotatable cam 86 and the first and second valve means 154 and 158, respectively, is synchronized with the reciprocation of the pumping members 88 and the pistons 102 and 104 associated therewith so that the first and second valve means 154 and 158 are appropriately disposed when the pistons 102 and 104 are reciprocated by the action of the rotatable cam 86, so that inlet fluid may be fed into the cylinder chambers associated therewith at the appropriate moment. </p>\\n<p> One of the major distinctions between the pump of my invention and the previously discussed pump 10 of my invention is the manner in which pressure fluid is fed from the cylinder chambers 74 and 810, respectively, by the action of the pistons 102 and 104, respectively. Each of the cylinder chambers 74 and 80* communicates with a check valve 164, at best shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 9 of the drawings, which permits pressure fluid to be fed into a substantially circumferential outlet passage 166 when the pressure of the fluid reaches a predetermined value. </p>\\n<p> Each of the check valves 164, as best shown in Fig. 9 of the drawings, includes a plug 168 which is threadedly engaged in a bore 169 formed in the periphery of the first stator plate 130. The plug 168 provides a valve guide 169 in which is disposed the stem 170 of a poppet type valve 171 which seats on a seat 172 toprevent the flow of pressure fluid from an associated cylinder chamber 74 until the pressure of the fluid reaches a value sufficient to overcome the compression of a spring 175 encompassing the valve guide 169\\' and biasing the valve 171 on the seat 172. The plug 168 is provided with a plurality of drainage ports 176 adjacent the base of the valve guide 169 to permit pressure fluid seeping between the periphery of the valve stem 170 and the interior of the valve guide 169\\' to be drained off and prevent it from locking the stem 170 and thus preventing the movement of the poppet valve 171. The plug 168 is also provided with a transverse port 177 registering with the bore of the outlet passage 166 to permit free flow of outlet fluid therepast. </p>\\n<p> Therefore, when, as best shown in Fig. 7 of the drawings, the body of the first valve means 154 blocks the inlet passages 75 to the cylinder chambers 74 and the pistons 102 arebeing driven into the cylinders 72, the pressure of the fluid is elevated to a point where the poppet valves 171 are driven off their seats 172 to permit the egress of pressure fluid into the circumferential outlet passage 166. The circumferential outlet passage 166 communicates with a main outlet passage 178 which, in turn, feeds the pressure fluid into an outlet port 179 on the cam plate 131. It should be noted here that the second stator plate 132 is provided with an identical circumferential outlet passage 166 which also communicates with the main outlet passage 178. It is, therefore, apparent that the pressure fluid is fed from the various cylinder chambers of the pump 125 as the rotation of the first and second valve means 154 and 158 causes the various cylinder chambers to be sealed and permits the pressure in the cylinder chambers to rise to a value which will overcome the check valves 164. Since the discharge of pressure fluid from the cylinder chambers is controlled by check valves, minimum inlet restriction is encountered and minimum leakage about the perimeter of the first and second valve means 154 and 158 occurs. </p>\\n<p> It may be noted here that the rotary cam 86 and the pumping members 88 are disposed in a cam and pressure chamber 180 which is adapted to receive inlet fluid through a passage 182 which communicates at one end, as best shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings, with one of the openings 144 in the booster plate 143 and is thus adapted to transmit boosted inlet fluid directly to the interior of the cam and pressure.chamber.180. The flow of. islet 11 fluid through the passage 182 is controlled by a ball check 183 which seats on a seat 184 by means of a compression spring 185. When the pressure of the fluid in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 130 is less than the pressure of the boosted inlet fluid passing through the opening 144 in the booster plate 143, the pressure differential between the chamber 180 and the opening 144 permits the ball check 183 to be driven off 1ts seat 184 and the passage of boosted inlet fluid into the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamher 180 is thus permitted. However, when the pressure of the fluid in the chamber 180 rises above the pressure of the boosted inlet fluid, the pressure differential between the fluid in the chamber 130 and the boosted inlet fluid 1n the opening 144 in the booster plate 143 causes the ball check 183 to be seated on the seat 184. Of course, the compression spring 135 can be so calculated that a pressure differential of a desired maximum value must be achieved between the chamber 180 and the opening 144 in the booster plate 143 before the ball check 183 can be driven off its seat 184 or, conversely, can be so calculated that a minimum pressure differential is necessary to cause the ball check to be driven off its seat. </p>\\n<p> Another source of pressure fluid for the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 180 is provided by a by-pass chamber 186 in the second end fitting 134, said by-pass chamber being connected to and maintained in communication with the chamber 180 by a by-pass passage 187. When the pressure fluid in the chamber 18!) increases beyond the capacity of the chamber 180, it is drained off through a drain port 189 on the unders de of the cam and fluid pressure plate 131 and contrnuous circulation of the fluid through the chamber is thus accomplished. </p>\\n<p> As previously indicated in the discussion of the pump 10, the presence of pressure fluid in the cam and temperature and pressure equalizing chamber 180 equalizes the temperature between the various operating components located in the chamber, acts as a hydraulic cushion for the componentoperating parts and also serves to drain fluid by-passed about the various operating parts to prevent leakage at theexterior of the pump 125. </p>\\n<p> Since there is a possibility that particles of metal from poorly filtered fluid may enter the chamber 180, there is provided in the second stator plate 132, as best shown in Figs. 7 and 10 of the drawings, an opening 191 which provides a mounting for a sleeve 192 in which is located a cylindrical, magnetic element 123, the forward end of which projects into the chamber 181) and is adapted to gather upon its surface particles of iron and steel which are present in the pressure fluid in the chamber 180 so that the particles wili not remain in circulation in the chamber with possible damage to the mechanism. </p>\\n<p> Another embodiment of my invention, as shown in Figs, 11-21 of the drawings, is constituted by a pump 2% which includes a housing 201. In describing. the pump 2%, those portions thereof which are identical with portions of the previously discussed embodiments of the invention will be designated by identicalreference numerals for convenience in description and to avoid duplication. It should be noted that the pump 200 is, in many details of construction, quite similar to the pump 125 shown in Figs. 6-9 of the drawings and described in detail hereinbefore. </p>\\n<p> The housing 201is substantially cylindrical in configuration and is constituted by a first end fitting 202, a first stator plate 204, a cam chamber plate 206, a second stator plate 208, and a second end fitting 210. The various components of the housing are maintained in operative relationship with one another by means of bolts 211 extending therethrough. </p>\\n<p> Mounted in the housing 201 and having its longitudinal axis disposed substantially centrally thereof, is a drive shaft 25 which is provided with a splined outer end 26 adapted to establish a driving connection with a source 12 of power to cause the operation and rotation of the drive shaft 25. Mounted on the drive shaft 25 and secured thereto by means of a shear pin \\'28 is a rotor\\'214, said rotor being rotatable by and concomitantly with thedr\\'ive shaft 2 5. Disposed in the second endfitting 208 and encompassing the periphery of the drive shaft 25 is-an oil seal combination 32 for preventing major-leakage of fluid from the pump around the periphery of the drive shaft 25. However, the oil seal combination 32 which has been schematically shown in Fig. 6 of the drawings is adapted to by-pass pressure fiuid when the pressures encountered in the pump housing 201 reach extremely high levels, as will be described in detail hereinafter. </p>\\n<p> The first end fitting 202 provides an inlet port 139 which communicates with a booster chamber 140, it being understood that the inlet 139 and the booster chamber 140 constitute portions of a fluid inlet passage 141, the other components of which will be described below. Disposed in the booster chamber 140 is a booster impeller 216 which is secured to the left-hand end of the drive shaft 25, as shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, and which is adapted to boost the pressure of the inlet fluid as it passes through the booster chamber 140. Disposed in the first end fitting 202, and supported therein in spaced relationship with the left-hand wall of the first stator plate 204 by means of dowels 217 which are secured in a mounting plate 218 juxtaposed to the stator plate 204, is a booster plate 220 which acts as a stator with respect to the booster impeller 216 associated therewith. The space between the booster plate 220 and the mounting plate 218 therefor constitutes a first, vertical inlet chamber 222. The booster plate 220 has a centrally located opening 223 provided therein in which is mounted a bushing 224 for supporting the end of the drive shaft 25 adjacent the booster impeller 216. v </p>\\n<p> The rotor 214 is hollow for the major portion of its length and has its interior wall spaced from the periphery of the drive shaft 25 to define an elongated inlet channel 149 which constitutes a portion of the fluid inlet passage 141 and communicates, at its left-hand end, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, with the vertical inlet chamber 222 between the mounting plate 218 and the booster plate 220. </p>\\n<p> Communicating with the first inlet chamber 222 is first inlet valve means 226, said first inlet valve means being exposed to the full flow of fluid from the booster impeller 216 prior to the entry thereof into the elongated inlet channel 149 in the rotor 214. A plurality of outlet ports 228 are provided in the right-hand end of the rotor 214, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, which communicate continuously with channels 229 formed in the Second stator plate 208 which, in turn, are maintained in continuous communication with a second inlet chamber 230 provided in the second end fitting 210. Therefore, the inlet fluid pressurized by passage through the booster impeller 216 flows through the first inlet chamber 222 into the elongated inlet channel 149 defined by the interior of the rotor 214 and the periphery of the drive shaft 25. From the elongated inlet channel 149 the fluid flows through the radially oriented ports 228 in the right-hand end of the rotor 214 and into the second inlet chamber 230. Disposed in fluid communication with the second inlet chamber 230\\' are second inlet valve means 232, said second inlet valve means 232 being constantly subjected to fluid pressure in the second inlet chamber 239 because of the constant communication of the second inlet chamber 230 with the first inlet chamber 222. </p>\\n<p> A plurality of cylinders 72, as best shown in Figs. 11 and 12 of the drawings, is provided in the first stator plate 204, said cylinders being arranged about the perimeter of a circle concentric with the longitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25 and having their right-hand ends, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, communicating 13 with a cam and pressure-equalizing chamber 73 provided in the interior of the cam chamber plate 206. Each of the. cylinders 72 is disposable in fluid communication with the first inlet chamber 222 by means of the first inlet valve means 226, the first inlet valve means 226 controlling the flow of inlet fluid into the cylinder chambers 74. of the cylinders 72 in a manner which will be described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> The cylinders 72 constitute a first bank of cylinders into which inlet fluid is fed and from which pressure fiuid is discharged, each of the cylinders 72 being lined with a bronze or brass bushing 234 to provide a bearing surface in the interior of each of the cylinders 72 for a purpose\\'which will be described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> The second stator plate 208 is provided with a plurality of cylinders 78 which are also arranged about the perimeter of a circle whose center is concentric with the lon gitudinal axis of the drive shaft 25, each of the cylinders 78 communicating at its left-hand end with the cam chamber 73 and at its right-hand end being disposed in fluid communication with the second inlet chamber 230 through the second inlet valve means 232. Each of the cylinders 78 incorporates a cylinder chamber 80 and is provided with a brass or bronze bearing bushing 234. The cylinders 78 constitute a second bank of cylinders, </p>\\n<p>said second bank of cylinders being disposed on the opposite side of the chamber 73 from the first bank of cylinders previously described. </p>\\n<p> Formed integrally with the rotor 214 and disposed in the cam, temperature, and pressure-equalizing chamber 73 is a rotatable driving member 236 having a spherically generated cam surface 238, said cam surface 238 being \\'operatively engaged with a plurality of pumping members, indicated generally at 240, which are also disposed in the chamber 73. </p>\\n<p> The rotatable cam surface 238, as best shown in Figs. 11 and l8-2l of the drawings, includes first and second cam portions 242 and 243, each of which is provided with at least two rises 245 and two falls 246, the undulated rises 245 on the second cam portion 243 being disposed opposite the undulated falls 246 on the first cam portion 242. It should be noted that the first and second cam portions 242 and 243 are spherically generated in the same manner as the cam portions on the drive members of the previously discussed embodiments of the invention to accomplish the same desirable purposes pre- \\'viously adverted to in the description of the drive memtionships with respect to the spherically generated cam surface 238 of the driving member 236 and are also, as </p>\\n<p>will be described in greater detail below, individually generated on spheres of different diameters to accomplish certain desirable results which will be indicated hereinbelow. </p>\\n<p> As best shown in Figs. 18-20 of the drawings, a first pumping member 249 is provided with relatively closely spaced cam follower lobes 250, a second pumping member 251 is provided with cam follower lobes 252 which i are more widely spaced than the cam follower lobes 250 of the pumping member 249, while a third pumping member 253 is provided with the most widely spaced cam gfollower lobes 254, it being noted that the spacing of the lobes on the various pumping members is accomplished Ebythe variation in the length of the intermediate cylinfc drical section 256 of each of the pumping members. </p>\\n<p> 14 Due to the different spacings of the cam follower lobes 250, 252, and 254, respectively, the surface of the drive cam 238 is contacted in three major zones; an inner zone 258, an intermediate zone 260, and an outer zone 262. </p>\\n<p>Therefore, the most closely spaced cam follower lobes 250 will have their surfaces engage the spherically generated drive cam surface 238 of the rotatable driving member 236 on the inner zone 258, the cam lobes 252 and 254 of the pumping members 251 and 253, respectively, being disposed, respectively, in engagement with the intermediate and outer contact zones 260 and 262, </p>\\n<p> Of course, due to the limited transverse area of the drive cam surface 238, the zones of contact of the various cam follower lobes overlap, to a certain extent, but the major areas of contact are distinguishable, one from the other. </p>\\n<p> By providing pumping members having cam follower lobes which engage the drive cams on the rotatable drive member 236 in different contact zones, it is possible to materially reduce the wear on the drive cam surface 238 in addition to materially equalizing any wear that may occur because all of the load on the drive cam surface 238 is not concentrated in a single zone but is equally distributed across the entire surface of the drive cam. </p>\\n<p> Furthermore, in addition to providing cam lobes which are spaced at different distances with respect to each other, I provide cam follower lobes whose spherical configuration is slightly different from the spherical configuration of the drive cam so that substantially linear contact between the cam follower lobe surfaces and the drive cam surface is achieved. This is illustrated in Figs. l8-20 by the lines 264, 265, and 266, respectively, to indicate that contact is being made between the respective cam follower lobes 250, 252, and 254 in line contact. It should be noted that the spherical deviation of the respective cam follower lobes from the spherical configuration of the drive cam surface 238 is relatively minute so that, while the major portion of the contact load is transmitted to the cam followers through a line contact, the remainder of the surfaces of the cam followers are in substantial contact with the drive cam surface 238. As </p>\\n<p>previously indicated in discussing the different spacing of the cam follower lobes, the provision of cam follower lobes whose sphericity is slightly different from the sphericity of the drive cam prevents significant overlapping of the contact zones of the respective cam follower lobes and results in equalization and material reduction of wear on both the cam follower lobes and the drive cam itself. </p>\\n<p> In order to accomplish the most effective distribution of wear on the drive cam surface 238, the various pumping members are so arranged in relation to one another that, as best shown in Fig. 12 of the drawings, adjacent pumping members all have different contact zones on the drive cam surface 238. For instance, the pumping member 249 is juxtaposed to the pumping member 251 which is, in turn, juxtaposed to the pumping member 253 which is, in turn, juxtaposed to a pumping member 251. The different spacings of the cam follower lobes, the generation of slightly different sphericities on the cam follower lobes from the sphericity of the drive cam surface and the interspersing of pumping members whose lobes are differently spaced and/or generated on spheres of different diameters are most important features of my invention because they materially reduce the wear which one would expect to encounter at the tremendously high speeds of operation of the pump 200 and, also, serve to reduce the frictional heat which one would expect to encounter at such high speeds, materially enhancing and prolonging the life of the pump and improving the operational characteristics thereof. </p>\\n<p> When the-drive shaft 25 is rotated to cause the concomitant rotation of the rotor 214, the driving member 236 is simultaneously rotated and the cam surface 238 thereof moves against the cam follower portions of the configuration. </p>\\n<p>\\'15 and 16 of the drawings. </p>\\n<p>pumping members 249, 251 and 253, respectively, thus imparting thereto both rotary and longitudinal movement for a purpose which will be described in greater detail below. As indicated in the consideration of the previously discussed embodiment of my invention, the spherical generation of both the drive cam surface 238 and the spherical generation of the cam follower lobes which are disposed in driven relationship therewith, provide substantially ball bearing characteristics materially reducing the frictional wear encountered and frictional heat which might normally be expected in constructions of the character under consideration. </p>\\n<p> Each of the pumping members 240 is provided at its opposite end with opposed pistons 102 and 104, said pistons being reciprocable and rotatable, respectively, in the opposed cylinders 72 and 78 and, more particularly, in the bushings 234 disposed in and lining the walls of said cylinders. Therefore, in addition to their ordinary function of pumping inlet fluid from the cylinders 72 and 78, the pistons 102 and 104 serve as bearing spindles which permit the rotation of the pumping members 240 by the rotatable drive member 236. It can readily be perceived that, when the rotation of the drive member 236 causes the concomitant rotation and reciprocation of the pumping members 240, the pistons 102 and 104 are simultaneously rotated and reciprocated in the bushings 234 lining the opposed cylinders 72 and 78 of the first and second banks of cylinders, the exhaust stroke of one piston being accompanied by a concomitant intake stroke of its opposed piston. The simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the pistons 102 and 104 in the cylinders 72 and 78, respectively, prevent the formation of hot bands on the pistons since the rotation thereof dissipatcs heat generated by the movement of said pistons throughout the entire wall of each cylinder and obviates, </p>\\n<p>the possibility that localized over-heated areas may occur. </p>\\n<p> The construction of the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 will now be considered in greater detail, it being understood that since the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 are substantially identical in configuration, but oppositely oriented with respect to one another, the first inlet valve means 226 only will be described in detail, identical reference numerals being applied to indicate identical portions of the second inlet valve means 232. As best shown in Figs. 14 and 15 of the drawings, the first inlet valve means 226 is of the poppet valve type and includes a poppet valve 270 which is mounted and reciprocable in a combination guide and seat member 272 which is of substantially cylindrical The combination seat and guide member 272 is disposed in the left-hand end of the cylinder 72 internally of the bushing 234, as best shown in Figs. 14 and 15 of the drawings, and includes, at its extreme lefthand end, a centrally located valve guide 274 which encompasses the stem 275 of the poppet valve 270 and prevents lateral deflection of said stem within the member 272. Provided on the extreme right-hand end of the member 272 is a valve seat 276, said seat being engageable by the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 to prevent inlet of fluid into the valve chamber 74 and outlet of fluid from said valve chamber. I </p>\\n<p> It will be noted that, as best shown in Fig. 15 of the drawings, an overlapping portion 279 of the mounting plate 218 engages the combined guide and seat member, 272 to prevent its dislocation from the end of the bushing 23 It should also be noted that the member 272 is provided with an elongated inlet channel 281 which is maintained in constant communication with the first inlet chamber 222. </p>\\n<p> Provided adjacent the end of the stern 275 is a pair of oppositely disposed notches 283, best shown in Figs. A spring seat member or retainer 284 is mounted on the end of the stem 275, said member including\\'an arcuate top portion 285 which has forr\\'ned integrally therewith depending arcuate side por- 1\\'6 tions 287, the lowermost ends of which constitute retaining fingers 289 receivable in the oppositely disposed notches 283 on the stem 275. I </p>\\n<p> The top portion 285 and the depending side portions 287 of the spring seat member 284 define an elongated cavity 291 and the top portion 285 is provided with overhanging ends 293 which serve as spring seats 295. A substantially cylindrical keeper or retainer 296 is dise posed in the elongated cavity 291 and is provided with a centrally located recess 297 which receives the outermost end of the valve stem 275 of the poppet valve 270. A fluid by-pass port 299 is provided in the top portion 285 of the spring seat member 284 to permit by-passing of pressure fluid entrapped in the elongated cavity 291. </p>\\n<p> Encompassing the valve stem 275 and having its outermost or left-hand end, as best shown in Fig. 15 of the drawings, seated on the spring seat 295 provided by the spring seat member 284 is a compression spring 302, the opposite or right-hand end of the spring 302 being seated on a spring seat 303 provided on the combined guide and seat member 272, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings. By the provision of the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 in the form of poppet valves, frictional wear and possible seizure which may be encountered with rotary valves of the character incorporated in the previously discussed embodiments of my invention are eliminated. Furthermore, the unswept volume of the cylinder chambers 74 and is reduced to a minimum. </p>\\n<p> The compression spring 302 normally biases the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 on the seat 276 provided on the combined guide and seat member 272, thereby preventing the ingress or egress of fluid from the cylinder chamber 74 through the inlet passage 281 in the member 272. However, when the piston 102 is moved by the pumping member 240 with which it is integrally formed through its exhaust stroke into the position shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, a negative pressure area is created in the cylinder chamber 74 across the head 277 of the poppet valve 270. This negative pressure, coupled with the positive pressure imposed upon the other side of the valve by the boosted pressure fluid in the first inlet chamber 222, overcomes the bias of the compression spring 302 permitting the head 277 of the poppet valve 270 to move out of engagement with the seat 276 and permitting the inflow of fluid into the cylinder chamber 74. When the piston 102 starts its return or pumping stroke in which it moves toward the lefthand end of the cylinder, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, the poppet valve 270 is seated on the seat 276 to prevent the egress of pressure fluid therepast into the inlet channel 281. It is readily apparent, therefore, that the operation of the first inlet valve means and, more particularly, the poppet valve 270 constituting an essential portion thereof, is directly responsive to the energization of the piston with which it is associated and is attributable both to the action of the piston and to the positive pressure exerted thereupon by the inlet fluid passing into the first inlet chamber 222 from the booster impeller 216. The provision of poppet-type valve means for the first and second inlet valve means eliminates the disadvantages of rotary-type valve means such as binding and high frictional losses and, furthermore, reduces the unswept volume of the cylinder chambers to a minimum, the unswept volume being defined as that volume of \\'the cylinder chamber which is not traversed by the reciprocation of the piston. The unswept volume of the cylinder chambers can be materially reduced since there is no necessity for providing the elongated entry and exit ports which must necessarily be provided with rotary-type valve means as is clear from the previously discussed embodiment of the invention. Therefore, since the relatively large volume of inlet and outlet channels to and from the cylinder chamber which is found when rotary valves are. utilized is eliminated by the use of direct valving means such as the poppet valve means described above, more effective pumping action may be achieved and operation of the pump with lower leakage losses, due to positive inlet and outlet valving, may be obtained. </p>\\n<p> It should also be noted that the construction of the first and second inlet valve means by my invention is characterized by ease of assembly, minimum number of parts, and relatively long life. In the first place, the assembly of the valve structure is accomplished by the insertion of the poppet valve 270 in the member 272, the compression spring 302 then being placed on the seat 303 on the member 272. The keeper 296 is then placed over the outer end of the stem 275 of the valve 270, the end of the stem being received in the centrally located recess in said keeper, and the spring seat member 284 is then secured to the end of the stern 275 by slidable engagement of the retaining fingers 289 with the oppositely disposed notches 283 on the opposite sides of the stem 275. By means of this relatively simple and compact assembly, the spring seat member 284 is secured against inadvertent displacement from the end of the stem 275 but, neverthe less, can be easily installed or voluntarily removed when necessary. </p>\\n<p> Thus, as the driving member 236 is rotated in the cam chamber 73, the simultaneous rotation and reciprocation of the associated pumping members 240 is accomplished thereby, causing the concomitant reciprocation and rotation of the oppositely disposed pistons 102 and 104 formed integrally therewith. As indicated previously, the configuration of thedrive cam surface 238 on the rotary driving member 236 causes the pumping members 240 to be reciprocated four times during each rotation of the driving member, resulting in four strokes per member or twenty-eight strokes for each revolution of the driving member 236 in a pump suchas the pump 200 which is provided with seven pumping members. </p>\\n<p> It should be noted that the pump 200 is provided with outlet check valve means 164 installed in each of the cylinder chambers 74 and 80 which check valve means are substantially identical with the check valve means previously shown and discussed in the disclosure of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 6, 7, and 9 of the drawings. The check valve means 164 permits pressure fluid to be fed from the individual cylinder chambers under the action of the associated pistons into substantially circumferential outlet passages 166 when the pressure of the fluid in the individual cylinder chambers reaches a predetermined value. </p>\\n<p> Of course, circumferential outlet passages 166 are located in both the first stator plate 204 and the second stator plate 208, the first outletpassage 166 in the first stator plate collecting the outlet fluid from the first bank of cylinders and the second outlet passage 166 in the second stator plate 208 collecting the outlet fluid from the second bank of cylinders. </p>\\n<p> Since the construction of each of the outlet check valves is identical, only one of the outlet check valves 164 in the first stator plate 204, as best shown in Fig. 14 of the drawings, will be described. Each of the check valves\\'164 includes a plug 168 which is threadedly engaged in a bore 169 formed in the first stator plate 204, the bore 169 continuing inwardly to traverse the fluid outlet passage 166 and terminate in communication with a cylinder chamber 74. The plug \\'168 provides a valve guide 169\\' in which is disposed the stem 170 of a poppet-type valve 171which seats on a seat 172 to prevent flow of pressure fluid from .itsassociated cylinder chamber 74 until the pressure of the fluid, under the action of the piston 102, reaches a value suflicient to overcome. the compression of a spring 175 encompassing the valve guide 169\\' and biasing the valve 171 on the seat 172. The plug 168is provided with a plurality of drainage ports 176 adjacent the base of the valve guide 169\\' to permit pressure fluid seeping between the periphery of the valve stem 170 and theinterior of the valve guide 169\\' to be drained otr 18- and prevented from looking the valve stem and thus preventing the movement of the poppet valve 171. </p>\\n<p> The plug 168 is also provided with a transverse port 177 registering with the bore of the outlet passage 166 to permit free flow of outlet fluid therepast. Therefore, when the piston 102 initiates its pumping stroke and thus seats the inlet poppet valve 270 to prevent the egress of fluid from the cylinder chamber \\'74 past the poppet valve 270, the pressure of the fluid in the cylinder chamber 74 is elevated to a point where the poppet valve 171 is driven off its seat 172 to permit the egress of pressure fluid into the circumferential outlet passage 166. </p>\\n<p> The circumferential outlet passage 166 communicates with a main outlet passage 178 which, in turn, feeds the pressure fluid into an outlet port 179 in the cam plate 206. In this manner, pressure fluid is fed from both outlet passages 166 in the stator plates 204 and 208, respectively, into the opposite ends of the main outlet passage 178. Pressure fluid is thus fed from the various cylinder chambers of the pump 200 and the first and second inlet valve means 226 and 232 are closed and the outlet check valve means 164 are opened by the increase in pressure of the fluid\\'in the various cylinder chambers. Since the inlet and discharge of fluid into and from the cylinder chambers are controlled by poppet-type valves, minimum inlet and outlet restriction is encountered and minimum leakage loss due to inadequate valving occurs. </p>\\n<p> Inorder that the cam chamber 73 may be continuously subjected to a constant flow of pressure fluid to accomplish both heat transfer from the rotatable drivingmember 236 audits associated pumping members 240, and alsov to lubricate the same, a pressure inlet passage 306 is provided in the first stator plate 204, as best shown in Fig. 11 of the drawings, one end of said pressure passage being maintained in communication with the pressure inlet chamber 222, while the other end thereof communicates with the cam chamber 73. </p>\\n<p> In the previously discussed embodiments of my invention, the return fluid from the cam chamber 73 has been returned-to the reservoir, butin the presently discussed embodiment of my invention, as best shown in Fig. 13 of the drawings, I have provided a fluid return passage 308 which communicates directly with the fluid inlet port .139. and thus returns fluid from the chamber 73 directlyto the inlet port 139. By the above described construction, continuous circulation of lubricating and cooling fluid through the cam chamber 73 is accomplished and the additional port provided in the housings of the previously discussed embodiments of my invention for the return of the fluid. from the cam chamber 73 has been eliminated, thus providing an external housing with only the major inlet and outlet ports 139 and 179 and also accomplishing the: elimination of a return line to the reservoir. </p>\\n<p> The aforementioned seal 32 at the right-hand of the drive shaft 25 includes a rotatable sealing member 311 which directly engages the end of the rotor 214 on the shaft 25 and which is biased into operative relationship therewith by means of a compression spring 313. The rotatablesealing member 311 is engaged by a sealing ring 315\\'which is backed up by a collar 317 which is, in turn, biased into engagement with the ring 315 by means of a spring washer 319. This resilient sealing construction embodied in the seal 32 is interposed between the second inlet fluid chamber 230 and a drain chamber 320 so that any fluid by-passing the seal 32may be received in. the drain chamber 320 and conducted therefrom through a drain passage 321 to a drain port 322 whence the fluid may be discharged to atmosphere or to a drain tank or, if desired, returned to the reservoir. </p>\\n<p> An alternative embodiment of my invention is shown in Fig. 22 of the drawings and is exemplified in a pump 330, the housing structure of which is somewhat similar in characterto that of the pump shown in Figs. </p>\\n<p> 19 1-4 of the drawings, but the valving structure of\\'which is substantially identical with that of the pump 200 discussed irnm\\'ediately \\'hereinabove; \\'Therefore, in describing the construction of the pump 330, identical reference numerals will be applied to those portions of the structure which are identical with portions of the premeans of bolts 13. Among the sections constituting the housing 332 are a first combined mounting and end plate 334, a first stator plate 336, an intermediate cam chamber housing plate 338, a second \\'stator plate 340, and second end plate 342. Mounted centrally of\\'the housing 332 and having its longitudinal axis\\'substantially coincident with the longitudinal aXis of said housing is\\'a drive shaft 25, said sh\\'afthaving a splined end 26 engageable by a driving member, in\\'a manner which willbe described in greater detail below. </p>\\n<p> A retort 214 identical-with the previously discussed rotor of the pump 200 is mounted on the\\'shaft\\'25 for rotation therewith. An oil seal 32 is provided at the right-hand end of the housing, as best shown in Fig. 22 of the drawings, to preventleakage of oil from the interior of the pump 330. </p>\\n<p> 1 An inlet port35 communicates witha\\'booster chamber 36, both the inlet port and booster chamber being provided in the first end plate\\'334. Disposed in the booster chamber 36 is \\'aL-centrifugal-type booster impeller 38*which is keyed to\\'the left-handjend of the drive shaft 25 for rotation thereby. A booster plate 37 cooperates with the booster impeller 38 and permits boosted inlet fluid to be-fed into a first inlet fluid chamber 222 whence it is permitted to flow into an elongated inlet channel 149-p r ovi ded between the interior of the rotor 214 andthe periphery of the drive shaft 25. </p>\\n<p> The inlet fluid flows from the channel 149 through ports 229 at\\' the end of the rotor 214 into a second nlet chamber 230. The pump 330 is provided with first inlet\\'valvem\\'eans 226 and second inlet valve means 232 whose construction is identical with the first and second inlet valve means of the previously disclosed pump 200 and willnot be described here in detail. </p>\\n<p> A rotary drive member 236 is disposed in a cam chamber 73 and is designed to drive a plurality of pumping members 240\\'to cause the reciprocation of pistons 102and 104 formed integrally with said pumping members and disposed in cylinders (not shown) arranged in first and second banks in the first and second stator plates 336 and 340, respectivelypin a structure identical with-that\\'previously disclosed in the consideration of the pump 200. As in the previously disclosed pump 200, the cam -chamber 73 is maintained in continual fluid commumcation with the inlet port 35 by means of inlet passage means 306 and outlet passage means 308. Each of the cylinders has associated therewith an outlet check valve 164 identical in construction with the previously disclosed and discussed outlet check valves and designed to perform an identical function. </p>\\n<p> The first and second stator plates 336 and 340 are provided with circumferential outlet passages 166, said outlet passages-receiving pressure fluid from the cylinders, not shown, ;whe\\'n the outlet checkvalves 16.4\"are open; .The\\' pressurefluid from the outlet passages 166 lsdischarged mtoan outlet channel 67 which terminates in an outletgport 68 provided in the\\'first end plate 334. Thus far the construction of the pump 330 is disting fnstlfiablde from-that of the pump -10, shown-in \\'Fig. I o e rawings, b the rovision V v and outlet valves, y p ofpoppet type Inlet ous circulation \\'offluid through the cam \\'chamber and 1ts;d1rect.\\' return to the inlet port, and by the. provision of rotary drivemeans 236 and -240-constructed ill-accordby the p\\'rovision ofmeans-for continu ance with the invention disclosed in the consideration of the-pump 200, that is, incorporating the varied spacings of the cam follower l\\'obes and \\'the different sphericities of the cam followerdobes from the sphericities of the cam surfaces 238 provided on the rotary drive member236j j Another distinguishing feature of the construction of the pump 330 over the pump 10 liesin theprovision of a drain chamber 320 which receives pressure\\'fluid from the second inlet chamber 230 which by-passes the seal 32 and discharges said by-pa ss fluid into a drain port 321 which is connected with an elongated drain channel 345 running the entire length of the housing 332 and terminating in a drain port 346. The drain chamber 3\\'20\\'serves the-same function as the drain chamber of the pump 2th and will not be discussed in detail. </p>\\n<p> fT here isshown\\' in Fig. 23 of the drawings a power unit 390 constructed in accordanc with my invention. The\\'p\\'o\\'wer unit 390 includes a primary or motor housmg 392 in which is supported a field coil 393 which encompasses an armature 394 adapted to \\'be rotated. when said field coil is energized. The motor housing 392 includes first and second end plates 396 -and-397,, respectively, the first end plate 396 being provided with a centrally located opening 398 through which the housing 11 of the above described pumps 10 or 330 is insertable\\'. The housing 1-1 of the pump 10 is shown as being disposable in the interior of the armature 394 -while it is supported from the motor housing 392 by the first end plate 14 which is secured to the first end plate 396 of the motor housing 392 by means of bolts 401 or similar fasteners. This method of mounting the pump housing 11 within the armature 394 of the motor with which it is associated is facilitated by the location of the inlet, discharge, and drain ports 35, 68, and 121, respectively, in the-first end plate -14 of the pump 10. it is obvious that by so mounting the pump 10 with-its housing 11 disposed in the interior of the armature 394, an extremely compact power unit 390-is achieved. </p>\\n<p> Located in the opposite ends of the motor housing 392 adjacent the second end plate 397 is a driving connection 403, said\\' connection including a substantially cylindrical mounting member 405 which-is secured to or formed integrally with the second end plate 397. Disposed-in the mounting member 405 and supported thereby are ball bearings 407 which are spaced from each other\\'by means of a sleeve 408. A connector 409 is secured to the interior of -the\\'armature 394 adjacent the exterior of the\\'housing 11 of the pump 10 and has a cylindrical portion 411v mounted for rotation in the bearings 407. Thus, therotationof\\'the armature 394. within the field coil 393 causes the concomitant rotation of the cylindrical portion 411 ofthe connector 409. The right-hand end of the connector 409 is provided with a female spline 412 which is adapted to receive a male spline 413 supported on the outer end of a coupling 415 which is disposed in the interior of the connector 409. The opposite end of the interior of the coupling 415 is provided with a female spline 417 which receives the splined outer end 26 of the drive shaft 25 and thus establishes a driving relationship between the armature 394 and the pump \\'10. a </p>\\n<p> The provision of the driving connection 403 on the interior of the motor housing 392 eliminates the riecessity for cumbersome and complex external driving connections between the armature 394 and the spline\\'d outer end 2601? the pump 10; As a matter of fact, the armature 394 is supported for rotation on the driving connection 403 between the armature 394 and the pump 10 and the conventional armature shaft is-eliminated, the drive shaft 25 of the pump 10\\'being aligned with the longitudinal centralaxis of the armature 394.

The prior applications and all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure in their entirety. \\n    \\n    \\n     TECHNICAL FIELD \\n     The present disclosure relates to semiconductor lasers, particularly to edge-emitting semiconductor lasers that are more stable and that can operate with lower drive power than those currently available. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     Instabilities of the output power and/or spectral characteristics of the laser source often limit the performance of optical systems used in such applications as coherent optical communications, length metrology, LIDAR, and spectroscopy-based chemical sensing. See, e.g., B. Tromborg et al., \u201cStability Analysis for a Semiconductor Laser,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  20,1023 (1984); V. Svedas, \u201cThe Significance of Lidar Pulse Stability in the IR Detection of Hazardous Compounds,\u201d  IEEE Sensors Journal  14, 1391 (2014); and L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMultiheterodyne Spectroscopy Using Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d  Opt. Engr.  57, 011014 (2018). \\n     A major source of instability is feedback from unwanted secondary optical cavities that form due to reflections from one or more surfaces encountered outside the intended primary cavity. The primary cavity of an edge-emitting diode laser is typically defined by coated or uncoated cleaved facets of the laser chip, although mirrors formed by distributed Bragg reflectors, etched facets, or other means may also be employed. While a parasitic secondary cavity may result from feedback within the chip, it is more often due to feedback from an external optic or other surface that is encountered after the beam leaves the output facet of the laser. See S. Takeda and S. Nakagawa, \u201cFeedback Tolerance of DFB Laser for Silicon Photonics Packaging,\u201d  Opt. Expr.  22, 8451 (2014). \\n     Inevitable mechanical and thermal vibrations in a laser device cause the secondary cavity length to vary, which induces temporal \u201cjitter\u201d of the magnitude and spectral characteristics of the secondary lasing modes. Such instabilities in the lasing mode and output power can, for example, seriously degrade the sensitivity of a spectroscopy-based trace chemical measurement as a result of small variations in the laser signal transmitted through a sample gas or liquid. Although an optical isolator can minimize the feedback from external optical elements, the expense, bulk, and wavelength-specificity of such isolators make them unsuitable for incorporation into an ultra-compact chemical sensing system. \\n     The cavity for a conventional narrow-ridge edge-emitting semiconductor laser is most commonly formed by cleaving two high-quality facets that define the two ends of the cavity. Typically, one of the facets (called the back facet) is coated for high reflection (HR), while the light generated within the laser is emitted from the other (front, or output) facet. The output facet may be left uncoated, in which case its reflectivity R is typically 25-40%, or it may be coated to optimize desired figures of merit. For example, the efficiency is generally maximized by applying an anti-reflection (AR) coating that reduces R to a few percent or less, whereas the threshold current density can be minimized by applying a coating with reflectivity higher than that of an uncoated facet (but which nonetheless allows some light to be transmitted to provide the laser output). Other means known to the art may also be employed to form the laser cavity, for example, by etching rather than cleaving one or both facets, or by processing distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. See, e.g., M. Ariga, et al., \u201cLow Threshold GaInAsP Lasers with Semiconductor/Air Distributed Bragg Reflector Fabricated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Etching,\u201d  Jpn. J Appl. Phys.  39, 3406 (2000). \\n     When any of those conventional configurations are employed, the stability of the laser output can be compromised by unwanted feedback from optical elements residing outside the laser cavity. In the case of emission from an end facet, for example, external optical elements may reflect light back into the cavity to provide unwanted time-variant feedback. \\n     In other cases, the laser cavity may be integrated on a chip with other optical components, and some means such as tapers and/or DBR mirrors may be employed to define the cavity, while transferring some fraction of the laser power into a waveguide for use elsewhere in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). \\n     Lasers have been integrated with other optical components to form PICs on III-V and silicon chips, as well as other substrate platforms. While a laser integrated in a PIC and emitting into a waveguide may experience little or no parasitic feedback from external optical elements, it may nonetheless may receive parasitic feedback from downstream optical elements residing elsewhere in the PIC. \\n     PICs operating at telecommunications wavelengths in the near infrared have by now become relatively mature. See C. Zhang and J. E. Bowers, \u201cSilicon photonic terabit/s network-on-chip for datacenter interconnection,\u201d  Optical Fiber Technology  44, 2 (2018)]. On the other hand, PICs operating at longer wavelengths in the extended shortwave infrared (ESWIR, defined here as \u03bb=2-3 \u03bcm), midwave infrared (MWIR, defined here as \u03bb=3-6 \u03bcm), and longwave infrared (LWIR, defined here as \u03bb=6-14 \u03bcm) spectral bands remain in the early stages of development. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,612,398 to Vurgaftman et al., entitled \u201cUltra-Broadband Photonic Integrated Circuit Platform\u201d; see also A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated 2.0 \u03bcm CW Hybrid Silicon Lasers at Room Temperature,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  40, 1480 (2015); A. Spott et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d  Optica  3, 545 (2016) (\u201cSpott,  Optica  2016\u201d); and Y. Zhang et al., \u201cThin-Film Antimonide-Based Photodetectors Integrated on Si,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  54, 4000207 (2018). Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with InAs quantum wells have recently been realized by growing the III-V gain material directly on a silicon chip. See H. Nguyen-Van et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Lasers Grown on Silicon,\u201d  Sci. Reports  8, 7206 (2018). There have been several experimental demonstrations of midwave infrared (MWIR, 2.5-6 \u03bcm) QCLs and interband cascade lasers (ICLs) integrated on silicon. See e.g., &#39;398 patent, supra; see also Spott,  Optica  2016, supra; A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated Distributed Feedback Quantum Cascade Lasers on Silicon,\u201d  Photonics  3, 35 (2016) (\u201cSpott, Photonics 2016\u201d); A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d IEEE Photonics Conference (1-5 Oct. 2017, Orlando Fla.); and A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d  Optica  5, 996 (2018). \\n     Most of these have been integrated on silicon chips, although the preliminary performance of such integrated devices has been limited in part by the challenge of bonding III-V wafer material to silicon and subsequent processing of the laser ridges from the back. Most often, the optical mode in the gain region of a silicon-based PIC is \u201chybrid,\u201d in that it is shared between the III-V gain material and an underlying silicon waveguide. See Spott,  Photonics  2016, supra. Tapers of the III-V mesa material are then introduced at the boundaries between the hybrid and silicon waveguide sections, in order to adiabatically couple the generated light from one waveguide to the other. However, the performance of these MWIR PICs has been limited in part by inefficient transfer (to date) at the tapers of laser power from the \u201chybrid\u201d III-V/silicon waveguide of the gain region to a passive silicon waveguide that is suitable for coupling the generated laser beam to other optical elements incorporated into a silicon-based PIC. \\n     At shorter wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR), such tapers have provided efficient coupling between the two waveguide sections. See, e.g., C. Zhang, \u201cLow Threshold and High Speed Short Cavity Distributed Feedback Hybrid Silicon Lasers,\u201d  Opt. Expr.  22, 10202 (2014). In those integrated lasers, most of the optical mode in the hybrid waveguide resides in the silicon portion of the waveguide rather than the III-V portion, and so gradual tapering to a silicon waveguide introduces only a relatively minor perturbation of the mode profile. \\n     However, the tapers employed in the integrated QCL and ICL demonstrations to date have induced much more reflection (and in some cases loss) than transmission of the laser beam propagating in the hybrid waveguide. This is probably due in part to the requirement for a much more abrupt evolution of the mode, which in the MWIR devices has been concentrated mostly in the III-V rather than the silicon portion of the hybrid waveguide. This mode distribution has been motivated by a concern that the gain would otherwise not be sufficient to overcome the higher waveguide loss at the longer wavelength, particularly in the case of a QCL that characteristically has relatively low material gain. \\n     A number of demonstrations of interband cascade detectors (ICDs) and quantum cascade detectors (QCDs) have been reported in recent years. These have employed absorber and injector quantum well configurations quite similar to those used in corresponding laser structures that are designed for emission near the detector cut-off wavelength in the case of an ICD, see J. V. Li et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Detectors with Room Temperature Photovoltaic Operation,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  86, 101102 (2005), or near the intersubband resonance wavelength in the case of a QCD, see F. R. Giorgetta, \u201c16.5 \u03bcm Quantum Cascade Detector Using Miniband Transport,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  90, 231111 (2007). \\n     In fact, ICDs have been processed on the same chip with ICLs, see H. Lotfi et al., \u201cMonolithically Integrated Mid-IR Interband Cascade Laser and Photodetector Operating at Room Temperature,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  109, 151111 (2016), and QCDs have been processed on the same chip with QCLs, see B. Schwarz et al., \u201cWatt-Level Continuous-Wave Emission from a Bifunctional Quantum Cascade Laser/Detector,\u201d  ACS Photonics  4, 1225 (2017), using the same multi-stage quantum well wafer material in both cases. ICDs and QCDs are capable of operating at room temperature, which is generally required for chemical sensing via evanescent coupling to a sample gas. It should be noted that neither the laser power nor the detector absorption per unit length needs to be high, since the optical beam generated by the laser can propagate a relatively long distance in the waveguide in the detector section of the chip, to allow spectroscopic detection based on attenuation by the fingerprint absorption features. However, the optical loss in the passive waveguide must be sensitive to absorption by the same gas, rather than being strongly dominated by other parasitic loss mechanisms. \\n     SUMMARY \\n     This summary is intended to introduce, in simplified form, a selection of concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Instead, it is merely presented as a brief overview of the subject matter described and claimed herein. \\n     The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission. \\n     For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors. \\n     In embodiments for which optical output from the laser cavity is required, the invention provides a means for isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF

various forms. The following description shows, by way of illustration, combinations and configurations in which the aspects and features can be put into practice. It is understood that the described aspects, features, and/or embodiments are merely examples, and that one skilled in the art may utilize other aspects, features, and/or embodiments or make structural and functional modifications without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. \\n     The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission. \\n     For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors. \\n     For embodiments in which light is output from the laser cavity, either for emission from the chip or for use elsewhere in a PIC residing on the chip, high laser stability is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n     As described in more detail below, the building blocks needed to construct an on-chip chemical sensor in accordance with the invention include (1) a highly stable laser source, (2) low-loss passive waveguides or actively pumped/amplifying sections to enable interconnections, (3) a passive sensing waveguide with evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid, and (4) an interband or quantum cascade detector. Each of these is described below. \\n     In some embodiments, the top of the waveguide in the sensing region may be coated with a chemical sorbent with a distinct absorption signature that selectively attaches a certain class of chemicals that diffuse into the sorbent from the sample gas. This can significantly enhance the absorption associated with a given concentration of molecules in the sample gas. Such a sensor on a single chip may provide spectroscopic sensing over some range of wavelengths between \u22482.5 \u03bcm and \u22486 \u03bcm when an interband cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip, or over some range of wavelengths between \u22484 \u03bcm and \u224812 \u03bcm when a quantum cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip. When III-V active gain and detector materials are bonded to a silicon chip to form the PIC, sources and detectors operating at any number of MWIR and LWIR wavelengths may in principle be combined on the same chip. \\n     The present invention provides a novel and effective means for strongly suppressing laser instabilities associated with unintended external feedback. By much more effectively isolating the laser cavity on the chip, the invention substantially reduces all interactions with external elements. Although the enhanced laser stability may sometimes be traded against a reduction of the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency, an additional benefit is the potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power required to operate the laser. For some applications these trades may be highly advantageous. \\n     In the case of a III-V PIC, attenuation of the infrared light beam propagating in the passive waveguide is quantified by an ICD or QCD fabricated from the same III-V multi-stage active quantum well structure as the ICL or QCL. Whereas a forward bias is required to produce gain and lasing, an ICD or QCD is typically operated at or near zero bias, although a reverse bias or sub-threshold forward bias may also be applied. \\n     Some embodiments of the present invention obviate the issue of inefficient coupling of the active and passive waveguides at the tapers, by replacing them with a more reliable means for coupling between different waveguide sections. In embodiments of the invention that employ a PIC on a III-V chip, no transfers between hybrid and silicon waveguides are required at all. \\n     These and other features of various embodiments of highly stable lasers and sensors integrated on the same chip are now described with reference to the FIGURES which are filed concurrently herewith and which form a part of the present disclosure. It will be noted that in the FIGURES and in the description below, elements that appear in more than one FIGURE are denoted by the same reference number, with only the first digit being changed to reflect the number of the FIGURE being described. For example, a laser cavity of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention is denoted as \u201claser cavity  101 \u201d when discussed in the context of  FIG. 1  and as \u201claser cavity  601 \u201d when discussed in the context of  FIG. 6 ; similarly, the narrow-ridge laser waveguide is denoted with reference number  103  in  FIG. 1  and with reference number  403  in  FIG. 4 . \\n     A highly stable interband or quantum cascade laser in accordance with the present invention is formed by creating a laser cavity with very weak interactions with any optical elements outside the cavity. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 1  illustrates a simplest embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 1 , such a highly stable laser includes a laser cavity  101  consisting of an ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide  103  bounded by a mirror at each end of the cavity. \\n     In this baseline configuration, the laser experiences no interactions at all with optical elements outside the laser cavity. The laser cavity illustrated in  FIG. 1  is defined by two end facets  102   a / 102   b  that are each coated with a high-reflectivity (HR) metal such as Au, with a dielectric spacer to prevent electrical shorting. In this embodiment, the two end facets are formed by cleaving the wafer from which the cavity is formed. In other embodiments, other highly reflecting end mirrors, such as etched facets with HR coatings or distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), may be employed at one or both ends of the cavity. While \u22480.5 mm represents a practical limit to the minimum cavity length that can be formed with high yield by conventional cleaving methods, shorter cavity lengths are more straightforward if a portion of the waveguide curves such that the mirrors defining both ends of the cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as discussed below, or if the cavity is defined by etching one or both facets or by processing DBRs. \\n     A highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention may be induced to lase in a single spectral mode by first requiring the laser ridge to be narrow enough to support lasing in only a single lateral mode. DBRs may then be used at one or both ends of the laser cavity to select a single longitudinal mode, while in other embodiments, the ridge may be patterned with a distributed feedback (DFB) grating. Since there is no opportunity for feedback from an external optical element to influence operation of the laser, its stability is likely to be determined primarily by the stability of the drive electronics or by thermal fluctuations from the environment (which typically take place on a relatively long time scale). Vibrations should have little effect, since all of the internal lengths are fixed and the reflectors defining the cavity should generally vibrate in unison. \\n     In some embodiments, the laser ridge may be processed on its native III-V chip using conventional fabrication methods, while in other embodiments, it may be integrated on a silicon chip by growing the III-V active gain material on silicon or by growing on the native III-V substrate and then bonding to silicon as discussed above. Processing on the native III-V chip rather than silicon is generally more straightforward and less expensive, and is likely to produce higher yield. \\n     Of course, a laser having no interaction at all with anything outside its own cavity cannot perform any useful function. However, interaction can be obtained without introducing any potential for feedback from external optical elements by evanescently coupling some or all of the laser&#39;s ridge waveguide to an ambient sample gas or liquid. \\n     In all of the embodiments of the invention described below, a common bottom contact on the substrate of the ICL or QCL wafer is employed, although embodiments with both contacts made to the top of the wafer may also employ the same inventive aspects. A substantial fraction of the optical mode resides in the top and bottom n \u2212 -GaSb separate confinement layers (SCLs), which exhibit low loss and high refractive index. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 2  illustrates a typical cross section for a conventional ICL narrow-ridge waveguide that is formed by processing ICL wafer material which is typically grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In preferred embodiments, the sidewalls of the ridge waveguide of the narrow-ridge ICL are etched to below the active stages to prevent current spreading in the wafer. \\n     The conventional narrow-ridge waveguide shown in  FIG. 2  is formed by processing ICL wafer material that includes an n + -GaSb substrate  204  with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  205  on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL)  206  on an upper surface of bottom clad  205 , active ICL gain stages  207  on an upper surface of SCL  206 , a top GaSb SCL  208  on an upper surface of the active gain stages, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad  209  on an upper surface of top SCL  208 , and a thin n + -InAs or n + -InAsSb top contact layer  210  on an upper surface of top clad  209 . A layer of a dielectric  211  such as SiN is deposited on the ridge sidewalls, followed by metallization on top of the ridge to provide a top electrical contact  212 . The bottom contact (not shown) is usually made to n + -GaSb substrate  204 . The arrows in  FIG. 2  indicate the direction of current flow when a forward bias is applied to produce gain for lasing. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 3  illustrates the cross section for an exemplary embodiment of an alternative ICL ridge waveguide that is modified such that part of the top SCL is exposed to ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , such an alternative ICL ridge waveguide, like the conventional waveguide described above with respect to  FIG. 2 , includes an n + -GaSb substrate  304  with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  305  on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL)  306  on an upper surface of bottom clad  305 , active ICL gain stages  307  on an upper surface of SCL  306 , a top GaSb SCL  308  on an upper surface of the active gain stages  307 , an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad  309  on an upper surface of top SCL  308 , and a thin n + -InAs or n + -InAsSb top contact layer  310  on an upper surface of top clad  309 . After the narrow-ridge waveguide has been etched, a dielectric layer  311  is deposited on the sidewalls to prevent electrical shorting and metal is deposited to form a top contact  312 . \\n     Unlike the conventional waveguide shown in  FIG. 2 , in the waveguide in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in  FIG. 3 , one sidewall of the active ICL stages  307 , the top SCL  308 , and top clad  309 , as well as a portion of bottom SCL  306  are exposed to permit coupling of the lasing mode to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The lasing threshold, slope efficiency, and maximum output power then provide information about whether the ambient sample gas contains any trace chemicals with absorption features at the laser wavelength. \\n     Numerous variations of this exemplary embodiment will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, in some variations, a double ridge may be formed to provide weak index guiding of the lasing mode, with the inner ridge etched to a depth above the active stages and the outer ridge etched to below the active stages. In other cases, ion bombardment can optionally be used to prevent current spreading into the outer ridge, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cWeakly Index-Guided Interband Cascade Lasers with No Grown Top Cladding Layer or a Thin Top Cladding Layer.\u201d As noted above, by depositing the dielectric and top contact metallization on only part of the ridge, the rest can remain exposed to ambient. In still other cases, a DFB grating may also be patterned into the ridge, e.g., by etching into the III-V material or by depositing Ge and patterning the grating in the Ge. See &#39;571 patent, supra. \\n     A closely analogous embodiment can be constructed using QCL gain stages for the highly stable laser rather than ICL gain stages. For the well-known case of an InP-based QCL, the substrate is InP, the active stages typically employ strain-compensated InGaAs-InAlAs quantum wells, the top and bottom cladding layers are typically n-InP, and a top and/or bottom InGaAs SCL may optionally be incorporated to maximize overlap of the optical mode with the sample gas surrounding the laser. Numerous other variations of the ridge geometry and material constituents will be obvious to one skilled in the art, and all such variations are deemed to be within the scope of the present disclosure. \\n     QCLs can operate with high performance extending from MWIR wavelengths of 4 \u03bcm or shorter to LWIR wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm, and all of the embodiments of the invention discussed below that pertain to ICLs and/or ICDs apply equally to QCLs and/or QCDs operating at both MWIR and LWIR wavelengths. \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 4A and 4B  illustrate aspects of an exemplary embodiment of a highly stable laser that provides evanescent coupling of the laser beam propagating in the cavity to a sample gas or liquid. \\n     As seen in  FIG. 4A , a highly stable laser in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention includes a laser cavity  401  that is divided longitudinally into active and passive sections  413  and  414 , respectively, where the active waveguide section includes a narrow-ridge waveguide  403 . At each end of the laser cavity is an HR-coated cleaved facet  402   a / 402   b . In other embodiments, high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to an ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. \\n       FIG. 4B  illustrates an exemplary configuration of the boundary between the active ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide section and the passive waveguide section of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. While an additional reflection will occur at the boundary between the active and passive waveguide sections, due to mismatch of the modal profiles in the two sections, generally this should not seriously degrade the spectral mode selectivity. \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 4B , such an exemplary waveguide structure includes the components previously described above with respect to  FIG. 2 , including a bottom SCL  406 , ICL (or QCL) active gain stages  407 , top SCL  408 , top clad  409 , and a thin top contact layer (not shown). The active narrow-ridge waveguide shown in  FIG. 4B  further includes a dielectric layer  411  on the sidewalls of the active narrow-ridge waveguide and a top metal contact layer  412  disposed on an upper surface of the top contact layer. At the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide is preferably HR-coated with a dielectric insulator and metal so that light which would otherwise be emitted into the ambient above the passive waveguide is reflected back into the laser cavity. \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 5A and 5B  illustrate two exemplary cross-sections of a low-loss passive waveguide section in a highly stable semiconductor laser in accordance with the present invention. These passive waveguides are formed on the same chip using the same ICL wafer material as is used for the active waveguides, with either an active or passive waveguide selected by changing the etching and other processing of a given region of the chip. \\n     As can be seen in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , in exemplary embodiments, each of these passive waveguides includes an n + -GaSb substrate  504 , an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  505 , and a bottom GaSb SCL  506 , though other materials (superlattice or bulk materials) can be used as appropriate. The ridge for each of these passive waveguides is formed by etching away the heavily-doped top contacting layer, the top cladding layer, the top SCL, and the active gain stages, with the etch stopping near the top of the bottom SCL  506 , to provide an air top clad for the waveguide. In these embodiments, the ICL waveguide may be redesigned so that the bottom SCL is thicker than the top SCL, which can be done with only a modest reduction of the optical confinement factor for the lasing mode in the ICL. In addition, in order to avoid parasitic emission into the air above the passive waveguide due to the height and modal profile differences between the active and passive waveguides at the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide should preferably be HR coated at the interface between the active and passive waveguides. \\n     In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 5A , part of the InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer  505  is also removed laterally outside the ridge, with the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stopping near the top of InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer  505 . Alternatively, in the embodiment shown in  FIG. 5B , the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stops within the bottom SCL  506 . \\n     In both cases, the air top clad of the passive waveguide in accordance with the present invention is suitable for evanescently coupling the optical mode propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. The beam propagates in the ridge waveguide formed by the bottom n \u2212 -GaSb SCL  506  as its core, the bottom superlattice cladding layer  505  (along with a portion of bottom SCL in the embodiment of  FIG. 5B ) as its bottom clad, and air as its top clad. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the sample gas or liquid. DFB gratings may be added in the active waveguide section of the cavity in a manner described below, or spectral mode selectivity may be imposed by processing DBR gratings at one or both ends of the cavity, rather than by terminating both ends of the cavity by cleaved facets with HR coatings. In either embodiment, the layer thicknesses, waveguide widths, and etch depths must be designed such that light propagating through the passive waveguide can be optically confined. In addition, in both embodiments, the tops and sides of the waveguide are suitable for evanescently coupling the propagating light to an ambient sample gas or liquid. \\n     In other cases, a structure analogous to the one shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B  can be used to construct a highly stable QCL in which the passive waveguide section is formed using a thick bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the InP lower cladding layer of the laser as the clad. \\n     Numerous variations on the waveguide geometry and material constituents for this passive waveguide will be obvious to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide sections can be made relatively long, e.g., as long as  1  cm or more, to enhance the chemical detection sensitivity, since in most cases the passive waveguide loss will be low and absorption by the sample gas weak unless the chemical species of interest is present with a high concentration. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide extending from the gain region to the end of the cavity may follow a straight path. In other embodiments, it may follow a winding path that provides the same total passive waveguide length with greater compactness on the chip. In some embodiments, the winding or curved path of the passive waveguide may terminate at a mirror provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet as the mirror at the other end of the cavity. Embodiments in which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by termination at the same HR-coated cleaved facet will be discussed further below. \\n     The spectral characteristics of the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity are modified by the presence or absence of a chemical species of interest. As a result, a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention can be incorporated into a sensor to detect the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas incident on the sensor, where the presence of the gas is detected through changes in the threshold current, slope efficiency, and/or power of the highly stable laser operating in the cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas can be detected by monitoring the compliance voltage in the I-V characteristics of the highly stable laser when a constant current is injected. See M. C. Phillips et al., \u201cIntracavity Sensing via Compliance Voltage in an External Cavity Quantum Cascade Laser,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  37, 2664 (2012). When the loss due to absorption of the laser beam by the sample gas increases, the lasing threshold increases and the radiative recombination rate decreases at a given current injection level above threshold. Therefore, a higher voltage must be applied to maintain the same current. Phillips et al., supra, observed a 0.15 V increase of the compliance voltage for a QCL emitting near 7.7 \u03bcm when the laser wavelength was swept across an absorption line of water vapor. In that experiment, the sample gas resided in an external region of the laser cavity (which also provided tuning of the laser wavelength), rather than being evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in a passive waveguide. \\n     Without an external cavity to tune the wavelength, the present invention can sweep across the absorption resonance by current or temperature tuning, where the dependence of compliance voltage on current is compared to that observed when the chemical species of interest is not present in the sample gas or liquid. In other embodiments, different lasers on the same chip can be tuned to different DFB or DBR wavelengths to provide a reference. \\n     The compliance voltage method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas may be combined with either evanescent coupling within the gain region, as in the case shown in  FIG. 1  with an active waveguide cross section such as that shown in  FIG. 3 , or when the waveguide in the laser cavity is divided into active and passive sections as shown in  FIG. 4A . \\n     For the case of an ICL, the passive waveguide could have a cross section such as that shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B . Measurement of the compliance voltage to monitor absorption by the sample gas can be applied either to ICLs or, as in the experiment reported by Phillips et al., to QCLs. \\n     A second method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas of a laser beam propagating within a highly stable laser cavity is to incorporate an additional detector waveguide section into the laser cavity. \\n     This is shown schematically in  FIG. 6 . Thus, a sensor in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 6  includes a laser cavity  601  having HR-coated end facets  602   a / 602   b , although in other embodiments high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The laser cavity contains a detector waveguide section  615  on one side of an active gain waveguide  613 , with a passive sensing waveguide  614  section on the other side of the active gain waveguide, where the top surface of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating optical mode to a sample gas or liquid as in the discussion above. In other embodiments, the detector waveguide section and the sensing waveguide section may be positioned on the same side of the active gain waveguide, rather than on opposite sides. The photocurrent measured by the detector, which may be an ICD or QCD, depends on the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity. The lasing wavelength can be tuned by varying the operating temperature, by varying the current flowing through the active gain waveguide, or by other means; in such cases, the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity will depend on the spectral characteristics of the absorption of the optical mode due to its evanescent coupling to the sample gas in the sensing waveguide section. The photocurrent measured by the detector will then provide information about the spectral characteristics of the absorption by the sample gas. \\n     In other embodiments, the detector may also be placed inside the laser cavity when evanescent coupling to the sample gas occurs within the active gain section, as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 3 . In such cases, the laser cavity includes an active gain waveguide section and a detector waveguide section, but no separate passive waveguide section. The active gain waveguide section and detector waveguide section must be separately contacted, with a gap in between to prevent crosstalk between the two sections. In some embodiments, a DBR may be positioned between the gain and detector sections of the waveguide to reduce the loss of the laser cavity. The DBR can cause the laser to operate in a single spectral mode, preferably with the detector waveguide extending beyond its absorption length before another reflecting element is encountered. Alternatively, if a second DBR is placed at the other end of the detector waveguide, the detector can be made to function as a resonant cavity IR detector (RCID) with the same resonance wavelength as the laser. See U.S. Pat. No. 10,297,699 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cIn-Plane Resonant-Cavity Infrared Photodetectors with Fully-Depleted Absorbers.\u201d The opposite end of the laser cavity can be defined by an additional DBR, or by a broadband HR mirror such as a coated cleaved facet. \\n     As noted above, both ICLs and QCLs may be operated as detectors if zero bias, a reverse bias, or a sub-threshold forward bias is applied rather than the above-threshold forward bias needed to produce lasing, with the resulting photocurrent being monitored to quantify the strength of the propagating optical signal. See Li et al., supra, and Giorgetta et al. (2007), supra. \\n     In the example of an ICL operated under forward bias to produce gain, the electron injector with chirped quantum well thicknesses transfers electrons from the semimetallic interface to the active electron quantum wells, where they recombine with holes in the active hole quantum well. In an ICD, however, electrons that are photoexcited in the active quantum wells of a given stage flow \u201cdownhill\u201d through the electron injector toward the semimetallic interface, where they recombine with photoexcited holes from the next stage. Thus, whereas a single electron injected electrically into an N-stage ICL can produce N photons, an ICD requires N photons to transfer a single electron across all the stages to provide photocurrent. The cut-off wavelength of the ICD is roughly equal to the emission wavelength of the ICL, since both are determined by the bandgap of the active quantum wells and that bandgap does not change substantially with the application of a forward or reverse bias. Whereas the photocurrent must compete with the noise induced by thermally-generated electrons that traverse the same path, a very high detectivity is not required because the detector residing inside the laser cavity experiences a high photon flux. \\n     However, the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity must be short enough that loss associated with absorption of the lasing photons does not seriously degrade the laser performance. To minimize the loss, it may be advantageous to apply a sub-threshold forward bias to the detector waveguide section of the cavity, which will lower the loss in the cavity while still allowing photocurrent to be generated. The advantage of lower loss must be weighed against the disadvantage that the detector noise current will be higher when a sub-threshold forward bias is applied. It may, in fact, be beneficial to monitor the detector response as a function of sub-threshold bias current. \\n     The operation of a quantum cascade detector is quite similar, except that intersubband absorption then provides photocurrent across the active stages when a reverse, zero, or sub-threshold forward bias is applied to the structure. In the case of a QCD, the maximum absorption in the detector waveguide section occurs at a wavelength that is noticeably longer than the same structure&#39;s QCL emission wavelength, since before absorption the electrons in thermal equilibrium or quasi-thermal equilibrium reside primarily in a subband that is about two optical phonon energies lower than the subband corresponding to the lower lasing level. The role of the lower subband is to ensure rapid depopulation of the lower lasing level following stimulated emission. In spite of this mismatch, the higher subband that contributes to absorption at the emission wavelength is sufficiently populated at room temperature for the absorption coefficient to reach several cm \u22121 , according to simulations by the inventors. In many cases this will be sufficient to allow the light intensity propagating in the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity to be monitored. \\n     The spectral dependence of the highly stable laser intensity in the presence of evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid can be determined by tuning the laser wavelength with current or temperature, by using a sampled grating to increase the tuning range, see S. Kim, \u201cDesign and Analysis of Widely Tunable Sampled Grating DFB Laser Diode Integrated With Sampled Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector,\u201d  IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett.  16, 15 (2004), or by placing multiple lasers with slightly different operating wavelengths (e.g., tuned by varying the DFB or DBR grating pitch) on the same chip. \\n     The emitter areas of a sensing chip employing any of these embodiments will be suitable for gold electro-plating above the contact metallization, to enhance the thermal dissipation for better laser and detector performance. In the case of intra-cavity evanescent coupling to the sample gas via an exposed sidewall of the laser ridge, as illustrated in  FIG. 3 , epitaxial-side-down mounting for further enhancement of the thermal dissipation will be possible only if the processing provides an air pocket that allows the sample gas access to the exposed sidewall of the ridge. Since it may be quite challenging to incorporate such an air pocket, it will be more straightforward to apply epitaxial-side-down mounting to the emitter areas of embodiments that provide evanescent coupling to the sample gas via a passive waveguide section of the laser cavity, as in the embodiments shown in  FIGS. 4 and 6 . \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 7A and 7B  illustrate an exemplary embodiment in which this is accomplished by flip-chip bonding the active gain region of the laser cavity to a heat sink, while leaving the passive sensing waveguide section hanging over the edge of the heat sink to provide access to the sample gas. Thus,  FIG. 7A  shows a single chip  716  containing multiple highly stable laser cavities  701   a / 701   b , etc, each comprising active gain waveguide and passive sensing waveguide sections  713  and  714 , where the chip can be mounted epitaxial-side-down on a patterned heat sink submount  717 . After epitaxial-side-down mounting on the patterned submount, as illustrated in  FIG. 7B , the passive sensing waveguide sections of all the laser cavities extend over the edge of the submount to provide exposure of the passive sensing waveguide sections to the ambient sample gas. \\n       FIGS. 7A and 7B  also illustrate that the active gain waveguide sections of multiple lasers on the same chip can be epitaxial-side-down mounted in this manner, as long as they are all at the same end of the chip and the passive sensing waveguide sections at the other end of the chip can all be exposed over the edge of the mount. It may be more straightforward to mount multiple lasers on the chip epitaxial side down, while another portion of the chip hangs over the edge of the thermal mount to allow access to an ambient sample gas, when both ends of all the laser cavities terminate at the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as will be discussed below. \\n     In some embodiments of the invention, output from the highly-stable laser is coupled into a passive waveguide, e.g., such as that shown in  FIG. 5  for the case of an ICL PIC, for chemical sensing or some other functionality elsewhere on the PIC. In some of these embodiments, the mirror at one or both ends of the highly-stable laser cavity is formed by butt-coupling the active and passive waveguides as shown in  FIG. 4B . Due to the mismatch of the modal refractive index at the interface between the two waveguide sections, part of the beam is reflected back into the laser cavity to provide feedback. \\n     As discussed above, a dominant contribution to the instability of semiconductor lasers is often unwanted feedback from external optical elements. This effect can be especially strong in the case of a conventional edge-emitting configuration in which the output facet of the cleaved cavity is either AR coated (reflectivity R\u22642%) or uncoated (typically R\u224825-40%). In both cases, a significant fraction of the light that is returned to the facet following reflection by an external element is transmitted back into the cavity. Therefore, suppressing the feedback from external elements can lead to a substantial enhancement of the laser stability. \\n     One approach to reducing the external feedback is to increase the reflectivity of the output facet to as high as about 90%. In applying this approach as well as the other embodiments discussed below, there is a trade-off between degraded stability when the reflectivity is low against lower maximum output power and efficiency when it is high. A further consideration is that the internal laser operation is more efficient when the mirrors at both ends of the cavity have high reflectivity. The cavity can then be shortened without causing excessive mirror loss, which provides a potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power. The most straightforward approach to increasing the reflectivity at a facet while still allowing output is to deposit a multi-layer Bragg dielectric coating. However, such coatings can be expensive and challenging to apply, especially at longer wavelengths where each layer becomes proportionally thicker. \\n     An alternative approach to increasing the reflectivity of an output mirror is to use a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror rather than a cleaved facet to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 8A  illustrates an exemplary first- or third-order DBR mirror  819  that defines one end of a highly stable ICL cavity having the layer structure described above with respect to  FIG. 2 . \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 8A , the etch for the DBR preferably stops just above the active ICL gain stages  807 , which means that current spreading into those stages can minimize loss in the DBR section of the waveguide that does not have a top contact to provide current injection. Whereas the current injected into a conventional diode laser spreads a few microns at most, it is known that the current injected into an ICL or QCL typically spreads laterally by &gt;100 \u03bcm. See Forouhar et al., \u201cReliable Mid-Infrared Laterally-Coupled Distributed-Feedback Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  105, 051110 (2014); see also U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571, supra. Due to limitations of the practical etch depth and sidewall angle that can be achieved routinely for a given grating period when GaSb-based laser structures are processed with reactive ion etching, the processing yield is likely to be higher if a third-order grating is employed rather than a first-order grating. For the case of an exemplary ICL emitting at 3.5 \u03bcm, the grating period is then roughly 1.5 \u03bcm, and it is preferable that the grating comprise &gt;100 periods if high reflectivity is desired. An analogous DBR mirror can similarly be patterned into QCL structures. In the case of a InP- or GaAs-based QCL emitting at a wavelength beyond 4 \u03bcm, it may be practical to employ a first-order rather than third-order grating, since those material systems are less challenging to etch with steep sidewall angles, and the period also scales wavelength. \\n     The reflectivity of the DBR mirror can be tuned to a desired value by varying the grating length (number of periods) or the etch depth, to produce the desired trade-off between laser stability and laser power. For maximum reflection by a mirror that is not intended for output, a simulation by the inventors of the ICL structure shown in  FIG. 8A  indicates that a grating length of at least 100 \u03bcm is preferred, which with an etch depth of 1.1 \u03bcm is projected to produce a reflectivity of \u224890%. Whereas a longer grating would provide higher reflectivity, there is a limit to how far current injected from the top metal contact will spread into the DBR. Any unpumped outer portion of the DBR that does not receive very much current will be lossy, although this loss will be mitigated somewhat by self-pumping from the laser light reaching those portions of the DBR. Any loss that results will limit the maximum attainable mirror reflectivity. In some embodiments, the etched notches between the DBR teeth can be filled with a dielectric such as SiN, with a metal contact applied to the top of the DBR teeth so that current can be injected into the active stages of the DBR section of the waveguide to minimize the loss. In other embodiments, a dielectric such as SiN can be deposited over the entire top of the DBR, so that metal can be deposited on top of the dielectric for epitaxial-side-down mounting. In any embodiment for which a dielectric fills the notches in the DBR, the grating pitch must naturally be adjusted so as to account for the altered modal refractive index in the DBR section of the waveguide. \\n     When a DBR is used as the output mirror, its reflectivity can be adjusted for optimal trade-off between laser stability and maximum laser power, as discussed above. The beam from an ICL that includes such a DBR can be output to a passive waveguide section that begins just beyond the final DBR period. This passive waveguide can then be directed elsewhere on the chip for use in a PIC, or to an output facet for emission from the chip. In the latter case, feedback from the chip&#39;s output facet should be minimized by depositing an AR coating, and possibly also tilting the passive waveguide with respect to the output facet. When the III-V laser is integrated on a silicon PIC platform, it is relatively straightforward to provide a DBR by pre-patterning it into the silicon before the active III-V gain material is bonded and processed. See Spott,  Photonics  2016, supra. \\n     In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 8B , the DBR is formed in a passive waveguide structure such as that illustrated in  FIG. 5 , rather than in the full active waveguide as shown in  FIG. 8A . The grating is then etched into the passive waveguide to a depth stopping within the bottom SCL layer  806  or the bottom cladding layer  805 . While there will be a greater mismatch of the mode in the laser&#39;s narrow ridge waveguide  803  and that in the passive waveguide of the DBR  819 , an advantage for some configurations is a lower loss due to removal of the active quantum wells. This may be more important in the case of an ICL rather than QCL PIC, since in the absence of a forward bias the active quantum wells in an ICL display higher optical loss. \\n     In other embodiments of the invention, feedback from optical elements external to the laser cavity (residing either external to the chip or elsewhere on the chip if the laser is integrated into a PIC) is reduced to enhance the laser stability by extracting light via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide that runs parallel to the primary active gain waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, rather than the conventional extraction of light at a partially-transmissive end mirror (or alternatively, by using a second-order diffraction grating to emit light out of the plane). \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 9  shows a cross-section of one embodiment for the two parallel waveguides at the HR-coated facet. As illustrated in  FIG. 9 , active gain waveguide  903  includes a bottom SCL section  906   a , an insulating film section  911   a  and top SCL section  908 , and further includes active ICL stages  907 , top clad  909 , and a top n +  contact layer (not shown), whereas passive waveguide  914  includes only a bottom SCL section  906   b  and dielectric insulating layer  911   b  on the top and sides without a top clad or active gain stages because those were etched away from the passive waveguide during the processing. Both the active and passive waveguides are coated with a top metal contact layer  912 . The preferred separation between the two waveguides is \u2248300 nm to \u22482 \u03bcm, and the space between them is filled with a layer  911   b  of a dielectric that has low loss at the emission wavelength, such as SiN in the case of the ICLs. The etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 9  and in  FIG. 5A , or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . The entire top of this section of the passive waveguide is covered by the insulating dielectric  911   b  to minimize loss due to overlap of the optical mode with the top metal  912  that is deposited to provide a top contact and to enhance the extraction of heat from the active laser ridge. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 10  illustrates another embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 10 , light from a laser cavity  1001  is extracted from the highly stable laser via evanescent coupling of the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1003  to a second (passive) waveguide  1014  that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1003  over some portion of the laser cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, the light coupled into the passive waveguide propagates to a third facet  1002   c , which is cleaved orthogonally to the two facets that define opposite ends of the laser cavity, with the light emitted from the chip via the third facet. \\n     Once a desired fraction of the beam has been coupled into the passive waveguide  1014 , it angles away from primary active waveguide  1003  and is directed either toward a facet  1002   c  for emission from the chip as output  1021  (as shown in the FIGURE), or elsewhere on the chip for functionality within a PIC (not shown). In the former case, the facet at which light is emitted may be AR coated, and/or the passive waveguide may intersect the facet at a sufficiently large angle with respect to normal, as shown in the figure, that reflection at the emission facet is minimized. Reflection at the emission facet  1002   c  would reduce the output power, and also couple reflected light back into the laser cavity  1001 . \\n     To provide single-mode operation of the highly stable laser, in some embodiments, a DFB grating may be fabricated in the active waveguide of the laser cavity, while in other embodiments, the cavity may be bounded by high-reflectivity DBRs rather than HR-coated facets. \\n     In still other embodiments, the highly stable laser may also be configured as an interband cascade laser (ICL) frequency comb. See Bagheri et al., \u201cPassively mode-locked interband cascade optical frequency combs,\u201d  Sci. Reports  8, 3322 (2018), which was co-authored by some of the inventors of the present invention. In such embodiments, the laser cavity is divided into two separately-contacted sections, where one section provides gain while the other serves as a saturable absorber (SA). The SA section may be ion bombarded to shorten the carrier lifetime for faster recovery of the absorption condition, and a reverse bias may also be applied to further shorten the lifetime. That configuration can provide passive mode locking, with emission in a pulse length shorter than  1  picosecond. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 11  illustrates an alternative embodiment of a highly stable laser in which light is extracted via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide  1114  that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1103  over some section of the laser cavity. In this embodiment, the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet. Apart from the paths followed, the geometries of the active and passive waveguides may be the same as for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 10 . In embodiments for which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as in  FIG. 11 , the bending radius should preferably be large enough that bending loss remains a small fraction of the net waveguide loss. Again, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL. \\n     The active waveguide that forms the cavity of the highly stable laser may be straight, and connect two HR-coated cleaved facets, as shown in  FIG. 10 , or it may be curved such that both end mirrors are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as shown in  FIG. 11 . In both cases, gold electroplating may be applied to the active waveguide to improve heat dissipation, which optionally may be followed by epitaxial-side-down mounting to a substrate or other mount. In addition, in both cases, the output beam propagating in the passive waveguide can be directed to a facet for emission from the chip as output  1021 / 1121 , as shown in the FIGURES, or it may be directed to some other region of a PIC for on-chip chemical sensing or some other function. Although  FIGS. 10 and 11  show the output waveguide that evanescently couples to the primary waveguide of the laser cavity to be a passive waveguide, in other cases, the output waveguide may be an active waveguide that maintains the active gain stages, top SCL, top clad, and top contact layer. \\n     In the case of a highly stable QCL, the loss in the full gain region without a bias is relatively low, so the passive waveguide may optionally comprise the entire QCL structure with the same processing, ridge width, and etch depth(s) used to form the narrow ridge of the passive waveguide as was used to form the narrow ridge of the active waveguide, except that no dielectric is needed on the sidewalls, no metal is deposited on top for contacting, and no bias is applied. The loss in the passive QCL waveguide may be reduced further by ion bombardment. See U.S. Pat. No. 9,450,053 to Anish Goyal et al., entitled \u201cPhotonic Integrated Circuits Based On Quantum Cascade Structures.\u201d However, in the case of a highly stable ICL, the loss in the output waveguide will be quite high if the entire ICL gain structure is retained. Therefore, the active stages should be etched away as discussed above to form a low-loss passive waveguide such as those shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B , or the entire ICL structure should be retained, including a top contact which provides a forward bias at a level high enough to reduce the loss to an acceptable level. Alternatively, an output waveguide comprising the full QCL or ICL structure can be contacted and biased above threshold to provide further amplification of the laser signal. \\n     The strength of coupling between the primary and secondary waveguides may be tuned by varying the separation distance between the two waveguides, the depth of the etch in the region separating them, and/or the length over which they run in parallel. A broad range of net coupling strengths can be induced by varying one or more of these design parameters. The net coupling strength will govern the trade-off between laser stability (maximized when the coupling is weak) and maximum output power and efficiency (maximized when the coupling is strong). The maximum coupling is obtained when the region separating the active and passive waveguides is not etched at all. The inventors have simulated the coupling between active and passive waveguides, similar to those illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 5A , respectively, corresponding to a typical design for an ICL emitting at a wavelength around 3.5 \u03bcm. If both waveguides are 5 \u03bcm wide and separated by 500 nm, with no etch of the region separating them, the simulation predicts that a maximum of \u224827% of the light can be transferred from the active to the passive waveguide, which occurs over a coupling length of \u224819 \u03bcm along the longitudinal axis. \\n     In other embodiments, a highly stable laser may generate gain in a hybrid III-V/silicon waveguide processed on a silicon platform. \\n     The block schematic in  FIGS. 12A-12C  illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a coupling approach that is projected to transfer the beam more efficiently while maintaining highly stable laser operation. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 12 , QCL or ICL gain material is heterogeneously bonded to a pre-processed silicon platform to form a laser cavity with a hybrid narrow-ridge waveguide. See Spott,  Optica  2016, supra. Preferably, both ends of the laser cavity are bounded by high-reflectivity mirrors. In some embodiments, one or both high-reflectivity mirrors may be an HR-coated facet. In other embodiments, such as that shown in  FIG. 12 , the III-V ridge extends beyond both ends of the laser cavity, which is bounded and defined by two DBR mirrors  1222   a  and  1222   b  which are patterned into the silicon before the III-V gain material is bonded thereto, where the DBR mirrors preferably induce nearly 100% reflectivity in the laser cavity. \\n     The lasing mode resides primarily in a first III-V/silicon hybrid waveguide  1223   a , whose silicon portion is a narrow ridge that was pre-patterned in the silicon platform before the two materials were heterogeneously bonded. Following the heterogeneous bonding, the narrow silicon ridge lies underneath the III-V ridge. It is narrower than the III-V ridge, and extends along the entire laser cavity (and beyond) along a straight path. In addition, a second pre-processed silicon waveguide  1223   b , which is also narrower than the III-V ridge is laterally separated from the first narrow silicon ridge by some distance and runs parallel to the first silicon waveguide  1223   a  along some portion of the laser cavity, but at some point begins to follow an angular trajectory that finally exits the III-V mesa and the laser cavity. The second silicon waveguide  1223   b  extends well beyond the DBR mirror  1222   a  at a first end of the gain cavity to provide loss outside the gain cavity without inducing any parasitic reflections that can feed light back into the laser cavity. Once it has completely emerged from the III-V mesa, the second silicon waveguide  1223   b  is a passive waveguide that provides the output of light from the integrated QCL or ICL in the form of a passive waveguide  1214 . The output light can either be emitted from the chip, or directed elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a PIC. \\n     This structure also avoids many of the processing challenges that occur when tapers are introduced to transfer the mode between active and passive waveguides, as well as optical losses that can occur at the tapers. Furthermore, highly reflecting DBRs are straightforward to pattern in the silicon waveguide before the III-V gain material is bonded. \\n     As in some of the embodiments discussed previously, there will be a trade-off between higher laser stability when the coupling to the emission silicon waveguide is weak, and higher power transferred to that waveguide when it is stronger. The coupling strength of the emission silicon waveguide to the lasing mode can be controlled by how close its straight portion (to the left in  FIG. 12A ) is to the center of the optical mode profile that nominally corresponds to the middle of the III-V active mesa, as well by the length of the straight section. This straight portion precedes its angular section that leads to its departure from the laser cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, silicon waveguide  1223   a  may be eliminated, with the optical mode at the end of the cavity that does not include the second silicon waveguide  1223   b  (to the right in  FIG. 12A ) residing almost entirely in the active III-V gain material which is bounded below by air (or a dielectric). Note that this and related embodiments may provide efficient out-coupling for both QCLs and ICLs that are heterogeneously integrated with silicon. \\n     In some embodiments of the invention, an on-chip chemical sensor is formed by coupling the highly stable laser to a sensing region that is not incorporated within the laser cavity as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 4 and 6 . \\n     In the subset of embodiments illustrated in  FIG. 13A , a portion of the lasing mode is evanescently coupled into a passive waveguide  1314  as discussed above with respect to  FIG. 10 . Some section of the passive waveguide  1314  has an air top cladding, as in the configurations illustrated in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , so as to provide evanescent coupling to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The other end of the passive waveguide then couples to a detector waveguide section  1315  that also resides on the chip. The detector may be processed to have the same narrow ridge active waveguide or a similar active waveguide to the narrow ridge waveguide used in the highly-stable laser cavity. As discussed above and as shown in  FIG. 13B , the detector waveguide may optionally be bounded by DBRs that cause it to function as an RCID with increased sensitivity within the linewidth of the spectral resonance. Like the narrow ridge waveguide in the laser cavity, the detector waveguide has a top electrical contact that is used to detect a photocurrent due to light propagating in the detector waveguide when it is operated at zero bias, under a reverse bias, or under a forward bias below that required to reach the lasing threshold. \\n     In the case of a III-V PIC, an interband cascade detector (ICD) or quantum cascade detector (QCD) may be formed from the same active structure as the ICL or QCL source, as illustrated schematically in  FIG. 13A  and as discussed above regarding the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 6 . Alternatively, if the PIC resides on a silicon substrate, the III-V laser and detector structures bonded to the silicon chip may be the same or different. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 13A  illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a sensor in which a highly stable laser  1301  in accordance with the present invention, an extended passive sensing waveguide  1314 , and an ICD/QCD  1315  all reside on the same III-V chip. In III-V PIC embodiments such as that illustrated in  FIG. 13A , the passive waveguide  1314  that provides sensing may be extended to whatever length optimizes the sensitivity of the response of the ICD/QCD  1315  to the presence of the sample gas or liquid impinging on the sensor. The path followed by the waveguide in the sensing region can be straight or, as illustrated in the FIGURE, can be circuitous, so long as the path&#39;s minimum curvature does not induce an excessive bending loss.  FIG. 13  B illustrates that in some embodiments, the ICD or QCD  1315  is an in-plane resonant cavity detector that is bounded on both sides by Bragg mirrors  1319  (Meyer et al. &#39;699 patent, supra). \\n     In other embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 14 , the passive sensing waveguide may take the form of one or more ring resonators  1424  evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity  1401 . \\n     In such embodiments, the highly stable laser beam propagating in the laser cavity couples evanescently to a ring resonator  1424  formed by a passive waveguide whose top and/or sides are exposed to the ambient sample gas or liquid. The intensity of the light propagating in the ring is quantified by evanescently coupling the ring resonator to a waveguide  1414  that leads to a detector  1415  that absorbs the emission wavelength of the laser and resonance wavelength of the ring. As described above, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide with respect to the active waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 5A  or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . Naturally, the highly stable laser  1401  must emit at least some light at the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator, and the detector  1415  must be sensitive to light that is incident at that wavelength. \\n     Evanescent coupling of the laser to the ring resonator(s) may be realized by placing one section of the ring waveguide in close proximity to the laser waveguide, or by shaping the ring as a racetrack that evanescently couples to the laser cavity over an extended length. The ring resonator  1424  may have any closed-loop shape that assures low bending loss and a high quality factor Q. Coupling to the ring resonator or to a coupled mode of two ring resonators of slightly different sizes may induce the laser to operate in a single-spectral mode, without requiring the formation of a DFB grating or DBR mirrors. Some of the present inventors previously evanescently coupled ICLs to ring resonators, which was shown to induce laser emission in a single spectral mode. See W. W. Bewley et al., \u201cSingle-Mode Interband Cascade Lasers with Coupled Ring Resonators,\u201d  Conference on Lasers and Electro - Optics  (2011). \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 14 , the ring also evanescently couples to a passive waveguide  1414  that leads to a detector  1415  that interrogates the intensity of the optical beam output from the ring resonator. Therefore, measuring the photocurrent flowing in the detector while the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator is varied by temperature tuning or some other means can provide information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas or liquid. Furthermore, multiple ring resonators with different resonance wavelengths, along with detectors associated with each ring resonator, can provide information over a broader spectral range. If the sample gas contains a chemical species that absorbs light at the ring&#39;s resonance wavelength, the output from the ring is reduced by an amount related to the concentration of the absorbing gas species. The net absorption by the gas is enhanced significantly by the many round-trip passes through the high-Q ring cavity. The resonance wavelength of the ring may be tuned to coincide with an absorption feature of a given chemical species by varying the temperature of the sensing area, which in some embodiments may be controlled separately from the temperatures of the source and detector. If no chemical species in the sample gas absorbs at a resonance wavelength within the range that is scanned when the temperature is varied, the detected signal should not vary appreciably with resonance wavelength. \\n     In both of the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 13 and 14 , a passive connecting waveguide, which for an ICL PIC consists only of the core and cladding layers as illustrated in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B , butt-couples directly to the detector waveguide that contains the full ICD or QCD structure. \\n     If the platform is a III-V PIC, the detector is an ICD or QCD formed from the same wafer material as the laser. In other embodiments, the platform may be formed from a different III-V material if multiple III-V active components are bonded to a common silicon PIC platform for coupling to silicon passive waveguides that form the ring resonator and passive connecting waveguides. Again, the detector may employ an unpatterned active waveguide, or function as an RCID for higher sensitivity if both boundaries of the absorber are bounded by DBRs as in  FIG. 13B . \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 15A  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the optical mode propagating in a passive waveguide  1514  evanescently couples to an adjacent detector waveguide  1515 , which is also shown in greater detail in  FIG. 15B . The geometry of the two waveguides is entirely analogous to the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 9 and 10 , which evanescently couples light propagating in the primary waveguide of a laser cavity to the secondary passive waveguide. In the case of evanescent coupling of the passive waveguide to a detector, the coupling strength should be maximized to the extent possible. With sufficient parallel coupling pathlength, nearly half the light can be transferred to the detector waveguide. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide that runs parallel to the detector waveguide may be bounded by DBRs that maximize the coupling strength for light at the resonant wavelength. \\n     To use the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 13-15  for on-chip spectroscopic sensing, the laser drive current and/or the temperature of the chip or some portion of the chip may be varied so as to tune the laser wavelength and/or ring resonance wavelength across a narrow fingerprint absorption feature of a given chemical species that may be present in the sample gas. To probe the optical absorption by the sample gas over a broader range of wavelengths, the highly stable laser may be configured as a sampled grating laser whose emission wavelength can be tuned over the entire spectral bandwidth of the gain material. See Kim et al., supra. A given thermal shift of the refractive index of the gain and/or ring resonator material then induces a larger tuning range than can be obtained by tuning a single optical mode. \\n     In other embodiments, current may be injected into the emitter waveguide at a level below the lasing threshold, so that it functions as a light emitting device (LED) or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) device with emission extending over a broader spectral band (much broader in the case of the LED). In those embodiments, a ring resonator waveguide that evanescently couples to the sample gas, and/or the resonance wavelength of an RCID formed by placing DBRs at each end of the detector&#39;s absorber waveguide, may filter the broadband output of the emitter to allow the spectral dependence of absorption by the sample gas to be determined on a much finer wavelength scale. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 16A  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which a single LED, ASE, or tunable ICL or QCL source  1625  emits into a passive bus waveguide  1614 , and then a series of single or coupled ring resonators  1624   a/b/c/d . . . n,  each of which is tuned to a different resonance wavelength, evanescently couples to the same passive bus waveguide. The passive waveguides used for the bus, ring resonators, and connectors leading to the detectors may be formed from the lower SCL of the laser structure as shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5B . \\n     Each ring in the series selectively extracts its own resonance wavelength from the bus to allow the spectral dependence of the absorption to be determined. Each ring also couples into a passive waveguide  1614   /a/b/  . . . , which in turn couples into to a corresponding ICD or QCD  1615   a/b/c/d . . . n,  whose absorber waveguide section may optionally be bound at both ends by DBRs to form an RCID. This is analogous to an embodiment described by the inventors of the present invention in U.S. Pat. No. 10,333,011 supra except that the &#39;011 patent described an on-chip chemical sensor residing on a silicon platform, with silicon-based passive bus, ring resonator, and connecting waveguides, whereas the on-chip sensor illustrated in  FIG. 16  instead incorporates the entire chemical sensing system on a III-V PIC chip. \\n     In other embodiments of the invention, multiple on-chip sensors, each operating at a different resonance wavelength, are integrated onto the same III-V PIC. The block schematic in  FIG. 17  illustrates an embodiment in which each in a series of ring resonators  1724   a/b/c . . .  (or ring resonator pairs) evanescently couples to its own corresponding highly stable laser or broadband optical source with corresponding narrow-ridge waveguides  1703   a/b/c  . . . , in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor described above with respect to  FIG. 14 . Each ring resonator is exposed to the sample gas and couples to an ICD or QCD  1715   a/b/c  . . . that measures the beam intensity at the resonance wavelength of the given sensing element. Although three sensing elements operating at three different resonance wavelengths \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , and \u03bb 3  are shown in  FIG. 17 , any number sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 18  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which multiple extended passive sensing waveguides  1814   a/b/c  reside on the same chip in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor embodiment described above with respect to  FIG. 13 . In this embodiment, emission from each of an array of highly stable laser cavities  1801   a/b/c  (or broadband LEDs or ASE sources) is input into a corresponding extended passive waveguide  1814   a/b/c,  etc., where the passive waveguides have air top claddings that allow evanescent coupling to the sample gas. Corresponding ICDs or QCDs  1815   a/b/c  that are coupled to each extended passive sensing waveguide  1814   a/b/c  measure the signal traversing the full length of each such passive waveguide, with each sensing element operating independently of the others. Again, although three independent sensing elements operating at three different wavelengths are illustrated in  FIG. 18 , any number of sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip. \\n     In this case, spectroscopic information is obtained by varying the DFB or DBR grating period to tune each individual single-spectral-mode laser  1801   a/b/c  to a different emission wavelength, or by employing broadband sources and varying the resonance wavelength of an RCID  1815 / a/b/c  that measures the intensity of the optical beam transmitted by the extended passive sensing waveguide. When multiple sensors operating at different resonance wavelengths are employed on the same chip, the different sensors can be tuned to wavelengths on and off the spectral fingerprint features of a given chemical, to several representative wavelengths that provide additional spectral details, or to use the same chip for detecting multiple chemical species. Fine-tuning of the sensing element resonance wavelengths can be implemented by locally or globally controlling the temperature on the chip, or by varying the current injected into each given laser source. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 19  illustrates that in some embodiments, the top of the passive waveguide in the sensing region can be coated by a chemical sorbent  1926  which can adsorb the molecules of certain classes of chemicals, thereby placing them in the immediate vicinity of the propagating light beam and enhancing their molecular concentration by orders of magnitude. See, e.g., T. H. Stievater et al., \u201cMicromechanical Photothermal Spectroscopy of Trace Gases Using Functionalized Polymers,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  37, 2328 (2012). \\n     Thus, as shown in  FIG. 19 , the passive waveguide in such a case can include a GaSb substrate  1904 , a n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad layer  1905 , and a bottom GaSb SCL  1906 . Sorbent layer  1926  covers all of the SCL  1906  and the upper surface of the bottom clad layer  1905 , with the thickness of the sorbent coating preferably matching the vertical extent of the optical mode propagating in the passive waveguide. As in the other cases described herein, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 19  and in  FIG. 5A  or it may proceed only partway through the bottom SCL, as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . In addition, although  FIG. 19  illustrates a case where the chemical sorbent is deposited on a passive waveguide processed on an ICL chip, in other embodiments the sorbent may be deposited on the passive waveguides on a QCL PIC chip, or on passive silicon waveguides. \\n     As noted above, the cavity of a highly stable ICL may be configured with gain and saturable absorber sections so that it is passively mode locked and produces short pulses that appear as a frequency comb in the spectral domain, as was recently demonstrated in Bagheri et al. supra. Since the comb stability is often a primary factor limiting the detection sensitivity of dual-comb spectroscopy, it will be advantageous to exploit the greater stability provided by the architectural embodiments of the present invention. \\n     Thus, in some embodiments, both end mirrors of the highly stable frequency comb ICL are defined by HR-coated cleaved facets, and the laser output is obtained via evanescent coupling to a secondary passive waveguide. This is directly analogous to the configurations illustrated in  FIGS. 9 , - 11 , and  15  for highly stable lasers that are not frequency combs, except that the cavity for the frequency comb laser is divided into gain and saturable absorber sections. As in the case of a highly stable non-frequency-comb laser, the laser cavity in a highly stable frequency-comb laser (ICL or QCL) can also be defined by an etched facet or a DBR mirror at one or both ends of the cavity. The output of such a highly stable frequency comb laser can be emitted from the chip, as illustrated in  FIGS. 10 and 11 , or it may be directed via the passive waveguide to some other region of the chip for functionality in a PIC as in  FIGS. 13 and 15 . For example, one or more highly stable frequency comb ICL(s) may be used as the source(s) for an on-chip chemical sensing system. \\n     In particular, two highly stable frequency combs may be employed on the same chip as sources for fully integrated on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy. See, e.g., L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMid-Infrared Dual-Comb Spectroscopy with Low Drive-Power On-Chip Sources,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  44, 2113 (2019). Dual-comb spectroscopy is known to offer high spectral resolution over a broad spectral bandwidth, combined with a very short acquisition time on the order of milliseconds. See, e.g., G. Villares et al., \u201cDual-Comb Spectroscopy Based on Quantum-Cascade-Laser Frequency Combs,\u201d  Nature Commun.  5, 6192 (2014). In dual-comb spectroscopy, information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas is obtained by using a fast detector to observe the multi-heterodyne beating of two frequency combs that have slightly different comb spacings (determined by the cavity length), so as to generate a direct link between the optical and RF domains. The beam from one of the combs interrogates the sample gas, whereas the other comb functions as a local oscillator whose beam does not come into contact with the sample gas. Both transmitted beams then coupled into the same on-chip ICD or QCD, whose output is input to an RF spectrum analyzer. Since a fast detector is required for rapid sensing measurement speed, it is advantageous that both ICDs and QCDs have displayed 3-dB bandwidths of up to 1 GHz and above. See H. Lotfi et al., \u201cHigh-Frequency Operation of a Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade System at Room Temperature,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  108, 201101 (2016); and F. R. Giorgetta et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Detectors,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  1039 (2009). \\n     For the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , the laser cavity  2001   a/b  of each comb is formed from a straight waveguide divided into a gain section  2028   a/b  and saturable absorber section  2029   a/b.  As illustrated in  FIG. 20 , in this embodiment, the two ICL frequency comb lasers with slightly different comb spacings are situated at the same end of the chip to allow both to be mounted epitaxial-side-down, while the extended passive waveguide  2014   a  of the sensing region hangs over the edge of the mount to provide contact with the ambient sample gas. Both ends of each laser cavity are highly reflective, e.g., from a combination of HR-coated cleaved facets, HR-coated etched facets, and/or DBR mirrors, although this embodiment does not allow either frequency comb laser to be bounded on both sides by HR-coated cleaved facets. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , each of the frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b  (described herein as being ICLs, though QCLs can also be used) evanescently couples to a secondary passive waveguide  2014   a/b  that runs parallel to the active waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, as described above with respect to  FIGS. 9 and 10 . However, in other embodiments the output from one or both frequency comb ICLs may couple to its corresponding passive waveguide by butt-coupling the passive waveguide to a DBR mirror that defines the output end of the laser cavity. The output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL  2001   a  couples to an extended passive sensing waveguide  2014   a,  whose top surface is exposed to ambient to allow evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the ambient sample gas. Absorption by the sample gas then affects the spectral dependence of the light signal reaching the detector following traversal of the extended passive sensing waveguide. The extended passive sensing waveguide, in turn, couples to the input of an on-chip ICD  2015 . The output from the second highly stable frequency comb ICL  2001   b  (the local oscillator) evanescently couples to a second, much shorter passive waveguide  2014   b  that proceeds directly to the same ICD  2015 . The signal transmitted by the second passive waveguide is not affected significantly by exposure to the sample gas, partly due to its much shorter length, and in some embodiments also because the second passive waveguide is encapsulated so as to prevent its propagating optical mode from coupling to the sample gas. \\n     The two passive waveguides shown in this figure are coupled to the same ICD by a Y-Junction, whose single output passive waveguide butt-couples to the ICD. \\n     In an alternative embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , the input passive waveguides  2114   a/b  can evanescently couple to the two sides of an ICD or QCD  2115  rather than coupling to the detector via a Y-junction as in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 . In still other embodiments, the passive waveguides can be combined by an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) or some other means known to the art before the combined beams are coupled to the ICD or QCD. The combined photocurrent signal measured by the fast ICD due to both transmitted beams is input to an RF spectrum analyzer that determines the multi-heterodyne beating of the two ICL frequency combs with slightly different comb spacings. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , two frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b , each having a gain section  2128   a/b  and a saturable absorber section  2129   a/b,  and each having a slightly different comb spacing, are used. In this embodiment the cavity for each of the two frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b  is formed from a waveguide containing curved sections to form a laser cavity terminated at both ends at the same HR-coated cleaved facet  2102 , by analogy to the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 11  for a single laser, so that the same HR-coated cleaved facet provides both end mirrors for each of the two highly stable frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b . Both lasers can then reside at one end of the chip, while the extended passive sensing waveguide  2114   a,  the shorter passive waveguide  2114   b,  and the ICD  2115  can reside at the other end, so as to allow both frequency comb lasers to be mounted epitaxial side down while the extended passive sensing waveguide hangs over the edge of the mount to allow evanescent coupling of its top surface to the ambient sample gas. This configuration has the advantage that the common HR-coated cleaved facet, which provides both end mirrors for both frequency comb lasers, is generally much easier to process with high yield, using standard procedures, than an HR-coated etched mirror or a DBR. \\n     As in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , in this embodiment, the output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL  2101   a  couples to an extended passive waveguide  2114   a  that evanescently couples to the sample gas, followed by input to the ICD  2115 . The second highly stable frequency comb ICL  2101   b  couples to a passive waveguide  2114   b  that leads directly to the same ICD  2115  without interacting with the sample gas, or its interaction is over a very short path length. \\n     In addition, in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , both passive waveguides  2114   a/b  run parallel to an active waveguide in the ICD for some distance to allow transfer of the input beams to the detector waveguide. As in the case of embodiments where a single input waveguide couples to the detector evanescently, the embodiment that evanescently couples two input waveguides has the advantage of greater laser stability, because much lower fractions of the incoming beams are reflected back into the passive waveguides for unwanted feedback into the two lasers. However, a Y-Junction (as in  FIG. 20 ) or some other means known to the art may alternatively be used to couple both beams into the same ICD. \\n     In all of the on-chip dual-comb sensing embodiments, such as those illustrated in  FIGS. 20 and 21 , the extended waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to the sample gas can be coated with a chemical sorbent that concentrates the molecules of interest so as to substantially increase the absorption due to those molecules. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , a DFB ICL seed laser  2101 - seed  provides input to both combs, via passive waveguides  2101   c/d,  to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b  that reside on each side of the DFB laser  2101 - seed . The incorporation of a seed laser such as that shown in  FIG. 21  is optional for operation of the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy system of the invention. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 22  illustrates an exemplary PIC embodiment that employs a DFB ICL seed laser  2201 - seed  to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b  that reside on each side of the DFB laser  2201 - seed . In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 22 , similar to the manner described above with respect to  FIG. 21 , both end mirrors for all three lasers are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, although numerous other geometries are possible while maintaining the same inventive design aspects, such as bounding one or both ends of one or more of the laser cavities by DBR or etched mirrors. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 22 , two passive waveguides  2214   a  and  2214   b  are evanescently coupled to the active waveguide of the DFB ICL at each end of its cavity. Each of those passive waveguides  2114   a/b  then couples light from the DFB ICL to each of the frequency comb ICLs  2001   a/b , which may have the effect of locking them to the DFB emission wavelength, provided that wavelength is sufficiently close to one of the teeth of the frequency combs. The two comb outputs may either be emitted from the chip, e.g., at one of the end facets, or be evanescently coupled into output waveguides  2214   a/b  to be used elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a III-V or silicon PIC. \\n     Other embodiments of III-V PICs designed in accordance with the invention may provide on-chip spectral beam combining to scale the laser power that can be output into a single high-quality beam, as illustrated by the block schematic in  FIG. 23 . In this embodiment, a QCL or ICL array  2331  of DFB or DBR lasers is patterned to have slightly different grating pitches so that each laser emits at a slightly different wavelength. The outputs from the lasers in the array can be butt-coupled to passive waveguides  2314   a/b / . . . designed and processed in accordance with the invention (e.g., as described above with respect to  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B  in the case of an ICL), with partially-reflecting DBRs. In other embodiments, the refractive index mismatch at the interface between the active and passive waveguides, as shown in  FIG. 4B , defines one end mirror for each laser cavity. The outputs from the various array elements emitting at different wavelengths may then be input to an AWG  2332  for spectral beam combining into a single output waveguide  2314 -out. The array output with much higher power than each individual array element is then emitted from the chip at a single waveguide aperture  2333 . Processing protocols for mounting such an array epitaxial side down are well known to the art. \\n     In some embodiments, the same highly-stable laser cavity evanescently couples to two different passive waveguides. In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 24A , the two passive waveguides  2414   a/b  run in parallel to the laser cavity  2401  for evanescent coupling on the same side of the laser ridge but at opposite ends of the cavity. Alternatively, for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 24B  the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at the same end of the cavity, while in the embodiment shown in  FIG. 24C  the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at opposite ends of the cavity. \\n     In all of these embodiments, both passive waveguides have the same extended length with the same shape, and at the opposite end both couple to ICDs or QCDs integrated on the chip. However, one extended passive waveguide is exposed to the sample gas while the other serves as a reference because it is not exposed. For example, exposure of the reference extended waveguide to the sample gas can be prevented by encapsulating that portion of the chip in a hermetic dome that the sample gas does not penetrate. \\n     All of these embodiments have the advantage of providing a reference signal that propagates through the same length and shape of waveguide for detection by an identical ICD or QCD that nominally operates at the same temperature due to its close proximity on the chip, but which is not attenuated by absorption associated with trace chemicals in the sample gas. The extended waveguide  2414   a  that is exposed to the sample gas may be covered with a sorbent to enhance the concentration of trace chemicals of interest. In that case, the signal detected for the extended waveguide  2414   a  coated with the sorbent may be compared to the signal for a reference extended waveguide  2414   b  that is not coated with the sorbent. \\n     In some embodiments, multi-spectral detection is obtained by positioning multiple in-plane interband or quantum cascade resonant cavity infrared detectors with different resonance wavelengths along a single multi-spectral detection waveguide. \\n       FIG. 25A  illustrates an embodiment of a chemical sensing PIC that integrates on the same III-V or silicon chip a highly stable laser cavity  2501 , an extended passive waveguide  2514  whose top surface is exposed to a sample gas, and a series of multi-wavelength RCIDs  2515   a/b/  . . . that are positioned in series along the same multi-spectral detection waveguide  2534 , which receives the optical signal transmitted by the extended passive waveguide  2514 . A DBR mirror  2519  is positioned on each side of each detector in the multi-spectral series of detectors, with each set of two such DBR mirrors that bound a given RCID is formed by etching gratings with a different pitch than the gratings that form the two DBRs that bound any other RCID in the series, so that each RCID in the series operates at a different resonance wavelength. Preferably, each RCID, consisting of the detector  2515  and DBR mirrors  2519 , butt-couples to the next, with no space between the grating for one DBR with a given grating pitch and the grating for the next DBR with a different grating pitch. \\n     In the case of an ICD RCID, it may be preferable to etch the grating into the passive waveguide structure, as illustrated in  FIG. 8B , rather than into the full waveguide structure as illustrated in  FIG. 8A . This is because optical loss due to absorption in the active quantum wells can degrade the quality factor of the RCID cavities if the DBRs are formed by etching the grating into the full active structure. The absorption loss in the active quantum wells is of less concern for a QCD RCID, particularly if the DBRs are ion bombarded to trap free carriers and further reduce the loss as discussed above. \\n     The photocurrent flowing in any given RCID is sensitive primarily to incoming light having a wavelength falling within one linewidth of the resonance wavelength of that RCID, whereas most of the incoming optical signal that does not fall within the narrow spectral linewidth of that RCID is transmitted to the next RCID, since the DBR mirrors do not provide high reflection of any non-resonance wavelength, and the longitudinal length L of the absorber in each RCID is short enough that only a small fraction of the beam is absorbed during a single pass through the absorber. However, most of the spectral component of the incoming optical signal that falls within the narrow spectral linewidth of the given RCID is absorbed, since the quality factor Q of the cavity defined by the two DBRs on each side of the RCID, in combination with the longitudinal pathlength L of the absorber for that RCID, provide high absorption quantum efficiency following multiple longitudinal passes of the selected spectral portion of the beam through the RCID. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in  FIG. 25 , the multi-spectral detection waveguide  2534  terminates at an HR-coated facet  2502 , or some other broadband mirror that provides a second pass of the optical signal through the multi-spectral series of RCIDs. \\n     Each RCID in the series has a separate top contact that allows the photocurrent generated by the portion of the incoming signal falling within the selected spectral bandwidth of the given RCID to be measured. In some embodiments of a III-V PIC, the circuit is completed by a common ground contact to the substrate side of the chip, which also provides a common ground contact for all the interband or quantum cascade optical emitters on the chip. In the case of a silicon PIC, both contacts to the interband or quantum cascade RCID must be processed on the top side of the chip. \\n     By tuning each RCID to a different resonance wavelength, via the grating pitch of the DBRs surrounding that RCID, the intensity of the incoming signal can be measured as a function of wavelength. Combining the information received from the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series then provides a spectral characterization of the incoming signal. The spectral bandwidths of the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series may be designed to nearly overlap, so that a continuous spectrum can be obtained, or the resonances for the different RCIDs may be selected to detect a pre-determined set of non-contiguous wavelengths of interest. \\n     If the chemical sensing PIC employs an source with broad spectral bandwidth, such as an infrared light emitting diode (LED) such as the interband cascade LED (see C. S. Kim et al.,  Opt. Engr.  57, 011002 (2018), \u201cImproved Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade Light Emitting Devices\u201d), an infrared amplified spontaneous emission device (e.g., M. C. Zheng et al., Opt. Expr. 23, 2713, \u201cHigh power spiral cavity quantum cascade superluminescent emitter\u201d), or simply an ICL or QCL, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs can be used as the primary means for determining the spectrum for optical transmission through the extended passive waveguide  2514 . This approach may sometimes be more straightforward to implement than the series of ring resonators that is employed to provide spectral information for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 16 . An advantage of employing a silicon PIC to implement the multi-spectral series of detectors is that DBRs with low loss and high Q may be more straightforward to process with high yield (Spott,  Photonics  2016 supra) than is possible with DBRs processed on a III-V PIC. \\n     More generally, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs may be used to provide multi-spectral detection of any signal propagating in an incoming passive waveguide. For example, it may be used for multi-spectral or hyper-spectral detection or imaging that on a PIC that does not integrate optical sources on the same chip. \\n     Numerous variations on the inventive embodiments described above are possible. For example,  FIGS. 3, 5, and 19  illustrate specific passive and active waveguide configurations that provide evanescent coupling of the beam propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. A variety of alternative designs for both the semiconductor layering design and the passive waveguide profile will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, starting with a QCL III-V epitaxial structure a passive waveguide may be constructed with a bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the bottom InP cladding layer as the bottom clad of the passive waveguide. The InGaAs bottom SCL thickness should be designed for optimal operation of both the highly stable QCL and the passive waveguide. It was mentioned above that ion bombardment of the passive or active waveguide on a QCL chip may deplete the free electrons so as to further reduce the waveguide loss. QCL chips designed for LWIR operation can be used to expand the spectral coverage of III-V PICs incorporating QCLs and QCDs to on-chip chemical sensors probing wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm. \\n     When the laser output is emitted from the chip (e.g., as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 10 and 11 ), the advantageous enhanced stability that is realized when only a small fraction of the power is coupled out of the cavity per pass may be applied to diode lasers operating on any III-V substrate and emitting at any wavelength. This includes near-IR, visible, and ultraviolet diode lasers that may reside on InP, GaAs, GaN, or other III-V substrates, for which passive waveguides may be designed for compatibility with the given laser structure. While a similar enhancement of the laser stability may be induced by applying an HR coating to the output facet defining one end of the laser cavity, the invention&#39;s evanescently-coupled output from the side of the laser cavity provides simpler processing as well as much greater control over the out-coupling fraction per pass (via the double-waveguide profile, the spacer width between the two waveguides, and the distance over which the two waveguides propagate parallel to one another). \\n     In some embodiments, both ends of the highly stable laser cavity are bounded by HR-coated facets that do not provide any significant spectral selectivity. The two mirrors at opposite ends of the laser cavity may be formed by two facets cleaved on opposite ends of a chip, as illustrated in  FIG. 10 , by two mirrors located on the same cleaved facet as illustrated in  FIG. 11 , or by etching an HR-coated facet to form at least one of the mirrors. In the embodiments of  FIGS. 10 and 11 , some fraction of the light is evanescently coupled to a second waveguide that is passive, although in other embodiments the second active waveguide may be active in order to minimize loss (if biased below the gain threshold) or provide further amplification of the optical signal (if biased above the gain threshold). \\n     In other embodiments, a DBR mirror defines at least one end of the highly stable laser. Some fraction of the light can then couple into a passive or active output waveguide that emerges from the opposite end of the partially-reflecting DBR mirror, as illustrated in  FIG. 8 . Both out-coupling via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide and out-coupling at a DBR mirror provide flexibility in the trade between laser stability and out-coupling efficiency. In the case of evanescent out-coupling to a second waveguide, the fraction of light in the laser cavity that is out-coupled per pass depends on the coupling strength between the two waveguides, which may be varied through adjustment of their separation distance and waveguide profiles. In the alternative case of out-coupling from a partially-reflecting DBR mirror that defines one end of the laser cavity, the etch depth and number of periods may be tuned to adjust the mirror reflectivity. It may be more straightforward to realize a broad range of out-coupling efficiencies when the DBR mirror approach is employed. In terms of positioning it is also more flexible to define the laser cavity by DBR mirrors, since the laser can then be placed anywhere within a PIC, whereas defining the cavity with one or more HR-coated cleaved facets requires that the laser be proximate to one or more boundaries of the chip. \\n     In many embodiments, such as when stable output into a single spectral mode is desired, these two approaches to out-coupling may be used interchangeably. Which is preferable for use in a given PIC may depend in part on whether it is more straightforward to process a DBR or a double waveguide with separation close enough to provide substantial evanescent coupling. In the latter case, the laser cavity must also incorporate a DFB grating or other means of longitudinal mode selection if lasing in a single spectral mode is required. Which architecture is less challenging to fabricate with higher yield will depend in part on the material constituents, and also on the profiles and dimensions of the waveguides. However, in cases where lasing should not occur in a single spectral mode, e.g., when the laser is a frequency comb, a DBR mirror cannot be used to define either end of the laser cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, the laser source emits in a narrow spectral linewidth due to the implementation of a DFB grating. One or both ends of the cavity are then defined by DBR mirrors or some other means known to the art. In some embodiments, the narrow-linewidth emission wavelength may be tuned over some limited bandwidth by current, temperature, or some other means such as a sampled grating. The spectral bandwidth can be extended by disposing multiple laser sources on the same chip, which are coupled to multiple sensing regions, or by coupling a single laser source to multiple resonant cavities as illustrated in  FIG. 16 . Alternatively, the on-chip IR source may be a broadband emitter such as an LED or ASE source rather than a laser operating with a narrow spectral linewidth. \\n     The sensing region may consist of an extended passive waveguide, or it may take the form of a ring or other high-Q resonator (or coupled pairs of such resonators) that substantially extend the effective path length for sensing. \\n     The on-chip detector may be an ICD or QCD formed on the same III-V chip from the same epitaxial structure as the laser, or it may be formed from a different III-V, II-VI, or IV-VI active detector material bonded to the same silicon platform as the laser, or it may be an in-plane silicon bolometer processed as part of a silicon PIC. In the case of an ICD or QCD detector, the photocurrent may be collected at zero bias, at a reverse bias, or at a forward bias below the lasing threshold. The latter may be advantageous, for example, to minimize the loss induced by a detector integrated into the laser cavity as illustrated in  FIG. 6 . The absorber region of the detector may be placed within a resonant cavity for operation as a resonant cavity infrared detector by processing DBR mirrors at both ends of the absorber region. \\n     By combining these options for the MWIR optical source, the sensing region, and the detector, the spectral dependence of the absorption by the sample gas may be determined by tuning the resonance wavelength of the source, the sensing region if it incorporates a resonant cavity, or the detector. If more than one of these operates in a narrow spectral band, the resonance wavelengths must be matched by careful design and calibration, independent temperature tuning of the different regions, or some other means. Spectral information may also be obtained by combining multiple sensors on the same chip, with each operating at a different wavelength. \\n     Many of the embodiments disclosed above apply equally to PICs integrated on either a III-V or silicon substrate, while others are only advantageous when applied to III-V PICs. \\n     Some aspects of the invention may be advantageous even if an entire chemical sensing system is not integrated on the same III-V or silicon chip. For example, one or more highly stable laser sources and passive sensing waveguides in accordance with the invention may be combined on a III-V or silicon chip, in conjunction with coupling into one or more detectors that reside off the chip. Or similarly, one or more off-chip optical sources may be used in conjunction with one or more passive waveguide sensing areas and one or more infrared detectors residing on the chip. \\n     While the descriptions of the invention as applied to MWIR and LWIR PICs have assumed laser sources based on either type-II GaSb-based ICL structures or InP-based QCL structures, the invention applies equally to other cascade laser structures. These include type-I ICLs that may similarly function as ICDs when operated at zero bias, ICLs grown on InAs substrates, and QCLs grown on GaAs, InAs, GaSb, GaN, or silicon substrates. See, e.g., L. Shterengas et al., \u201cType-I Quantum Well Cascade Diode Lasers Emitting Near 3 \u03bcm,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  103, 121108 (2013). \\n     The in-plane waveguides in which the optical signals propagate may be formed entirely within the III-V semiconductor from which the active detector layers are formed, or by depositing or bonding to some other material to form the core and/or clad for a waveguide. For example, chalcogenide materials may be deposited and patterned to form waveguides within a III-V or silicon PIC. \\n     Advantages and New Features \\n     A III-V or Si PIC designed for chemical sensing that is based on any of the embodiments described in this invention will be suitable for mass production of hundreds of chemical sensors on the same chip. The individual sensors can then be singulated to form the basis for a package that is both extremely compact and inexpensive. \\n     A primary advantage of most of the disclosed embodiments is the high stability of the laser source or multiple laser sources used therein, which is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n     Although the present disclosure describes and illustrates various specific embodiments, aspects, and features, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the invention described herein is not limited to only the described embodiments, aspects, and features but also contemplates any and all modifications and alternative embodiments that are within the spirit and scope of the underlying invention described and claimed herein.

See, e.g., B. Tromborg et al., \u201cStability Analysis for a Semiconductor Laser,\u201d <i>IEEE J. Quant. Electron. </i>20,1023 (1984); V. Svedas, \u201cThe Significance of Lidar Pulse Stability in the IR Detection of Hazardous Compounds,\u201d <i>IEEE Sensors Journal </i>14, 1391 (2014); and L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMultiheterodyne Spectroscopy Using Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d <i>Opt. Engr. </i>57, 011014 (2018).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">A major source of instability is feedback from unwanted secondary optical cavities that form due to reflections from one or more surfaces encountered outside the intended primary cavity. The primary cavity of an edge-emitting diode laser is typically defined by coated or uncoated cleaved facets of the laser chip, although mirrors formed by distributed Bragg reflectors, etched facets, or other means may also be employed. While a parasitic secondary cavity may result from feedback within the chip, it is more often due to feedback from an external optic or other surface that is encountered after the beam leaves the output facet of the laser. See S. Takeda and S. Nakagawa, \u201cFeedback Tolerance of DFB Laser for Silicon Photonics Packaging,\u201d <i>Opt. Expr. </i>22, 8451 (2014).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Inevitable mechanical and thermal vibrations in a laser device cause the secondary cavity length to vary, which induces temporal \u201cjitter\u201d of the magnitude and spectral characteristics of the secondary lasing modes. Such instabilities in the lasing mode and output power can, for example, seriously degrade the sensitivity of a spectroscopy-based trace chemical measurement as a result of small variations in the laser signal transmitted through a sample gas or liquid. Although an optical isolator can minimize the feedback from external optical elements, the expense, bulk, and wavelength-specificity of such isolators make them unsuitable for incorporation into an ultra-compact chemical sensing system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">The cavity for a conventional narrow-ridge edge-emitting semiconductor laser is most commonly formed by cleaving two high-quality facets that define the two ends of the cavity. Typically, one of the facets (called the back facet) is coated for high reflection (HR), while the light generated within the laser is emitted from the other (front, or output) facet. The output facet may be left uncoated, in which case its reflectivity R is typically 25-40%, or it may be coated to optimize desired figures of merit. For example, the efficiency is generally maximized by applying an anti-reflection (AR) coating that reduces R to a few percent or less, whereas the threshold current density can be minimized by applying a coating with reflectivity higher than that of an uncoated facet (but which nonetheless allows some light to be transmitted to provide the laser output). Other means known to the art may also be employed to form the laser cavity, for example, by etching rather than cleaving one or both facets, or by processing distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. See, e.g., M. Ariga, et al., \u201cLow Threshold GaInAsP Lasers with Semiconductor/Air Distributed Bragg Reflector Fabricated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Etching,\u201d <i>Jpn. J Appl. Phys. </i>39, 3406 (2000).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">When any of those conventional configurations are employed, the stability of the laser output can be compromised by unwanted feedback from optical elements residing outside the laser cavity. In the case of emission from an end facet, for example, external optical elements may reflect light back into the cavity to provide unwanted time-variant feedback.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">In other cases, the laser cavity may be integrated on a chip with other optical components, and some means such as tapers and/or DBR mirrors may be employed to define the cavity, while transferring some fraction of the laser power into a waveguide for use elsewhere in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Lasers have been integrated with other optical components to form PICs on III-V and silicon chips, as well as other substrate platforms. While a laser integrated in a PIC and emitting into a waveguide may experience little or no parasitic feedback from external optical elements, it may nonetheless may receive parasitic feedback from downstream optical elements residing elsewhere in the PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">PICs operating at telecommunications wavelengths in the near infrared have by now become relatively mature. See C. Zhang and J. E. Bowers, \u201cSilicon photonic terabit/s network-on-chip for datacenter interconnection,\u201d <i>Optical Fiber Technology </i>44, 2 (2018)]. On the other hand, PICs operating at longer wavelengths in the extended shortwave infrared (ESWIR, defined here as \u03bb=2-3 \u03bcm), midwave infrared (MWIR, defined here as \u03bb=3-6 \u03bcm), and longwave infrared (LWIR, defined here as \u03bb=6-14 \u03bcm) spectral bands remain in the early stages of development. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,612,398 to Vurgaftman et al., entitled \u201cUltra-Broadband Photonic Integrated Circuit Platform\u201d; see also A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated 2.0 \u03bcm CW Hybrid Silicon Lasers at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>40, 1480 (2015); A.

Zhang et al., \u201cThin-Film Antimonide-Based Photodetectors Integrated on Si,\u201d <i>IEEE J. Quant. Electron. </i>54, 4000207 (2018). Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with InAs quantum wells have recently been realized by growing the III-V gain material directly on a silicon chip. See H. Nguyen-Van et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Lasers Grown on Silicon,\u201d <i>Sci. Reports </i>8, 7206 (2018). There have been several experimental demonstrations of midwave infrared (MWIR, 2.5-6 \u03bcm) QCLs and interband cascade lasers (ICLs) integrated on silicon. See e.g., &#39;398 patent, supra; see also Spott, <i>Optica </i>2016, supra; A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated Distributed Feedback Quantum Cascade Lasers on Silicon,\u201d <i>Photonics </i>3, 35 (2016) (\u201cSpott, Photonics 2016\u201d); A.

Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d <i>Optica </i>5, 996 (2018).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">Most of these have been integrated on silicon chips, although the preliminary performance of such integrated devices has been limited in part by the challenge of bonding III-V wafer material to silicon and subsequent processing of the laser ridges from the back. Most often, the optical mode in the gain region of a silicon-based PIC is \u201chybrid,\u201d in that it is shared between the III-V gain material and an underlying silicon waveguide. See Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016, supra. Tapers of the III-V mesa material are then introduced at the boundaries between the hybrid and silicon waveguide sections, in order to adiabatically couple the generated light from one waveguide to the other. However, the performance of these MWIR PICs has been limited in part by inefficient transfer (to date) at the tapers of laser power from the \u201chybrid\u201d III-V/silicon waveguide of the gain region to a passive silicon waveguide that is suitable for coupling the generated laser beam to other optical elements incorporated into a silicon-based PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">At shorter wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR), such tapers have provided efficient coupling between the two waveguide sections. See, e.g., C. Zhang, \u201cLow Threshold and High Speed Short Cavity Distributed Feedback Hybrid Silicon Lasers,\u201d <i>Opt. Expr. </i>22, 10202 (2014). In those integrated lasers, most of the optical mode in the hybrid waveguide resides in the silicon portion of the waveguide rather than the III-V portion, and so gradual tapering to a silicon waveguide introduces only a relatively minor perturbation of the mode profile.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">However, the tapers employed in the integrated QCL and ICL demonstrations to date have induced much more reflection (and in some cases loss) than transmission of the laser beam propagating in the hybrid waveguide. This is probably due in part to the requirement for a much more abrupt evolution of the mode, which in the MWIR devices has been concentrated mostly in the III-V rather than the silicon portion of the hybrid waveguide. This mode distribution has been motivated by a concern that the gain would otherwise not be sufficient to overcome the higher waveguide loss at the longer wavelength, particularly in the case of a QCL that characteristically has relatively low material gain.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">A number of demonstrations of interband cascade detectors (ICDs) and quantum cascade detectors (QCDs) have been reported in recent years. These have employed absorber and injector quantum well configurations quite similar to those used in corresponding laser structures that are designed for emission near the detector cut-off wavelength in the case of an ICD, see J. V. Li et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Detectors with Room Temperature Photovoltaic Operation,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>86, 101102 (2005), or near the intersubband resonance wavelength in the case of a QCD, see F. R. Giorgetta, \u201c16.5 \u03bcm Quantum Cascade Detector Using Miniband Transport,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>90, 231111 (2007).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">In fact, ICDs have been processed on the same chip with ICLs, see H. Lotfi et al., \u201cMonolithically Integrated Mid-IR Interband Cascade Laser and Photodetector Operating at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>109, 151111 (2016), and QCDs have been processed on the same chip with QCLs, see B. Schwarz et al., \u201cWatt-Level Continuous-Wave Emission from a Bifunctional Quantum Cascade Laser/Detector,\u201d <i>ACS Photonics </i>4, 1225 (2017), using the same multi-stage quantum well wafer material in both cases. ICDs and QCDs are capable of operating at room temperature, which is generally required for chemical sensing via evanescent coupling to a sample gas. It should be noted that neither the laser power nor the detector absorption per unit length needs to be high, since the optical beam generated by the laser can propagate a relatively long distance in the waveguide in the detector section of the chip, to allow spectroscopic detection based on attenuation by the fingerprint absorption features. However, the optical loss in the passive waveguide must be sensitive to absorption by the same gas, rather than being strongly dominated by other parasitic loss mechanisms.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">This summary is intended to introduce, in simplified form, a selection of concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Instead, it is merely presented as a brief overview of the subject matter described and claimed herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">In embodiments for which optical output from the laser cavity is required, the invention provides a means for isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized.

A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components.

id=\"h-0006\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">The aspects and features of the present invention summarized above can be embodied in various forms. The following description shows, by way of illustration, combinations and configurations in which the aspects and features can be put into practice. It is understood that the described aspects, features, and/or embodiments are merely examples, and that one skilled in the art may utilize other aspects, features, and/or embodiments or make structural and functional modifications without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">For embodiments in which light is output from the laser cavity, either for emission from the chip or for use elsewhere in a PIC residing on the chip, high laser stability is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">As described in more detail below, the building blocks needed to construct an on-chip chemical sensor in accordance with the invention include (1) a highly stable laser source, (2) low-loss passive waveguides or actively pumped/amplifying sections to enable interconnections, (3) a passive sensing waveguide with evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid, and (4) an interband or quantum cascade detector. Each of these is described below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">In some embodiments, the top of the waveguide in the sensing region may be coated with a chemical sorbent with a distinct absorption signature that selectively attaches a certain class of chemicals that diffuse into the sorbent from the sample gas. This can significantly enhance the absorption associated with a given concentration of molecules in the sample gas. Such a sensor on a single chip may provide spectroscopic sensing over some range of wavelengths between \u22482.5 \u03bcm and \u22486 \u03bcm when an interband cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip, or over some range of wavelengths between \u22484 \u03bcm and \u224812 \u03bcm when a quantum cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip. When III-V active gain and detector materials are bonded to a silicon chip to form the PIC, sources and detectors operating at any number of MWIR and LWIR wavelengths may in principle be combined on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">The present invention provides a novel and effective means for strongly suppressing laser instabilities associated with unintended external feedback. By much more effectively isolating the laser cavity on the chip, the invention substantially reduces all interactions with external elements. Although the enhanced laser stability may sometimes be traded against a reduction of the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency, an additional benefit is the potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power required to operate the laser. For some applications these trades may be highly advantageous.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">In the case of a III-V PIC, attenuation of the infrared light beam propagating in the passive waveguide is quantified by an ICD or QCD fabricated from the same III-V multi-stage active quantum well structure as the ICL or QCL. Whereas a forward bias is required to produce gain and lasing, an ICD or QCD is typically operated at or near zero bias, although a reverse bias or sub-threshold forward bias may also be applied.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Some embodiments of the present invention obviate the issue of inefficient coupling of the active and passive waveguides at the tapers, by replacing them with a more reliable means for coupling between different waveguide sections. In embodiments of the invention that employ a PIC on a III-V chip, no transfers between hybrid and silicon waveguides are required at all.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">These and other features of various embodiments of highly stable lasers and sensors integrated on the same chip are now described with reference to the FIGURES which are filed concurrently herewith and which form a part of the present disclosure. It will be noted that in the FIGURES and in the description below, elements that appear in more than one FIGURE are denoted by the same reference number, with only the first digit being changed to reflect the number of the FIGURE being described. For example, a laser cavity of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention is denoted as \u201claser cavity <b>101</b>\u201d when discussed in the context of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and as \u201claser cavity <b>601</b>\u201d when discussed in the context of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>; similarly, the narrow-ridge laser waveguide is denoted with reference number <b>103</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and with reference number <b>403</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">A highly stable interband or quantum cascade laser in accordance with the present invention is formed by creating a laser cavity with very weak interactions with any optical elements outside the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a simplest embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, such a highly stable laser includes a laser cavity <b>101</b> consisting of an ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide <b>103</b> bounded by a mirror at each end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">In this baseline configuration, the laser experiences no interactions at all with optical elements outside the laser cavity. The laser cavity illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is defined by two end facets <b>102</b> <i>a</i>/<b>102</b> <i>b </i>that are each coated with a high-reflectivity (HR) metal such as Au, with a dielectric spacer to prevent electrical shorting. In this embodiment, the two end facets are formed by cleaving the wafer from which the cavity is formed. In other embodiments, other highly reflecting end mirrors, such as etched facets with HR coatings or distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), may be employed at one or both ends of the cavity. While \u22480.5 mm represents a practical limit to the minimum cavity length that can be formed with high yield by conventional cleaving methods, shorter cavity lengths are more straightforward if a portion of the waveguide curves such that the mirrors defining both ends of the cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as discussed below, or if the cavity is defined by etching one or both facets or by processing DBRs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">A highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention may be induced to lase in a single spectral mode by first requiring the laser ridge to be narrow enough to support lasing in only a single lateral mode. DBRs may then be used at one or both ends of the laser cavity to select a single longitudinal mode, while in other embodiments, the ridge may be patterned with a distributed feedback (DFB) grating. Since there is no opportunity for feedback from an external optical element to influence operation of the laser, its stability is likely to be determined primarily by the stability of the drive electronics or by thermal fluctuations from the environment (which typically take place on a relatively long time scale). Vibrations should have little effect, since all of the internal lengths are fixed and the reflectors defining the cavity should generally vibrate in unison.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">In some embodiments, the laser ridge may be processed on its native III-V chip using conventional fabrication methods, while in other embodiments, it may be integrated on a silicon chip by growing the III-V active gain material on silicon or by growing on the native III-V substrate and then bonding to silicon as discussed above. Processing on the native III-V chip rather than silicon is generally more straightforward and less expensive, and is likely to produce higher yield.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">Of course, a laser having no interaction at all with anything outside its own cavity cannot perform any useful function. However, interaction can be obtained without introducing any potential for feedback from external optical elements by evanescently coupling some or all of the laser&#39;s ridge waveguide to an ambient sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In all of the embodiments of the invention described below, a common bottom contact on the substrate of the ICL or QCL wafer is employed, although embodiments with both contacts made to the top of the wafer may also employ the same inventive aspects. A substantial fraction of the optical mode resides in the top and bottom n<sup>\u2212</sup>-GaSb separate confinement layers (SCLs), which exhibit low loss and high refractive index.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a typical cross section for a conventional ICL narrow-ridge waveguide that is formed by processing ICL wafer material which is typically grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In preferred embodiments, the sidewalls of the ridge waveguide of the narrow-ridge ICL are etched to below the active stages to prevent current spreading in the wafer.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">The conventional narrow-ridge waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is formed by processing ICL wafer material that includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>204</b> with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>205</b> on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL) <b>206</b> on an upper surface of bottom clad <b>205</b>, active ICL gain stages <b>207</b> on an upper surface of SCL <b>206</b>, a top GaSb SCL <b>208</b> on an upper surface of the active gain stages, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad <b>209</b> on an upper surface of top SCL <b>208</b>, and a thin n<sup>+</sup>-InAs or n<sup>+</sup>-InAsSb top contact layer <b>210</b> on an upper surface of top clad <b>209</b>. A layer of a dielectric <b>211</b> such as SiN is deposited on the ridge sidewalls, followed by metallization on top of the ridge to provide a top electrical contact <b>212</b>. The bottom contact (not shown) is usually made to n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>204</b>. The arrows in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> indicate the direction of current flow when a forward bias is applied to produce gain for lasing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the cross section for an exemplary embodiment of an alternative ICL ridge waveguide that is modified such that part of the top SCL is exposed to ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, such an alternative ICL ridge waveguide, like the conventional waveguide described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>304</b> with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>305</b> on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL) <b>306</b> on an upper surface of bottom clad <b>305</b>, active ICL gain stages <b>307</b> on an upper surface of SCL <b>306</b>, a top GaSb SCL <b>308</b> on an upper surface of the active gain stages <b>307</b>, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad <b>309</b> on an upper surface of top SCL <b>308</b>, and a thin n<sup>+</sup>-InAs or n<sup>+</sup>-InAsSb top contact layer <b>310</b> on an upper surface of top clad <b>309</b>. After the narrow-ridge waveguide has been etched, a dielectric layer <b>311</b> is deposited on the sidewalls to prevent electrical shorting and metal is deposited to form a top contact <b>312</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">Unlike the conventional waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, in the waveguide in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, one sidewall of the active ICL stages <b>307</b>, the top SCL <b>308</b>, and top clad <b>309</b>, as well as a portion of bottom SCL <b>306</b> are exposed to permit coupling of the lasing mode to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The lasing threshold, slope efficiency, and maximum output power then provide information about whether the ambient sample gas contains any trace chemicals with absorption features at the laser wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">Numerous variations of this exemplary embodiment will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, in some variations, a double ridge may be formed to provide weak index guiding of the lasing mode, with the inner ridge etched to a depth above the active stages and the outer ridge etched to below the active stages. In other cases, ion bombardment can optionally be used to prevent current spreading into the outer ridge, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cWeakly Index-Guided Interband Cascade Lasers with No Grown Top Cladding Layer or a Thin Top Cladding Layer.\u201d As noted above, by depositing the dielectric and top contact metallization on only part of the ridge, the rest can remain exposed to ambient. In still other cases, a DFB grating may also be patterned into the ridge, e.g., by etching into the III-V material or by depositing Ge and patterning the grating in the Ge. See &#39;571 patent, supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">A closely analogous embodiment can be constructed using QCL gain stages for the highly stable laser rather than ICL gain stages. For the well-known case of an InP-based QCL, the substrate is InP, the active stages typically employ strain-compensated InGaAs-InAlAs quantum wells, the top and bottom cladding layers are typically n-InP, and a top and/or bottom InGaAs SCL may optionally be incorporated to maximize overlap of the optical mode with the sample gas surrounding the laser. Numerous other variations of the ridge geometry and material constituents will be obvious to one skilled in the art, and all such variations are deemed to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">QCLs can operate with high performance extending from MWIR wavelengths of 4 \u03bcm or shorter to LWIR wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm, and all of the embodiments of the invention discussed below that pertain to ICLs and/or ICDs apply equally to QCLs and/or QCDs operating at both MWIR and LWIR wavelengths.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate aspects of an exemplary embodiment of a highly stable laser that provides evanescent coupling of the laser beam propagating in the cavity to a sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">As seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>, a highly stable laser in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention includes a laser cavity <b>401</b> that is divided longitudinally into active and passive sections <b>413</b> and <b>414</b>, respectively, where the active waveguide section includes a narrow-ridge waveguide <b>403</b>. At each end of the laser cavity is an HR-coated cleaved facet <b>402</b> <i>a</i>/<b>402</b> <i>b</i>. In other embodiments, high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to an ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration of the boundary between the active ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide section and the passive waveguide section of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. While an additional reflection will occur at the boundary between the active and passive waveguide sections, due to mismatch of the modal profiles in the two sections, generally this should not seriously degrade the spectral mode selectivity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>, such an exemplary waveguide structure includes the components previously described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, including a bottom SCL <b>406</b>, ICL (or QCL) active gain stages <b>407</b>, top SCL <b>408</b>, top clad <b>409</b>, and a thin top contact layer (not shown). The active narrow-ridge waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> further includes a dielectric layer <b>411</b> on the sidewalls of the active narrow-ridge waveguide and a top metal contact layer <b>412</b> disposed on an upper surface of the top contact layer. At the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide is preferably HR-coated with a dielectric insulator and metal so that light which would otherwise be emitted into the ambient above the passive waveguide is reflected back into the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate two exemplary cross-sections of a low-loss passive waveguide section in a highly stable semiconductor laser in accordance with the present invention. These passive waveguides are formed on the same chip using the same ICL wafer material as is used for the active waveguides, with either an active or passive waveguide selected by changing the etching and other processing of a given region of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">As can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in exemplary embodiments, each of these passive waveguides includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>504</b>, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>505</b>, and a bottom GaSb SCL <b>506</b>, though other materials (superlattice or bulk materials) can be used as appropriate. The ridge for each of these passive waveguides is formed by etching away the heavily-doped top contacting layer, the top cladding layer, the top SCL, and the active gain stages, with the etch stopping near the top of the bottom SCL <b>506</b>, to provide an air top clad for the waveguide. In these embodiments, the ICL waveguide may be redesigned so that the bottom SCL is thicker than the top SCL, which can be done with only a modest reduction of the optical confinement factor for the lasing mode in the ICL. In addition, in order to avoid parasitic emission into the air above the passive waveguide due to the height and modal profile differences between the active and passive waveguides at the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide should preferably be HR coated at the interface between the active and passive waveguides.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref>, part of the InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer <b>505</b> is also removed laterally outside the ridge, with the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stopping near the top of InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer <b>505</b>. Alternatively, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stops within the bottom SCL <b>506</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">In both cases, the air top clad of the passive waveguide in accordance with the present invention is suitable for evanescently coupling the optical mode propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. The beam propagates in the ridge waveguide formed by the bottom n<sup>\u2212</sup>-GaSb SCL <b>506</b> as its core, the bottom superlattice cladding layer <b>505</b> (along with a portion of bottom SCL in the embodiment of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>) as its bottom clad, and air as its top clad. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the sample gas or liquid. DFB gratings may be added in the active waveguide section of the cavity in a manner described below, or spectral mode selectivity may be imposed by processing DBR gratings at one or both ends of the cavity, rather than by terminating both ends of the cavity by cleaved facets with HR coatings. In either embodiment, the layer thicknesses, waveguide widths, and etch depths must be designed such that light propagating through the passive waveguide can be optically confined. In addition, in both embodiments, the tops and sides of the waveguide are suitable for evanescently coupling the propagating light to an ambient sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">In other cases, a structure analogous to the one shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> can be used to construct a highly stable QCL in which the passive waveguide section is formed using a thick bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the InP lower cladding layer of the laser as the clad.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">Numerous variations on the waveguide geometry and material constituents for this passive waveguide will be obvious to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide sections can be made relatively long, e.g., as long as <b>1</b> cm or more, to enhance the chemical detection sensitivity, since in most cases the passive waveguide loss will be low and absorption by the sample gas weak unless the chemical species of interest is present with a high concentration. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide extending from the gain region to the end of the cavity may follow a straight path. In other embodiments, it may follow a winding path that provides the same total passive waveguide length with greater compactness on the chip. In some embodiments, the winding or curved path of the passive waveguide may terminate at a mirror provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet as the mirror at the other end of the cavity. Embodiments in which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by termination at the same HR-coated cleaved facet will be discussed further below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">The spectral characteristics of the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity are modified by the presence or absence of a chemical species of interest. As a result, a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention can be incorporated into a sensor to detect the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas incident on the sensor, where the presence of the gas is detected through changes in the threshold current, slope efficiency, and/or power of the highly stable laser operating in the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">In some embodiments, the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas can be detected by monitoring the compliance voltage in the I-V characteristics of the highly stable laser when a constant current is injected. See M. C. Phillips et al., \u201cIntracavity Sensing via Compliance Voltage in an External Cavity Quantum Cascade Laser,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>37, 2664 (2012). When the loss due to absorption of the laser beam by the sample gas increases, the lasing threshold increases and the radiative recombination rate decreases at a given current injection level above threshold. Therefore, a higher voltage must be applied to maintain the same current. Phillips et al., supra, observed a 0.15 V increase of the compliance voltage for a QCL emitting near 7.7 \u03bcm when the laser wavelength was swept across an absorption line of water vapor. In that experiment, the sample gas resided in an external region of the laser cavity (which also provided tuning of the laser wavelength), rather than being evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in a passive waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">Without an external cavity to tune the wavelength, the present invention can sweep across the absorption resonance by current or temperature tuning, where the dependence of compliance voltage on current is compared to that observed when the chemical species of interest is not present in the sample gas or liquid. In other embodiments, different lasers on the same chip can be tuned to different DFB or DBR wavelengths to provide a reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">The compliance voltage method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas may be combined with either evanescent coupling within the gain region, as in the case shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> with an active waveguide cross section such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, or when the waveguide in the laser cavity is divided into active and passive sections as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">For the case of an ICL, the passive waveguide could have a cross section such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. Measurement of the compliance voltage to monitor absorption by the sample gas can be applied either to ICLs or, as in the experiment reported by Phillips et al., to QCLs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">A second method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas of a laser beam propagating within a highly stable laser cavity is to incorporate an additional detector waveguide section into the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">This is shown schematically in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, a sensor in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> includes a laser cavity <b>601</b> having HR-coated end facets <b>602</b> <i>a</i>/<b>602</b> <i>b</i>, although in other embodiments high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The laser cavity contains a detector waveguide section <b>615</b> on one side of an active gain waveguide <b>613</b>, with a passive sensing waveguide <b>614</b> section on the other side of the active gain waveguide, where the top surface of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating optical mode to a sample gas or liquid as in the discussion above. In other embodiments, the detector waveguide section and the sensing waveguide section may be positioned on the same side of the active gain waveguide, rather than on opposite sides. The photocurrent measured by the detector, which may be an ICD or QCD, depends on the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity. The lasing wavelength can be tuned by varying the operating temperature, by varying the current flowing through the active gain waveguide, or by other means; in such cases, the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity will depend on the spectral characteristics of the absorption of the optical mode due to its evanescent coupling to the sample gas in the sensing waveguide section. The photocurrent measured by the detector will then provide information about the spectral characteristics of the absorption by the sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">In other embodiments, the detector may also be placed inside the laser cavity when evanescent coupling to the sample gas occurs within the active gain section, as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. In such cases, the laser cavity includes an active gain waveguide section and a detector waveguide section, but no separate passive waveguide section. The active gain waveguide section and detector waveguide section must be separately contacted, with a gap in between to prevent crosstalk between the two sections. In some embodiments, a DBR may be positioned between the gain and detector sections of the waveguide to reduce the loss of the laser cavity. The DBR can cause the laser to operate in a single spectral mode, preferably with the detector waveguide extending beyond its absorption length before another reflecting element is encountered. Alternatively, if a second DBR is placed at the other end of the detector waveguide, the detector can be made to function as a resonant cavity IR detector (RCID) with the same resonance wavelength as the laser. See U.S. Pat. No. 10,297,699 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cIn-Plane Resonant-Cavity Infrared Photodetectors with Fully-Depleted Absorbers.\u201d The opposite end of the laser cavity can be defined by an additional DBR, or by a broadband HR mirror such as a coated cleaved facet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">As noted above, both ICLs and QCLs may be operated as detectors if zero bias, a reverse bias, or a sub-threshold forward bias is applied rather than the above-threshold forward bias needed to produce lasing, with the resulting photocurrent being monitored to quantify the strength of the propagating optical signal. See Li et al., supra, and Giorgetta et al. (2007), supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">In the example of an ICL operated under forward bias to produce gain, the electron injector with chirped quantum well thicknesses transfers electrons from the semimetallic interface to the active electron quantum wells, where they recombine with holes in the active hole quantum well. In an ICD, however, electrons that are photoexcited in the active quantum wells of a given stage flow \u201cdownhill\u201d through the electron injector toward the semimetallic interface, where they recombine with photoexcited holes from the next stage. Thus, whereas a single electron injected electrically into an N-stage ICL can produce N photons, an ICD requires N photons to transfer a single electron across all the stages to provide photocurrent. The cut-off wavelength of the ICD is roughly equal to the emission wavelength of the ICL, since both are determined by the bandgap of the active quantum wells and that bandgap does not change substantially with the application of a forward or reverse bias. Whereas the photocurrent must compete with the noise induced by thermally-generated electrons that traverse the same path, a very high detectivity is not required because the detector residing inside the laser cavity experiences a high photon flux.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">However, the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity must be short enough that loss associated with absorption of the lasing photons does not seriously degrade the laser performance. To minimize the loss, it may be advantageous to apply a sub-threshold forward bias to the detector waveguide section of the cavity, which will lower the loss in the cavity while still allowing photocurrent to be generated. The advantage of lower loss must be weighed against the disadvantage that the detector noise current will be higher when a sub-threshold forward bias is applied. It may, in fact, be beneficial to monitor the detector response as a function of sub-threshold bias current.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">The operation of a quantum cascade detector is quite similar, except that intersubband absorption then provides photocurrent across the active stages when a reverse, zero, or sub-threshold forward bias is applied to the structure. In the case of a QCD, the maximum absorption in the detector waveguide section occurs at a wavelength that is noticeably longer than the same structure&#39;s QCL emission wavelength, since before absorption the electrons in thermal equilibrium or quasi-thermal equilibrium reside primarily in a subband that is about two optical phonon energies lower than the subband corresponding to the lower lasing level. The role of the lower subband is to ensure rapid depopulation of the lower lasing level following stimulated emission. In spite of this mismatch, the higher subband that contributes to absorption at the emission wavelength is sufficiently populated at room temperature for the absorption coefficient to reach several cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, according to simulations by the inventors. In many cases this will be sufficient to allow the light intensity propagating in the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity to be monitored.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">The spectral dependence of the highly stable laser intensity in the presence of evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid can be determined by tuning the laser wavelength with current or temperature, by using a sampled grating to increase the tuning range, see S. Kim, \u201cDesign and Analysis of Widely Tunable Sampled Grating DFB Laser Diode Integrated With Sampled Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector,\u201d <i>IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. </i>16, 15 (2004), or by placing multiple lasers with slightly different operating wavelengths (e.g., tuned by varying the DFB or DBR grating pitch) on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">The emitter areas of a sensing chip employing any of these embodiments will be suitable for gold electro-plating above the contact metallization, to enhance the thermal dissipation for better laser and detector performance. In the case of intra-cavity evanescent coupling to the sample gas via an exposed sidewall of the laser ridge, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, epitaxial-side-down mounting for further enhancement of the thermal dissipation will be possible only if the processing provides an air pocket that allows the sample gas access to the exposed sidewall of the ridge. Since it may be quite challenging to incorporate such an air pocket, it will be more straightforward to apply epitaxial-side-down mounting to the emitter areas of embodiments that provide evanescent coupling to the sample gas via a passive waveguide section of the laser cavity, as in the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment in which this is accomplished by flip-chip bonding the active gain region of the laser cavity to a heat sink, while leaving the passive sensing waveguide section hanging over the edge of the heat sink to provide access to the sample gas. Thus, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a single chip <b>716</b> containing multiple highly stable laser cavities <b>701</b> <i>a</i>/<b>701</b> <i>b</i>, etc, each comprising active gain waveguide and passive sensing waveguide sections <b>713</b> and <b>714</b>, where the chip can be mounted epitaxial-side-down on a patterned heat sink submount <b>717</b>. After epitaxial-side-down mounting on the patterned submount, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7B</figref>, the passive sensing waveguide sections of all the laser cavities extend over the edge of the submount to provide exposure of the passive sensing waveguide sections to the ambient sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> also illustrate that the active gain waveguide sections of multiple lasers on the same chip can be epitaxial-side-down mounted in this manner, as long as they are all at the same end of the chip and the passive sensing waveguide sections at the other end of the chip can all be exposed over the edge of the mount. It may be more straightforward to mount multiple lasers on the chip epitaxial side down, while another portion of the chip hangs over the edge of the thermal mount to allow access to an ambient sample gas, when both ends of all the laser cavities terminate at the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as will be discussed below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">In some embodiments of the invention, output from the highly-stable laser is coupled into a passive waveguide, e.g., such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> for the case of an ICL PIC, for chemical sensing or some other functionality elsewhere on the PIC. In some of these embodiments, the mirror at one or both ends of the highly-stable laser cavity is formed by butt-coupling the active and passive waveguides as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>. Due to the mismatch of the modal refractive index at the interface between the two waveguide sections, part of the beam is reflected back into the laser cavity to provide feedback.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">As discussed above, a dominant contribution to the instability of semiconductor lasers is often unwanted feedback from external optical elements. This effect can be especially strong in the case of a conventional edge-emitting configuration in which the output facet of the cleaved cavity is either AR coated (reflectivity R\u22642%) or uncoated (typically R\u224825-40%). In both cases, a significant fraction of the light that is returned to the facet following reflection by an external element is transmitted back into the cavity. Therefore, suppressing the feedback from external elements can lead to a substantial enhancement of the laser stability.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">One approach to reducing the external feedback is to increase the reflectivity of the output facet to as high as about 90%. In applying this approach as well as the other embodiments discussed below, there is a trade-off between degraded stability when the reflectivity is low against lower maximum output power and efficiency when it is high. A further consideration is that the internal laser operation is more efficient when the mirrors at both ends of the cavity have high reflectivity. The cavity can then be shortened without causing excessive mirror loss, which provides a potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power. The most straightforward approach to increasing the reflectivity at a facet while still allowing output is to deposit a multi-layer Bragg dielectric coating. However, such coatings can be expensive and challenging to apply, especially at longer wavelengths where each layer becomes proportionally thicker.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">An alternative approach to increasing the reflectivity of an output mirror is to use a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror rather than a cleaved facet to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates an exemplary first- or third-order DBR mirror <b>819</b> that defines one end of a highly stable ICL cavity having the layer structure described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>, the etch for the DBR preferably stops just above the active ICL gain stages <b>807</b>, which means that current spreading into those stages can minimize loss in the DBR section of the waveguide that does not have a top contact to provide current injection. Whereas the current injected into a conventional diode laser spreads a few microns at most, it is known that the current injected into an ICL or QCL typically spreads laterally by &gt;100 \u03bcm. See Forouhar et al., \u201cReliable Mid-Infrared Laterally-Coupled Distributed-Feedback Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>105, 051110 (2014); see also U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571, supra. Due to limitations of the practical etch depth and sidewall angle that can be achieved routinely for a given grating period when GaSb-based laser structures are processed with reactive ion etching, the processing yield is likely to be higher if a third-order grating is employed rather than a first-order grating. For the case of an exemplary ICL emitting at 3.5 \u03bcm, the grating period is then roughly 1.5 \u03bcm, and it is preferable that the grating comprise &gt;100 periods if high reflectivity is desired. An analogous DBR mirror can similarly be patterned into QCL structures. In the case of a InP- or GaAs-based QCL emitting at a wavelength beyond 4 \u03bcm, it may be practical to employ a first-order rather than third-order grating, since those material systems are less challenging to etch with steep sidewall angles, and the period also scales wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">The reflectivity of the DBR mirror can be tuned to a desired value by varying the grating length (number of periods) or the etch depth, to produce the desired trade-off between laser stability and laser power. For maximum reflection by a mirror that is not intended for output, a simulation by the inventors of the ICL structure shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref> indicates that a grating length of at least 100 \u03bcm is preferred, which with an etch depth of 1.1 \u03bcm is projected to produce a reflectivity of \u224890%. Whereas a longer grating would provide higher reflectivity, there is a limit to how far current injected from the top metal contact will spread into the DBR. Any unpumped outer portion of the DBR that does not receive very much current will be lossy, although this loss will be mitigated somewhat by self-pumping from the laser light reaching those portions of the DBR. Any loss that results will limit the maximum attainable mirror reflectivity. In some embodiments, the etched notches between the DBR teeth can be filled with a dielectric such as SiN, with a metal contact applied to the top of the DBR teeth so that current can be injected into the active stages of the DBR section of the waveguide to minimize the loss. In other embodiments, a dielectric such as SiN can be deposited over the entire top of the DBR, so that metal can be deposited on top of the dielectric for epitaxial-side-down mounting. In any embodiment for which a dielectric fills the notches in the DBR, the grating pitch must naturally be adjusted so as to account for the altered modal refractive index in the DBR section of the waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">When a DBR is used as the output mirror, its reflectivity can be adjusted for optimal trade-off between laser stability and maximum laser power, as discussed above. The beam from an ICL that includes such a DBR can be output to a passive waveguide section that begins just beyond the final DBR period. This passive waveguide can then be directed elsewhere on the chip for use in a PIC, or to an output facet for emission from the chip. In the latter case, feedback from the chip&#39;s output facet should be minimized by depositing an AR coating, and possibly also tilting the passive waveguide with respect to the output facet. When the III-V laser is integrated on a silicon PIC platform, it is relatively straightforward to provide a DBR by pre-patterning it into the silicon before the active III-V gain material is bonded and processed. See Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016, supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>, the DBR is formed in a passive waveguide structure such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, rather than in the full active waveguide as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>. The grating is then etched into the passive waveguide to a depth stopping within the bottom SCL layer <b>806</b> or the bottom cladding layer <b>805</b>. While there will be a greater mismatch of the mode in the laser&#39;s narrow ridge waveguide <b>803</b> and that in the passive waveguide of the DBR <b>819</b>, an advantage for some configurations is a lower loss due to removal of the active quantum wells. This may be more important in the case of an ICL rather than QCL PIC, since in the absence of a forward bias the active quantum wells in an ICL display higher optical loss.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\">In other embodiments of the invention, feedback from optical elements external to the laser cavity (residing either external to the chip or elsewhere on the chip if the laser is integrated into a PIC) is reduced to enhance the laser stability by extracting light via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide that runs parallel to the primary active gain waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, rather than the conventional extraction of light at a partially-transmissive end mirror (or alternatively, by using a second-order diffraction grating to emit light out of the plane).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross-section of one embodiment for the two parallel waveguides at the HR-coated facet.

Both the active and passive waveguides are coated with a top metal contact layer <b>912</b>. The preferred separation between the two waveguides is \u2248300 nm to \u22482 \u03bcm, and the space between them is filled with a layer <b>911</b> <i>b </i>of a dielectric that has low loss at the emission wavelength, such as SiN in the case of the ICLs. The etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> and in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref>, or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>.

In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, light from a laser cavity <b>1001</b> is extracted from the highly stable laser via evanescent coupling of the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1003</b> to a second (passive) waveguide <b>1014</b> that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1003</b> over some portion of the laser cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, the light coupled into the passive waveguide propagates to a third facet <b>1002</b> <i>c</i>, which is cleaved orthogonally to the two facets that define opposite ends of the laser cavity, with the light emitted from the chip via the third facet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\">Once a desired fraction of the beam has been coupled into the passive waveguide <b>1014</b>, it angles away from primary active waveguide <b>1003</b> and is directed either toward a facet <b>1002</b> <i>c </i>for emission from the chip as output <b>1021</b> (as shown in the FIGURE), or elsewhere on the chip for functionality within a PIC (not shown). In the former case, the facet at which light is emitted may be AR coated, and/or the passive waveguide may intersect the facet at a sufficiently large angle with respect to normal, as shown in the figure, that reflection at the emission facet is minimized. Reflection at the emission facet <b>1002</b> <i>c </i>would reduce the output power, and also couple reflected light back into the laser cavity <b>1001</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\">To provide single-mode operation of the highly stable laser, in some embodiments, a DFB grating may be fabricated in the active waveguide of the laser cavity, while in other embodiments, the cavity may be bounded by high-reflectivity DBRs rather than HR-coated facets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\">In still other embodiments, the highly stable laser may also be configured as an interband cascade laser (ICL) frequency comb. See Bagheri et al., \u201cPassively mode-locked interband cascade optical frequency combs,\u201d <i>Sci. Reports </i>8, 3322 (2018), which was co-authored by some of the inventors of the present invention. In such embodiments, the laser cavity is divided into two separately-contacted sections, where one section provides gain while the other serves as a saturable absorber (SA). The SA section may be ion bombarded to shorten the carrier lifetime for faster recovery of the absorption condition, and a reverse bias may also be applied to further shorten the lifetime. That configuration can provide passive mode locking, with emission in a pulse length shorter than <b>1</b> picosecond.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a highly stable laser in which light is extracted via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide <b>1114</b> that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1103</b> over some section of the laser cavity. In this embodiment, the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet. Apart from the paths followed, the geometries of the active and passive waveguides may be the same as for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>. In embodiments for which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, the bending radius should preferably be large enough that bending loss remains a small fraction of the net waveguide loss. Again, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\">The active waveguide that forms the cavity of the highly stable laser may be straight, and connect two HR-coated cleaved facets, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, or it may be curved such that both end mirrors are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>. In both cases, gold electroplating may be applied to the active waveguide to improve heat dissipation, which optionally may be followed by epitaxial-side-down mounting to a substrate or other mount. In addition, in both cases, the output beam propagating in the passive waveguide can be directed to a facet for emission from the chip as output <b>1021</b>/<b>1121</b>, as shown in the FIGURES, or it may be directed to some other region of a PIC for on-chip chemical sensing or some other function. Although <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show the output waveguide that evanescently couples to the primary waveguide of the laser cavity to be a passive waveguide, in other cases, the output waveguide may be an active waveguide that maintains the active gain stages, top SCL, top clad, and top contact layer.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\">In the case of a highly stable QCL, the loss in the full gain region without a bias is relatively low, so the passive waveguide may optionally comprise the entire QCL structure with the same processing, ridge width, and etch depth(s) used to form the narrow ridge of the passive waveguide as was used to form the narrow ridge of the active waveguide, except that no dielectric is needed on the sidewalls, no metal is deposited on top for contacting, and no bias is applied. The loss in the passive QCL waveguide may be reduced further by ion bombardment. See U.S. Pat. No. 9,450,053 to Anish Goyal et al., entitled \u201cPhotonic Integrated Circuits Based On Quantum Cascade Structures.\u201d However, in the case of a highly stable ICL, the loss in the output waveguide will be quite high if the entire ICL gain structure is retained. Therefore, the active stages should be etched away as discussed above to form a low-loss passive waveguide such as those shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, or the entire ICL structure should be retained, including a top contact which provides a forward bias at a level high enough to reduce the loss to an acceptable level. Alternatively, an output waveguide comprising the full QCL or ICL structure can be contacted and biased above threshold to provide further amplification of the laser signal.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\">The strength of coupling between the primary and secondary waveguides may be tuned by varying the separation distance between the two waveguides, the depth of the etch in the region separating them, and/or the length over which they run in parallel. A broad range of net coupling strengths can be induced by varying one or more of these design parameters. The net coupling strength will govern the trade-off between laser stability (maximized when the coupling is weak) and maximum output power and efficiency (maximized when the coupling is strong). The maximum coupling is obtained when the region separating the active and passive waveguides is not etched at all. The inventors have simulated the coupling between active and passive waveguides, similar to those illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 2 and 5A</figref>, respectively, corresponding to a typical design for an ICL emitting at a wavelength around 3.5 \u03bcm. If both waveguides are 5 \u03bcm wide and separated by 500 nm, with no etch of the region separating them, the simulation predicts that a maximum of \u224827% of the light can be transferred from the active to the passive waveguide, which occurs over a coupling length of \u224819 \u03bcm along the longitudinal axis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\">In other embodiments, a highly stable laser may generate gain in a hybrid III-V/silicon waveguide processed on a silicon platform.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a coupling approach that is projected to transfer the beam more efficiently while maintaining highly stable laser operation. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>, QCL or ICL gain material is heterogeneously bonded to a pre-processed silicon platform to form a laser cavity with a hybrid narrow-ridge waveguide. See Spott, <i>Optica </i>2016, supra. Preferably, both ends of the laser cavity are bounded by high-reflectivity mirrors. In some embodiments, one or both high-reflectivity mirrors may be an HR-coated facet. In other embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>, the III-V ridge extends beyond both ends of the laser cavity, which is bounded and defined by two DBR mirrors <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>which are patterned into the silicon before the III-V gain material is bonded thereto, where the DBR mirrors preferably induce nearly 100% reflectivity in the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\">The lasing mode resides primarily in a first III-V/silicon hybrid waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a</i>, whose silicon portion is a narrow ridge that was pre-patterned in the silicon platform before the two materials were heterogeneously bonded. Following the heterogeneous bonding, the narrow silicon ridge lies underneath the III-V ridge. It is narrower than the III-V ridge, and extends along the entire laser cavity (and beyond) along a straight path. In addition, a second pre-processed silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b</i>, which is also narrower than the III-V ridge is laterally separated from the first narrow silicon ridge by some distance and runs parallel to the first silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a </i>along some portion of the laser cavity, but at some point begins to follow an angular trajectory that finally exits the III-V mesa and the laser cavity. The second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>extends well beyond the DBR mirror <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>at a first end of the gain cavity to provide loss outside the gain cavity without inducing any parasitic reflections that can feed light back into the laser cavity. Once it has completely emerged from the III-V mesa, the second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>is a passive waveguide that provides the output of light from the integrated QCL or ICL in the form of a passive waveguide <b>1214</b>. The output light can either be emitted from the chip, or directed elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\">This structure also avoids many of the processing challenges that occur when tapers are introduced to transfer the mode between active and passive waveguides, as well as optical losses that can occur at the tapers. Furthermore, highly reflecting DBRs are straightforward to pattern in the silicon waveguide before the III-V gain material is bonded.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0123\">As in some of the embodiments discussed previously, there will be a trade-off between higher laser stability when the coupling to the emission silicon waveguide is weak, and higher power transferred to that waveguide when it is stronger. The coupling strength of the emission silicon waveguide to the lasing mode can be controlled by how close its straight portion (to the left in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>) is to the center of the optical mode profile that nominally corresponds to the middle of the III-V active mesa, as well by the length of the straight section. This straight portion precedes its angular section that leads to its departure from the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0124\">In some embodiments, silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a </i>may be eliminated, with the optical mode at the end of the cavity that does not include the second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>(to the right in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>) residing almost entirely in the active III-V gain material which is bounded below by air (or a dielectric). Note that this and related embodiments may provide efficient out-coupling for both QCLs and ICLs that are heterogeneously integrated with silicon.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0125\">In some embodiments of the invention, an on-chip chemical sensor is formed by coupling the highly stable laser to a sensing region that is not incorporated within the laser cavity as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\">In the subset of embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>, a portion of the lasing mode is evanescently coupled into a passive waveguide <b>1314</b> as discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>. Some section of the passive waveguide <b>1314</b> has an air top cladding, as in the configurations illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, so as to provide evanescent coupling to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The other end of the passive waveguide then couples to a detector waveguide section <b>1315</b> that also resides on the chip. The detector may be processed to have the same narrow ridge active waveguide or a similar active waveguide to the narrow ridge waveguide used in the highly-stable laser cavity. As discussed above and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>, the detector waveguide may optionally be bounded by DBRs that cause it to function as an RCID with increased sensitivity within the linewidth of the spectral resonance. Like the narrow ridge waveguide in the laser cavity, the detector waveguide has a top electrical contact that is used to detect a photocurrent due to light propagating in the detector waveguide when it is operated at zero bias, under a reverse bias, or under a forward bias below that required to reach the lasing threshold.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\">In the case of a III-V PIC, an interband cascade detector (ICD) or quantum cascade detector (QCD) may be formed from the same active structure as the ICL or QCL source, as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref> and as discussed above regarding the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternatively, if the PIC resides on a silicon substrate, the III-V laser and detector structures bonded to the silicon chip may be the same or different.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a sensor in which a highly stable laser <b>1301</b> in accordance with the present invention, an extended passive sensing waveguide <b>1314</b>, and an ICD/QCD <b>1315</b> all reside on the same III-V chip. In III-V PIC embodiments such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>, the passive waveguide <b>1314</b> that provides sensing may be extended to whatever length optimizes the sensitivity of the response of the ICD/QCD <b>1315</b> to the presence of the sample gas or liquid impinging on the sensor. The path followed by the waveguide in the sensing region can be straight or, as illustrated in the FIGURE, can be circuitous, so long as the path&#39;s minimum curvature does not induce an excessive bending loss. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref> B illustrates that in some embodiments, the ICD or QCD <b>1315</b> is an in-plane resonant cavity detector that is bounded on both sides by Bragg mirrors <b>1319</b> (Meyer et al. &#39;699 patent, supra).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\">In other embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, the passive sensing waveguide may take the form of one or more ring resonators <b>1424</b> evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity <b>1401</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\">In such embodiments, the highly stable laser beam propagating in the laser cavity couples evanescently to a ring resonator <b>1424</b> formed by a passive waveguide whose top and/or sides are exposed to the ambient sample gas or liquid. The intensity of the light propagating in the ring is quantified by evanescently coupling the ring resonator to a waveguide <b>1414</b> that leads to a detector <b>1415</b> that absorbs the emission wavelength of the laser and resonance wavelength of the ring. As described above, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide with respect to the active waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. Naturally, the highly stable laser <b>1401</b> must emit at least some light at the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator, and the detector <b>1415</b> must be sensitive to light that is incident at that wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\">Evanescent coupling of the laser to the ring resonator(s) may be realized by placing one section of the ring waveguide in close proximity to the laser waveguide, or by shaping the ring as a racetrack that evanescently couples to the laser cavity over an extended length. The ring resonator <b>1424</b> may have any closed-loop shape that assures low bending loss and a high quality factor Q. Coupling to the ring resonator or to a coupled mode of two ring resonators of slightly different sizes may induce the laser to operate in a single-spectral mode, without requiring the formation of a DFB grating or DBR mirrors. Some of the present inventors previously evanescently coupled ICLs to ring resonators, which was shown to induce laser emission in a single spectral mode. See W. W. Bewley et al., \u201cSingle-Mode Interband Cascade Lasers with Coupled Ring Resonators,\u201d <i>Conference on Lasers and Electro</i>-<i>Optics </i>(2011).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, the ring also evanescently couples to a passive waveguide <b>1414</b> that leads to a detector <b>1415</b> that interrogates the intensity of the optical beam output from the ring resonator. Therefore, measuring the photocurrent flowing in the detector while the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator is varied by temperature tuning or some other means can provide information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas or liquid. Furthermore, multiple ring resonators with different resonance wavelengths, along with detectors associated with each ring resonator, can provide information over a broader spectral range. If the sample gas contains a chemical species that absorbs light at the ring&#39;s resonance wavelength, the output from the ring is reduced by an amount related to the concentration of the absorbing gas species. The net absorption by the gas is enhanced significantly by the many round-trip passes through the high-Q ring cavity. The resonance wavelength of the ring may be tuned to coincide with an absorption feature of a given chemical species by varying the temperature of the sensing area, which in some embodiments may be controlled separately from the temperatures of the source and detector. If no chemical species in the sample gas absorbs at a resonance wavelength within the range that is scanned when the temperature is varied, the detected signal should not vary appreciably with resonance wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\">In both of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, a passive connecting waveguide, which for an ICL PIC consists only of the core and cladding layers as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, butt-couples directly to the detector waveguide that contains the full ICD or QCD structure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\">If the platform is a III-V PIC, the detector is an ICD or QCD formed from the same wafer material as the laser. In other embodiments, the platform may be formed from a different III-V material if multiple III-V active components are bonded to a common silicon PIC platform for coupling to silicon passive waveguides that form the ring resonator and passive connecting waveguides. Again, the detector may employ an unpatterned active waveguide, or function as an RCID for higher sensitivity if both boundaries of the absorber are bounded by DBRs as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the optical mode propagating in a passive waveguide <b>1514</b> evanescently couples to an adjacent detector waveguide <b>1515</b>, which is also shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15B</figref>. The geometry of the two waveguides is entirely analogous to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, which evanescently couples light propagating in the primary waveguide of a laser cavity to the secondary passive waveguide. In the case of evanescent coupling of the passive waveguide to a detector, the coupling strength should be maximized to the extent possible. With sufficient parallel coupling pathlength, nearly half the light can be transferred to the detector waveguide. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide that runs parallel to the detector waveguide may be bounded by DBRs that maximize the coupling strength for light at the resonant wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0136\">To use the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13-15</figref> for on-chip spectroscopic sensing, the laser drive current and/or the temperature of the chip or some portion of the chip may be varied so as to tune the laser wavelength and/or ring resonance wavelength across a narrow fingerprint absorption feature of a given chemical species that may be present in the sample gas. To probe the optical absorption by the sample gas over a broader range of wavelengths, the highly stable laser may be configured as a sampled grating laser whose emission wavelength can be tuned over the entire spectral bandwidth of the gain material. See Kim et al., supra. A given thermal shift of the refractive index of the gain and/or ring resonator material then induces a larger tuning range than can be obtained by tuning a single optical mode.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\">In other embodiments, current may be injected into the emitter waveguide at a level below the lasing threshold, so that it functions as a light emitting device (LED) or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) device with emission extending over a broader spectral band (much broader in the case of the LED). In those embodiments, a ring resonator waveguide that evanescently couples to the sample gas, and/or the resonance wavelength of an RCID formed by placing DBRs at each end of the detector&#39;s absorber waveguide, may filter the broadband output of the emitter to allow the spectral dependence of absorption by the sample gas to be determined on a much finer wavelength scale.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0138\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which a single LED, ASE, or tunable ICL or QCL source <b>1625</b> emits into a passive bus waveguide <b>1614</b>, and then a series of single or coupled ring resonators <b>1624</b> <i>a/b/c/d . . . n, </i>each of which is tuned to a different resonance wavelength, evanescently couples to the same passive bus waveguide. The passive waveguides used for the bus, ring resonators, and connectors leading to the detectors may be formed from the lower SCL of the laser structure as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0139\">Each ring in the series selectively extracts its own resonance wavelength from the bus to allow the spectral dependence of the absorption to be determined. Each ring also couples into a passive waveguide <b>1614</b> <i>/a/b/ </i>. . . , which in turn couples into to a corresponding ICD or QCD <b>1615</b> <i>a/b/c/d . . . n, </i>whose absorber waveguide section may optionally be bound at both ends by DBRs to form an RCID. This is analogous to an embodiment described by the inventors of the present invention in U.S. Pat. No. 10,333,011 supra except that the &#39;011 patent described an on-chip chemical sensor residing on a silicon platform, with silicon-based passive bus, ring resonator, and connecting waveguides, whereas the on-chip sensor illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref> instead incorporates the entire chemical sensing system on a III-V PIC chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0140\">In other embodiments of the invention, multiple on-chip sensors, each operating at a different resonance wavelength, are integrated onto the same III-V PIC. The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which each in a series of ring resonators <b>1724</b> <i>a/b/c . . . </i>(or ring resonator pairs) evanescently couples to its own corresponding highly stable laser or broadband optical source with corresponding narrow-ridge waveguides <b>1703</b> <i>a/b/c </i>. . . , in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>. Each ring resonator is exposed to the sample gas and couples to an ICD or QCD <b>1715</b> <i>a/b/c </i>. . . that measures the beam intensity at the resonance wavelength of the given sensing element. Although three sensing elements operating at three different resonance wavelengths \u03bb<sub>1</sub>, \u03bb<sub>2</sub>, and \u03bb<sub>3 </sub>are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>, any number sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0141\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which multiple extended passive sensing waveguides <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c </i>reside on the same chip in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor embodiment described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>. In this embodiment, emission from each of an array of highly stable laser cavities <b>1801</b> <i>a/b/c </i>(or broadband LEDs or ASE sources) is input into a corresponding extended passive waveguide <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c, </i>etc., where the passive waveguides have air top claddings that allow evanescent coupling to the sample gas. Corresponding ICDs or QCDs <b>1815</b> <i>a/b/c </i>that are coupled to each extended passive sensing waveguide <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c </i>measure the signal traversing the full length of each such passive waveguide, with each sensing element operating independently of the others. Again, although three independent sensing elements operating at three different wavelengths are illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>, any number of sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0142\">In this case, spectroscopic information is obtained by varying the DFB or DBR grating period to tune each individual single-spectral-mode laser <b>1801</b> <i>a/b/c </i>to a different emission wavelength, or by employing broadband sources and varying the resonance wavelength of an RCID <b>1815</b>/<i>a/b/c </i>that measures the intensity of the optical beam transmitted by the extended passive sensing waveguide. When multiple sensors operating at different resonance wavelengths are employed on the same chip, the different sensors can be tuned to wavelengths on and off the spectral fingerprint features of a given chemical, to several representative wavelengths that provide additional spectral details, or to use the same chip for detecting multiple chemical species. Fine-tuning of the sensing element resonance wavelengths can be implemented by locally or globally controlling the temperature on the chip, or by varying the current injected into each given laser source.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0143\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates that in some embodiments, the top of the passive waveguide in the sensing region can be coated by a chemical sorbent <b>1926</b> which can adsorb the molecules of certain classes of chemicals, thereby placing them in the immediate vicinity of the propagating light beam and enhancing their molecular concentration by orders of magnitude. See, e.g., T. H. Stievater et al., \u201cMicromechanical Photothermal Spectroscopy of Trace Gases Using Functionalized Polymers,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>37, 2328 (2012).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0144\">Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>, the passive waveguide in such a case can include a GaSb substrate <b>1904</b>, a n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad layer <b>1905</b>, and a bottom GaSb SCL <b>1906</b>. Sorbent layer <b>1926</b> covers all of the SCL <b>1906</b> and the upper surface of the bottom clad layer <b>1905</b>, with the thickness of the sorbent coating preferably matching the vertical extent of the optical mode propagating in the passive waveguide. As in the other cases described herein, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> and in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or it may proceed only partway through the bottom SCL, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. In addition, although <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a case where the chemical sorbent is deposited on a passive waveguide processed on an ICL chip, in other embodiments the sorbent may be deposited on the passive waveguides on a QCL PIC chip, or on passive silicon waveguides.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0145\">As noted above, the cavity of a highly stable ICL may be configured with gain and saturable absorber sections so that it is passively mode locked and produces short pulses that appear as a frequency comb in the spectral domain, as was recently demonstrated in Bagheri et al. supra. Since the comb stability is often a primary factor limiting the detection sensitivity of dual-comb spectroscopy, it will be advantageous to exploit the greater stability provided by the architectural embodiments of the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0146\">Thus, in some embodiments, both end mirrors of the highly stable frequency comb ICL are defined by HR-coated cleaved facets, and the laser output is obtained via evanescent coupling to a secondary passive waveguide. This is directly analogous to the configurations illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9</figref>, -<b>11</b>, and <b>15</b> for highly stable lasers that are not frequency combs, except that the cavity for the frequency comb laser is divided into gain and saturable absorber sections. As in the case of a highly stable non-frequency-comb laser, the laser cavity in a highly stable frequency-comb laser (ICL or QCL) can also be defined by an etched facet or a DBR mirror at one or both ends of the cavity. The output of such a highly stable frequency comb laser can be emitted from the chip, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, or it may be directed via the passive waveguide to some other region of the chip for functionality in a PIC as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>. For example, one or more highly stable frequency comb ICL(s) may be used as the source(s) for an on-chip chemical sensing system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0148\" num=\"0147\">In particular, two highly stable frequency combs may be employed on the same chip as sources for fully integrated on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy.

Dual-comb spectroscopy is known to offer high spectral resolution over a broad spectral bandwidth, combined with a very short acquisition time on the order of milliseconds. See, e.g., G. Villares et al., \u201cDual-Comb Spectroscopy Based on Quantum-Cascade-Laser Frequency Combs,\u201d <i>Nature Commun. </i>5, 6192 (2014). In dual-comb spectroscopy, information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas is obtained by using a fast detector to observe the multi-heterodyne beating of two frequency combs that have slightly different comb spacings (determined by the cavity length), so as to generate a direct link between the optical and RF domains. The beam from one of the combs interrogates the sample gas, whereas the other comb functions as a local oscillator whose beam does not come into contact with the sample gas. Both transmitted beams then coupled into the same on-chip ICD or QCD, whose output is input to an RF spectrum analyzer. Since a fast detector is required for rapid sensing measurement speed, it is advantageous that both ICDs and QCDs have displayed 3-dB bandwidths of up to 1 GHz and above. See H. Lotfi et al., \u201cHigh-Frequency Operation of a Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade System at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>108, 201101 (2016); and F. R.

Both ends of each laser cavity are highly reflective, e.g., from a combination of HR-coated cleaved facets, HR-coated etched facets, and/or DBR mirrors, although this embodiment does not allow either frequency comb laser to be bounded on both sides by HR-coated cleaved facets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0149\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, each of the frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b </i>(described herein as being ICLs, though QCLs can also be used) evanescently couples to a secondary passive waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>a/b </i>that runs parallel to the active waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, as described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. However, in other embodiments the output from one or both frequency comb ICLs may couple to its corresponding passive waveguide by butt-coupling the passive waveguide to a DBR mirror that defines the output end of the laser cavity. The output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2001</b> <i>a </i>couples to an extended passive sensing waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>a, </i>whose top surface is exposed to ambient to allow evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the ambient sample gas. Absorption by the sample gas then affects the spectral dependence of the light signal reaching the detector following traversal of the extended passive sensing waveguide. The extended passive sensing waveguide, in turn, couples to the input of an on-chip ICD <b>2015</b>. The output from the second highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2001</b> <i>b </i>(the local oscillator) evanescently couples to a second, much shorter passive waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>b </i>that proceeds directly to the same ICD <b>2015</b>. The signal transmitted by the second passive waveguide is not affected significantly by exposure to the sample gas, partly due to its much shorter length, and in some embodiments also because the second passive waveguide is encapsulated so as to prevent its propagating optical mode from coupling to the sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0150\">The two passive waveguides shown in this figure are coupled to the same ICD by a Y-Junction, whose single output passive waveguide butt-couples to the ICD.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0151\">In an alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, the input passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>can evanescently couple to the two sides of an ICD or QCD <b>2115</b> rather than coupling to the detector via a Y-junction as in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>. In still other embodiments, the passive waveguides can be combined by an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) or some other means known to the art before the combined beams are coupled to the ICD or QCD. The combined photocurrent signal measured by the fast ICD due to both transmitted beams is input to an RF spectrum analyzer that determines the multi-heterodyne beating of the two ICL frequency combs with slightly different comb spacings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0152\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, two frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b</i>, each having a gain section <b>2128</b> <i>a/b </i>and a saturable absorber section <b>2129</b> <i>a/b, </i>and each having a slightly different comb spacing, are used. In this embodiment the cavity for each of the two frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b </i>is formed from a waveguide containing curved sections to form a laser cavity terminated at both ends at the same HR-coated cleaved facet <b>2102</b>, by analogy to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> for a single laser, so that the same HR-coated cleaved facet provides both end mirrors for each of the two highly stable frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b</i>. Both lasers can then reside at one end of the chip, while the extended passive sensing waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>a, </i>the shorter passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>b, </i>and the ICD <b>2115</b> can reside at the other end, so as to allow both frequency comb lasers to be mounted epitaxial side down while the extended passive sensing waveguide hangs over the edge of the mount to allow evanescent coupling of its top surface to the ambient sample gas. This configuration has the advantage that the common HR-coated cleaved facet, which provides both end mirrors for both frequency comb lasers, is generally much easier to process with high yield, using standard procedures, than an HR-coated etched mirror or a DBR.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0153\">As in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, in this embodiment, the output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2101</b> <i>a </i>couples to an extended passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>a </i>that evanescently couples to the sample gas, followed by input to the ICD <b>2115</b>. The second highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2101</b> <i>b </i>couples to a passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>b </i>that leads directly to the same ICD <b>2115</b> without interacting with the sample gas, or its interaction is over a very short path length.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0154\">In addition, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, both passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>run parallel to an active waveguide in the ICD for some distance to allow transfer of the input beams to the detector waveguide. As in the case of embodiments where a single input waveguide couples to the detector evanescently, the embodiment that evanescently couples two input waveguides has the advantage of greater laser stability, because much lower fractions of the incoming beams are reflected back into the passive waveguides for unwanted feedback into the two lasers. However, a Y-Junction (as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>) or some other means known to the art may alternatively be used to couple both beams into the same ICD.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0156\" num=\"0155\">In all of the on-chip dual-comb sensing embodiments, such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the extended waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to the sample gas can be coated with a chemical sorbent that concentrates the molecules of interest so as to substantially increase the absorption due to those molecules.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0157\" num=\"0156\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, a DFB ICL seed laser <b>2101</b>-<i>seed </i>provides input to both combs, via passive waveguides <b>2101</b> <i>c/d, </i>to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b </i>that reside on each side of the DFB laser <b>2101</b>-<i>seed</i>. The incorporation of a seed laser such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref> is optional for operation of the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy system of the invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0158\" num=\"0157\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an exemplary PIC embodiment that employs a DFB ICL seed laser <b>2201</b>-<i>seed </i>to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b </i>that reside on each side of the DFB laser <b>2201</b>-<i>seed</i>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref>, similar to the manner described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, both end mirrors for all three lasers are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, although numerous other geometries are possible while maintaining the same inventive design aspects, such as bounding one or both ends of one or more of the laser cavities by DBR or etched mirrors. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref>, two passive waveguides <b>2214</b> <i>a </i>and <b>2214</b> <i>b </i>are evanescently coupled to the active waveguide of the DFB ICL at each end of its cavity. Each of those passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>then couples light from the DFB ICL to each of the frequency comb ICLs <b>2001</b> <i>a/b</i>, which may have the effect of locking them to the DFB emission wavelength, provided that wavelength is sufficiently close to one of the teeth of the frequency combs. The two comb outputs may either be emitted from the chip, e.g., at one of the end facets, or be evanescently coupled into output waveguides <b>2214</b> <i>a/b </i>to be used elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a III-V or silicon PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0159\" num=\"0158\">Other embodiments of III-V PICs designed in accordance with the invention may provide on-chip spectral beam combining to scale the laser power that can be output into a single high-quality beam, as illustrated by the block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 23</figref>. In this embodiment, a QCL or ICL array <b>2331</b> of DFB or DBR lasers is patterned to have slightly different grating pitches so that each laser emits at a slightly different wavelength. The outputs from the lasers in the array can be butt-coupled to passive waveguides <b>2314</b> <i>a/b</i>/ . . . designed and processed in accordance with the invention (e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> in the case of an ICL), with partially-reflecting DBRs. In other embodiments, the refractive index mismatch at the interface between the active and passive waveguides, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>, defines one end mirror for each laser cavity. The outputs from the various array elements emitting at different wavelengths may then be input to an AWG <b>2332</b> for spectral beam combining into a single output waveguide <b>2314</b>-out. The array output with much higher power than each individual array element is then emitted from the chip at a single waveguide aperture <b>2333</b>. Processing protocols for mounting such an array epitaxial side down are well known to the art.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0159\">In some embodiments, the same highly-stable laser cavity evanescently couples to two different passive waveguides. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24A</figref>, the two passive waveguides <b>2414</b> <i>a/b </i>run in parallel to the laser cavity <b>2401</b> for evanescent coupling on the same side of the laser ridge but at opposite ends of the cavity. Alternatively, for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24B</figref> the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at the same end of the cavity, while in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24C</figref> the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at opposite ends of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0160\">In all of these embodiments, both passive waveguides have the same extended length with the same shape, and at the opposite end both couple to ICDs or QCDs integrated on the chip. However, one extended passive waveguide is exposed to the sample gas while the other serves as a reference because it is not exposed. For example, exposure of the reference extended waveguide to the sample gas can be prevented by encapsulating that portion of the chip in a hermetic dome that the sample gas does not penetrate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0161\">All of these embodiments have the advantage of providing a reference signal that propagates through the same length and shape of waveguide for detection by an identical ICD or QCD that nominally operates at the same temperature due to its close proximity on the chip, but which is not attenuated by absorption associated with trace chemicals in the sample gas. The extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>a </i>that is exposed to the sample gas may be covered with a sorbent to enhance the concentration of trace chemicals of interest. In that case, the signal detected for the extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>a </i>coated with the sorbent may be compared to the signal for a reference extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>b </i>that is not coated with the sorbent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0162\">In some embodiments, multi-spectral detection is obtained by positioning multiple in-plane interband or quantum cascade resonant cavity infrared detectors with different resonance wavelengths along a single multi-spectral detection waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0163\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a chemical sensing PIC that integrates on the same III-V or silicon chip a highly stable laser cavity <b>2501</b>, an extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b> whose top surface is exposed to a sample gas, and a series of multi-wavelength RCIDs <b>2515</b> <i>a/b/ </i>. . . that are positioned in series along the same multi-spectral detection waveguide <b>2534</b>, which receives the optical signal transmitted by the extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b>. A DBR mirror <b>2519</b> is positioned on each side of each detector in the multi-spectral series of detectors, with each set of two such DBR mirrors that bound a given RCID is formed by etching gratings with a different pitch than the gratings that form the two DBRs that bound any other RCID in the series, so that each RCID in the series operates at a different resonance wavelength. Preferably, each RCID, consisting of the detector <b>2515</b> and DBR mirrors <b>2519</b>, butt-couples to the next, with no space between the grating for one DBR with a given grating pitch and the grating for the next DBR with a different grating pitch.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0164\">In the case of an ICD RCID, it may be preferable to etch the grating into the passive waveguide structure, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>, rather than into the full waveguide structure as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>. This is because optical loss due to absorption in the active quantum wells can degrade the quality factor of the RCID cavities if the DBRs are formed by etching the grating into the full active structure. The absorption loss in the active quantum wells is of less concern for a QCD RCID, particularly if the DBRs are ion bombarded to trap free carriers and further reduce the loss as discussed above.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0165\">The photocurrent flowing in any given RCID is sensitive primarily to incoming light having a wavelength falling within one linewidth of the resonance wavelength of that RCID, whereas most of the incoming optical signal that does not fall within the narrow spectral linewidth of that RCID is transmitted to the next RCID, since the DBR mirrors do not provide high reflection of any non-resonance wavelength, and the longitudinal length L of the absorber in each RCID is short enough that only a small fraction of the beam is absorbed during a single pass through the absorber. However, most of the spectral component of the incoming optical signal that falls within the narrow spectral linewidth of the given RCID is absorbed, since the quality factor Q of the cavity defined by the two DBRs on each side of the RCID, in combination with the longitudinal pathlength L of the absorber for that RCID, provide high absorption quantum efficiency following multiple longitudinal passes of the selected spectral portion of the beam through the RCID. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25</figref>, the multi-spectral detection waveguide <b>2534</b> terminates at an HR-coated facet <b>2502</b>, or some other broadband mirror that provides a second pass of the optical signal through the multi-spectral series of RCIDs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0166\">Each RCID in the series has a separate top contact that allows the photocurrent generated by the portion of the incoming signal falling within the selected spectral bandwidth of the given RCID to be measured. In some embodiments of a III-V PIC, the circuit is completed by a common ground contact to the substrate side of the chip, which also provides a common ground contact for all the interband or quantum cascade optical emitters on the chip. In the case of a silicon PIC, both contacts to the interband or quantum cascade RCID must be processed on the top side of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0167\">By tuning each RCID to a different resonance wavelength, via the grating pitch of the DBRs surrounding that RCID, the intensity of the incoming signal can be measured as a function of wavelength. Combining the information received from the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series then provides a spectral characterization of the incoming signal. The spectral bandwidths of the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series may be designed to nearly overlap, so that a continuous spectrum can be obtained, or the resonances for the different RCIDs may be selected to detect a pre-determined set of non-contiguous wavelengths of interest.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0168\">If the chemical sensing PIC employs an source with broad spectral bandwidth, such as an infrared light emitting diode (LED) such as the interband cascade LED (see C. S. Kim et al., <i>Opt. Engr. </i>57, 011002 (2018), \u201cImproved Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade Light Emitting Devices\u201d), an infrared amplified spontaneous emission device (e.g., M. C. Zheng et al., Opt. Expr. 23, 2713, \u201cHigh power spiral cavity quantum cascade superluminescent emitter\u201d), or simply an ICL or QCL, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs can be used as the primary means for determining the spectrum for optical transmission through the extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b>. This approach may sometimes be more straightforward to implement than the series of ring resonators that is employed to provide spectral information for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. An advantage of employing a silicon PIC to implement the multi-spectral series of detectors is that DBRs with low loss and high Q may be more straightforward to process with high yield (Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016 supra) than is possible with DBRs processed on a III-V PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0169\">More generally, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs may be used to provide multi-spectral detection of any signal propagating in an incoming passive waveguide. For example, it may be used for multi-spectral or hyper-spectral detection or imaging that on a PIC that does not integrate optical sources on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0170\">Numerous variations on the inventive embodiments described above are possible. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3, 5, and 19</figref> illustrate specific passive and active waveguide configurations that provide evanescent coupling of the beam propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. A variety of alternative designs for both the semiconductor layering design and the passive waveguide profile will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, starting with a QCL III-V epitaxial structure a passive waveguide may be constructed with a bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the bottom InP cladding layer as the bottom clad of the passive waveguide. The InGaAs bottom SCL thickness should be designed for optimal operation of both the highly stable QCL and the passive waveguide. It was mentioned above that ion bombardment of the passive or active waveguide on a QCL chip may deplete the free electrons so as to further reduce the waveguide loss. QCL chips designed for LWIR operation can be used to expand the spectral coverage of III-V PICs incorporating QCLs and QCDs to on-chip chemical sensors probing wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0171\">When the laser output is emitted from the chip (e.g., as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>), the advantageous enhanced stability that is realized when only a small fraction of the power is coupled out of the cavity per pass may be applied to diode lasers operating on any III-V substrate and emitting at any wavelength. This includes near-IR, visible, and ultraviolet diode lasers that may reside on InP, GaAs, GaN, or other III-V substrates, for which passive waveguides may be designed for compatibility with the given laser structure. While a similar enhancement of the laser stability may be induced by applying an HR coating to the output facet defining one end of the laser cavity, the invention&#39;s evanescently-coupled output from the side of the laser cavity provides simpler processing as well as much greater control over the out-coupling fraction per pass (via the double-waveguide profile, the spacer width between the two waveguides, and the distance over which the two waveguides propagate parallel to one another).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0172\">In some embodiments, both ends of the highly stable laser cavity are bounded by HR-coated facets that do not provide any significant spectral selectivity. The two mirrors at opposite ends of the laser cavity may be formed by two facets cleaved on opposite ends of a chip, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, by two mirrors located on the same cleaved facet as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, or by etching an HR-coated facet to form at least one of the mirrors. In the embodiments of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, some fraction of the light is evanescently coupled to a second waveguide that is passive, although in other embodiments the second active waveguide may be active in order to minimize loss (if biased below the gain threshold) or provide further amplification of the optical signal (if biased above the gain threshold).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0173\">In other embodiments, a DBR mirror defines at least one end of the highly stable laser. Some fraction of the light can then couple into a passive or active output waveguide that emerges from the opposite end of the partially-reflecting DBR mirror, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>. Both out-coupling via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide and out-coupling at a DBR mirror provide flexibility in the trade between laser stability and out-coupling efficiency. In the case of evanescent out-coupling to a second waveguide, the fraction of light in the laser cavity that is out-coupled per pass depends on the coupling strength between the two waveguides, which may be varied through adjustment of their separation distance and waveguide profiles. In the alternative case of out-coupling from a partially-reflecting DBR mirror that defines one end of the laser cavity, the etch depth and number of periods may be tuned to adjust the mirror reflectivity. It may be more straightforward to realize a broad range of out-coupling efficiencies when the DBR mirror approach is employed. In terms of positioning it is also more flexible to define the laser cavity by DBR mirrors, since the laser can then be placed anywhere within a PIC, whereas defining the cavity with one or more HR-coated cleaved facets requires that the laser be proximate to one or more boundaries of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0174\">In many embodiments, such as when stable output into a single spectral mode is desired, these two approaches to out-coupling may be used interchangeably. Which is preferable for use in a given PIC may depend in part on whether it is more straightforward to process a DBR or a double waveguide with separation close enough to provide substantial evanescent coupling. In the latter case, the laser cavity must also incorporate a DFB grating or other means of longitudinal mode selection if lasing in a single spectral mode is required. Which architecture is less challenging to fabricate with higher yield will depend in part on the material constituents, and also on the profiles and dimensions of the waveguides. However, in cases where lasing should not occur in a single spectral mode, e.g., when the laser is a frequency comb, a DBR mirror cannot be used to define either end of the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0175\">In some embodiments, the laser source emits in a narrow spectral linewidth due to the implementation of a DFB grating. One or both ends of the cavity are then defined by DBR mirrors or some other means known to the art. In some embodiments, the narrow-linewidth emission wavelength may be tuned over some limited bandwidth by current, temperature, or some other means such as a sampled grating. The spectral bandwidth can be extended by disposing multiple laser sources on the same chip, which are coupled to multiple sensing regions, or by coupling a single laser source to multiple resonant cavities as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. Alternatively, the on-chip IR source may be a broadband emitter such as an LED or ASE source rather than a laser operating with a narrow spectral linewidth.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0176\">The sensing region may consist of an extended passive waveguide, or it may take the form of a ring or other high-Q resonator (or coupled pairs of such resonators) that substantially extend the effective path length for sensing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0177\">The on-chip detector may be an ICD or QCD formed on the same III-V chip from the same epitaxial structure as the laser, or it may be formed from a different III-V, II-VI, or IV-VI active detector material bonded to the same silicon platform as the laser, or it may be an in-plane silicon bolometer processed as part of a silicon PIC. In the case of an ICD or QCD detector, the photocurrent may be collected at zero bias, at a reverse bias, or at a forward bias below the lasing threshold. The latter may be advantageous, for example, to minimize the loss induced by a detector integrated into the laser cavity as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. The absorber region of the detector may be placed within a resonant cavity for operation as a resonant cavity infrared detector by processing DBR mirrors at both ends of the absorber region.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0178\">By combining these options for the MWIR optical source, the sensing region, and the detector, the spectral dependence of the absorption by the sample gas may be determined by tuning the resonance wavelength of the source, the sensing region if it incorporates a resonant cavity, or the detector. If more than one of these operates in a narrow spectral band, the resonance wavelengths must be matched by careful design and calibration, independent temperature tuning of the different regions, or some other means. Spectral information may also be obtained by combining multiple sensors on the same chip, with each operating at a different wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0179\">Many of the embodiments disclosed above apply equally to PICs integrated on either a III-V or silicon substrate, while others are only advantageous when applied to III-V PICs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0180\">Some aspects of the invention may be advantageous even if an entire chemical sensing system is not integrated on the same III-V or silicon chip. For example, one or more highly stable laser sources and passive sensing waveguides in accordance with the invention may be combined on a III-V or silicon chip, in conjunction with coupling into one or more detectors that reside off the chip. Or similarly, one or more off-chip optical sources may be used in conjunction with one or more passive waveguide sensing areas and one or more infrared detectors residing on the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0181\">While the descriptions of the invention as applied to MWIR and LWIR PICs have assumed laser sources based on either type-II GaSb-based ICL structures or InP-based QCL structures, the invention applies equally to other cascade laser structures. These include type-I ICLs that may similarly function as ICDs when operated at zero bias, ICLs grown on InAs substrates, and QCLs grown on GaAs, InAs, GaSb, GaN, or silicon substrates. See, e.g., L.

Lett. </i>103, 121108 (2013).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\">The in-plane waveguides in which the optical signals propagate may be formed entirely within the III-V semiconductor from which the active detector layers are formed, or by depositing or bonding to some other material to form the core and/or clad for a waveguide. For example, chalcogenide materials may be deposited and patterned to form waveguides within a III-V or silicon PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\">Advantages and New Features</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\">A III-V or Si PIC designed for chemical sensing that is based on any of the embodiments described in this invention will be suitable for mass production of hundreds of chemical sensors on the same chip. The individual sensors can then be singulated to form the basis for a package that is both extremely compact and inexpensive.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\">A primary advantage of most of the disclosed embodiments is the high stability of the laser source or multiple laser sources used therein, which is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\">The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\">The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\">Although the present disclosure describes and illustrates various specific embodiments, aspects, and features, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the invention described herein is not limited to only the described embodiments, aspects, and features but also contemplates any and all modifications and alternative embodiments that are within the spirit and scope of the underlying invention described and claimed herein.

No. 16/509,613 filed on Jul. 12, 2019, which in turn is a Nonprovisional of and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/697,419 filed on Jul. 13, 2018. The prior applications and all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference into the present disclosure in their entirety. \\n    \\n    \\n     TECHNICAL FIELD \\n     The present disclosure relates to semiconductor lasers, particularly to edge-emitting semiconductor lasers that are more stable and that can operate with lower drive power than those currently available. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     Instabilities of the output power and/or spectral characteristics of the laser source often limit the performance of optical systems used in such applications as coherent optical communications, length metrology, LIDAR, and spectroscopy-based chemical sensing. See, e.g., B. Tromborg et al., \u201cStability Analysis for a Semiconductor Laser,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  20, 1023 (1984); V. Svedas, \u201cThe Significance of Lidar Pulse Stability in the IR Detection of Hazardous Compounds,\u201d  IEEE Sensors Journal  14, 1391 (2014); and L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMultiheterodyne Spectroscopy Using Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d  Opt. Engr.  57, 011014 (2018). \\n     A major source of instability is feedback from unwanted secondary optical cavities that form due to reflections from one or more surfaces encountered outside the intended primary cavity. The primary cavity of an edge-emitting diode laser is typically defined by coated or uncoated cleaved facets of the laser chip, although mirrors formed by distributed Bragg reflectors, etched facets, or other means may also be employed. While a parasitic secondary cavity may result from feedback within the chip, it is more often due to feedback from an external optic or other surface that is encountered after the beam leaves the output facet of the laser. See S. Takeda and S. Nakagawa, \u201cFeedback Tolerance of DFB Laser for Silicon Photonics Packaging,\u201d  Opt. Expr.  22, 8451 (2014). \\n     Inevitable mechanical and thermal vibrations in a laser device cause the secondary cavity length to vary, which induces temporal \u201cjitter\u201d of the magnitude and spectral characteristics of the secondary lasing modes. Such instabilities in the lasing mode and output power can, for example, seriously degrade the sensitivity of a spectroscopy-based trace chemical measurement as a result of small variations in the laser signal transmitted through a sample gas or liquid. Although an optical isolator can minimize the feedback from external optical elements, the expense, bulk, and wavelength-specificity of such isolators make them unsuitable for incorporation into an ultra-compact chemical sensing system. \\n     The cavity for a conventional narrow-ridge edge-emitting semiconductor laser is most commonly formed by cleaving two high-quality facets that define the two ends of the cavity. Typically, one of the facets (called the back facet) is coated for high reflection (HR), while the light generated within the laser is emitted from the other (front, or output) facet. The output facet may be left uncoated, in which case its reflectivity R is typically 25-40%, or it may be coated to optimize desired figures of merit. For example, the efficiency is generally maximized by applying an anti-reflection (AR) coating that reduces R to a few percent or less, whereas the threshold current density can be minimized by applying a coating with reflectivity higher than that of an uncoated facet (but which nonetheless allows some light to be transmitted to provide the laser output). Other means known to the art may also be employed to form the laser cavity, for example, by etching rather than cleaving one or both facets, or by processing distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. See, e.g., M. Ariga, et al., \u201cLow Threshold GaInAsP Lasers with Semiconductor/Air Distributed Bragg Reflector Fabricated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Etching,\u201d  Jpn. J Appl. Phys.  39, 3406 (2000). \\n     When any of those conventional configurations are employed, the stability of the laser output can be compromised by unwanted feedback from optical elements residing outside the laser cavity. In the case of emission from an end facet, for example, external optical elements may reflect light back into the cavity to provide unwanted time-variant feedback. \\n     In other cases, the laser cavity may be integrated on a chip with other optical components, and some means such as tapers and/or DBR mirrors may be employed to define the cavity, while transferring some fraction of the laser power into a waveguide for use elsewhere in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). \\n     Lasers have been integrated with other optical components to form PICs on III-V and silicon chips, as well as other substrate platforms. While a laser integrated in a PIC and emitting into a waveguide may experience little or no parasitic feedback from external optical elements, it may nonetheless may receive parasitic feedback from downstream optical elements residing elsewhere in the PIC. \\n     PICs operating at telecommunications wavelengths in the near infrared have by now become relatively mature. See C. Zhang and J. E. Bowers, \u201cSilicon photonic terabit/s network-on-chip for datacenter interconnection,\u201d  Optical Fiber Technology  44, 2 (2018)]. On the other hand, PICs operating at longer wavelengths in the extended shortwave infrared (ESWIR, defined here as \u03bb=2-3 \u03bcm), midwave infrared (MWIR, defined here as \u03bb=3-6 \u03bcm), and longwave infrared (LWIR, defined here as \u03bb=6-14 \u03bcm) spectral bands remain in the early stages of development. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,612,398 to Vurgaftman et al., entitled \u201cUltra-Broadband Photonic Integrated Circuit Platform\u201d; see also A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated 2.0 \u03bcm CW Hybrid Silicon Lasers at Room Temperature,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  40, 1480 (2015); A. Spott et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d  Optica  3, 545 (2016) (\u201cSpott,  Optica  2016\u201d); and Y. Zhang et al., \u201cThin-Film Antimonide-Based Photodetectors Integrated on Si,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  54, 4000207 (2018). Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with InAs quantum wells have recently been realized by growing the III-V gain material directly on a silicon chip. See H. Nguyen-Van et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Lasers Grown on Silicon,\u201d  Sci. Reports  8, 7206 (2018). There have been several experimental demonstrations of midwave infrared (MWIR, 2.5-6 \u03bcm) QCLs and interband cascade lasers (ICLs) integrated on silicon. See e.g., &#39;398 patent, supra; see also Spott,  Optica  2016, supra; A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated Distributed Feedback Quantum Cascade Lasers on Silicon,\u201d  Photonics  3, 35 (2016) (\u201cSpott,  Photonics  2016\u201d); A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d IEEE Photonics Conference (1-5 Oct. 2017, Orlando Fla.); and A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d  Optica  5, 996 (2018). \\n     Most of these have been integrated on silicon chips, although the preliminary performance of such integrated devices has been limited in part by the challenge of bonding III-V wafer material to silicon and subsequent processing of the laser ridges from the back. Most often, the optical mode in the gain region of a silicon-based PIC is \u201chybrid,\u201d in that it is shared between the III-V gain material and an underlying silicon waveguide. See Spott,  Photonics  2016, supra. Tapers of the III-V mesa material are then introduced at the boundaries between the hybrid and silicon waveguide sections, in order to adiabatically couple the generated light from one waveguide to the other. However, the performance of these MWIR PICs has been limited in part by inefficient transfer (to date) at the tapers of laser power from the \u201chybrid\u201d III-V/silicon waveguide of the gain region to a passive silicon waveguide that is suitable for coupling the generated laser beam to other optical elements incorporated into a silicon-based PIC. \\n     At shorter wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR), such tapers have provided efficient coupling between the two waveguide sections. See, e.g., C. Zhang, \u201cLow Threshold and High Speed Short Cavity Distributed Feedback Hybrid Silicon Lasers,\u201d  Opt. Expr.  22, 10202 (2014). In those integrated lasers, most of the optical mode in the hybrid waveguide resides in the silicon portion of the waveguide rather than the III-V portion, and so gradual tapering to a silicon waveguide introduces only a relatively minor perturbation of the mode profile. \\n     However, the tapers employed in the integrated QCL and ICL demonstrations to date have induced much more reflection (and in some cases loss) than transmission of the laser beam propagating in the hybrid waveguide. This is probably due in part to the requirement for a much more abrupt evolution of the mode, which in the MWIR devices has been concentrated mostly in the III-V rather than the silicon portion of the hybrid waveguide. This mode distribution has been motivated by a concern that the gain would otherwise not be sufficient to overcome the higher waveguide loss at the longer wavelength, particularly in the case of a QCL that characteristically has relatively low material gain. \\n     A number of demonstrations of interband cascade detectors (ICDs) and quantum cascade detectors (QCDs) have been reported in recent years. These have employed absorber and injector quantum well configurations quite similar to those used in corresponding laser structures that are designed for emission near the detector cut-off wavelength in the case of an ICD, see J. V. Li et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Detectors with Room Temperature Photovoltaic Operation,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  86, 101102 (2005), or near the intersubband resonance wavelength in the case of a QCD, see F. R. Giorgetta, \u201c16.5 \u03bcm Quantum Cascade Detector Using Miniband Transport,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  90, 231111 (2007). \\n     In fact, ICDs have been processed on the same chip with ICLs, see H. Lotfi et al., \u201cMonolithically Integrated Mid-IR Interband Cascade Laser and Photodetector Operating at Room Temperature,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  109, 151111 (2016), and QCDs have been processed on the same chip with QCLs, see B. Schwarz et al., \u201cWatt-Level Continuous-Wave Emission from a Bifunctional Quantum Cascade Laser/Detector,\u201d  ACS Photonics  4, 1225 (2017), using the same multi-stage quantum well wafer material in both cases. ICDs and QCDs are capable of operating at room temperature, which is generally required for chemical sensing via evanescent coupling to a sample gas. It should be noted that neither the laser power nor the detector absorption per unit length needs to be high, since the optical beam generated by the laser can propagate a relatively long distance in the waveguide in the detector section of the chip, to allow spectroscopic detection based on attenuation by the fingerprint absorption features. However, the optical loss in the passive waveguide must be sensitive to absorption by the same gas, rather than being strongly dominated by other parasitic loss mechanisms. \\n     SUMMARY \\n     This summary is intended to introduce, in simplified form, a selection of concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Instead, it is merely presented as a brief overview of the subject matter described and claimed herein. \\n     The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission. \\n     For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors. \\n     In embodiments for which optical output from the laser cavity is required, the invention provides a means for isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF

various forms. The following description shows, by way of illustration, combinations and configurations in which the aspects and features can be put into practice. It is understood that the described aspects, features, and/or embodiments are merely examples, and that one skilled in the art may utilize other aspects, features, and/or embodiments or make structural and functional modifications without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. \\n     The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission. \\n     For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors. \\n     For embodiments in which light is output from the laser cavity, either for emission from the chip or for use elsewhere in a PIC residing on the chip, high laser stability is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n     As described in more detail below, the building blocks needed to construct an on-chip chemical sensor in accordance with the invention include (1) a highly stable laser source, (2) low-loss passive waveguides or actively pumped/amplifying sections to enable interconnections, (3) a passive sensing waveguide with evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid, and (4) an interband or quantum cascade detector. Each of these is described below. \\n     In some embodiments, the top of the waveguide in the sensing region may be coated with a chemical sorbent with a distinct absorption signature that selectively attaches a certain class of chemicals that diffuse into the sorbent from the sample gas. This can significantly enhance the absorption associated with a given concentration of molecules in the sample gas. Such a sensor on a single chip may provide spectroscopic sensing over some range of wavelengths between \u22482.5 \u03bcm and \u22486 \u03bcm when an interband cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip, or over some range of wavelengths between \u22484 \u03bcm and \u224812 \u03bcm when a quantum cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip. When III-V active gain and detector materials are bonded to a silicon chip to form the PIC, sources and detectors operating at any number of MWIR and LWIR wavelengths may in principle be combined on the same chip. \\n     The present invention provides a novel and effective means for strongly suppressing laser instabilities associated with unintended external feedback. By much more effectively isolating the laser cavity on the chip, the invention substantially reduces all interactions with external elements. Although the enhanced laser stability may sometimes be traded against a reduction of the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency, an additional benefit is the potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power required to operate the laser. For some applications these trades may be highly advantageous. \\n     In the case of a III-V PIC, attenuation of the infrared light beam propagating in the passive waveguide is quantified by an ICD or QCD fabricated from the same III-V multi-stage active quantum well structure as the ICL or QCL. Whereas a forward bias is required to produce gain and lasing, an ICD or QCD is typically operated at or near zero bias, although a reverse bias or sub-threshold forward bias may also be applied. \\n     Some embodiments of the present invention obviate the issue of inefficient coupling of the active and passive waveguides at the tapers, by replacing them with a more reliable means for coupling between different waveguide sections. In embodiments of the invention that employ a PIC on a III-V chip, no transfers between hybrid and silicon waveguides are required at all. \\n     These and other features of various embodiments of highly stable lasers and sensors integrated on the same chip are now described with reference to the FIGURES which are filed concurrently herewith and which form a part of the present disclosure. It will be noted that in the FIGURES and in the description below, elements that appear in more than one FIGURE are denoted by the same reference number, with only the first digit being changed to reflect the number of the FIGURE being described. For example, a laser cavity of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention is denoted as \u201claser cavity  101 \u201d when discussed in the context of  FIG. 1  and as \u201claser cavity  601 \u201d when discussed in the context of  FIG. 6 ; similarly, the narrow-ridge laser waveguide is denoted with reference number  103  in  FIG. 1  and with reference number  403  in  FIG. 4 . \\n     A highly stable interband or quantum cascade laser in accordance with the present invention is formed by creating a laser cavity with very weak interactions with any optical elements outside the cavity. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 1  illustrates a simplest embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 1 , such a highly stable laser includes a laser cavity  101  consisting of an ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide  103  bounded by a mirror at each end of the cavity. \\n     In this baseline configuration, the laser experiences no interactions at all with optical elements outside the laser cavity. The laser cavity illustrated in  FIG. 1  is defined by two end facets  102   a / 102   b  that are each coated with a high-reflectivity (HR) metal such as Au, with a dielectric spacer to prevent electrical shorting. In this embodiment, the two end facets are formed by cleaving the wafer from which the cavity is formed. In other embodiments, other highly reflecting end mirrors, such as etched facets with HR coatings or distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), may be employed at one or both ends of the cavity. While \u22480.5 mm represents a practical limit to the minimum cavity length that can be formed with high yield by conventional cleaving methods, shorter cavity lengths are more straightforward if a portion of the waveguide curves such that the mirrors defining both ends of the cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as discussed below, or if the cavity is defined by etching one or both facets or by processing DBRs. \\n     A highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention may be induced to lase in a single spectral mode by first requiring the laser ridge to be narrow enough to support lasing in only a single lateral mode. DBRs may then be used at one or both ends of the laser cavity to select a single longitudinal mode, while in other embodiments, the ridge may be patterned with a distributed feedback (DFB) grating. Since there is no opportunity for feedback from an external optical element to influence operation of the laser, its stability is likely to be determined primarily by the stability of the drive electronics or by thermal fluctuations from the environment (which typically take place on a relatively long time scale). Vibrations should have little effect, since all of the internal lengths are fixed and the reflectors defining the cavity should generally vibrate in unison. \\n     In some embodiments, the laser ridge may be processed on its native III-V chip using conventional fabrication methods, while in other embodiments, it may be integrated on a silicon chip by growing the III-V active gain material on silicon or by growing on the native III-V substrate and then bonding to silicon as discussed above. Processing on the native III-V chip rather than silicon is generally more straightforward and less expensive, and is likely to produce higher yield. \\n     Of course, a laser having no interaction at all with anything outside its own cavity cannot perform any useful function. However, interaction can be obtained without introducing any potential for feedback from external optical elements by evanescently coupling some or all of the laser&#39;s ridge waveguide to an ambient sample gas or liquid. \\n     In all of the embodiments of the invention described below, a common bottom contact on the substrate of the ICL or QCL wafer is employed, although embodiments with both contacts made to the top of the wafer may also employ the same inventive aspects. A substantial fraction of the optical mode resides in the top and bottom n \u2212 -GaSb separate confinement layers (SCLs), which exhibit low loss and high refractive index. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 2  illustrates a typical cross section for a conventional ICL narrow-ridge waveguide that is formed by processing ICL wafer material which is typically grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In preferred embodiments, the sidewalls of the ridge waveguide of the narrow-ridge ICL are etched to below the active stages to prevent current spreading in the wafer. \\n     The conventional narrow-ridge waveguide shown in  FIG. 2  is formed by processing ICL wafer material that includes an n + -GaSb substrate  204  with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  205  on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL)  206  on an upper surface of bottom clad  205 , active ICL gain stages  207  on an upper surface of SCL  206 , a top GaSb SCL  208  on an upper surface of the active gain stages, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad  209  on an upper surface of top SCL  208 , and a thin n + -InAs or n + -InAsSb top contact layer  210  on an upper surface of top clad  209 . A layer of a dielectric  211  such as SiN is deposited on the ridge sidewalls, followed by metallization on top of the ridge to provide a top electrical contact  212 . The bottom contact (not shown) is usually made to n + -GaSb substrate  204 . The arrows in  FIG. 2  indicate the direction of current flow when a forward bias is applied to produce gain for lasing. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 3  illustrates the cross section for an exemplary embodiment of an alternative ICL ridge waveguide that is modified such that part of the top SCL is exposed to ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , such an alternative ICL ridge waveguide, like the conventional waveguide described above with respect to  FIG. 2 , includes an n + -GaSb substrate  304  with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  305  on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL)  306  on an upper surface of bottom clad  305 , active ICL gain stages  307  on an upper surface of SCL  306 , a top GaSb SCL  308  on an upper surface of the active gain stages  307 , an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad  309  on an upper surface of top SCL  308 , and a thin n + -InAs or n + -InAsSb top contact layer  310  on an upper surface of top clad  309 . After the narrow-ridge waveguide has been etched, a dielectric layer  311  is deposited on the sidewalls to prevent electrical shorting and metal is deposited to form a top contact  312 . \\n     Unlike the conventional waveguide shown in  FIG. 2 , in the waveguide in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in  FIG. 3 , one sidewall of the active ICL stages  307 , the top SCL  308 , and top clad  309 , as well as a portion of bottom SCL  306  are exposed to permit coupling of the lasing mode to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The lasing threshold, slope efficiency, and maximum output power then provide information about whether the ambient sample gas contains any trace chemicals with absorption features at the laser wavelength. \\n     Numerous variations of this exemplary embodiment will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, in some variations, a double ridge may be formed to provide weak index guiding of the lasing mode, with the inner ridge etched to a depth above the active stages and the outer ridge etched to below the active stages. In other cases, ion bombardment can optionally be used to prevent current spreading into the outer ridge, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cWeakly Index-Guided Interband Cascade Lasers with No Grown Top Cladding Layer or a Thin Top Cladding Layer.\u201d As noted above, by depositing the dielectric and top contact metallization on only part of the ridge, the rest can remain exposed to ambient. In still other cases, a DFB grating may also be patterned into the ridge, e.g., by etching into the III-V material or by depositing Ge and patterning the grating in the Ge. See &#39;571 patent, supra. \\n     A closely analogous embodiment can be constructed using QCL gain stages for the highly stable laser rather than ICL gain stages. For the well-known case of an InP-based QCL, the substrate is InP, the active stages typically employ strain-compensated InGaAs\u2014InAlAs quantum wells, the top and bottom cladding layers are typically n-InP, and a top and/or bottom InGaAs SCL may optionally be incorporated to maximize overlap of the optical mode with the sample gas surrounding the laser. Numerous other variations of the ridge geometry and material constituents will be obvious to one skilled in the art, and all such variations are deemed to be within the scope of the present disclosure. \\n     QCLs can operate with high performance extending from MWIR wavelengths of 4 \u03bcm or shorter to LWIR wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm, and all of the embodiments of the invention discussed below that pertain to ICLs and/or ICDs apply equally to QCLs and/or QCDs operating at both MWIR and LWIR wavelengths. \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 4A and 4B  illustrate aspects of an exemplary embodiment of a highly stable laser that provides evanescent coupling of the laser beam propagating in the cavity to a sample gas or liquid. \\n     As seen in  FIG. 4A , a highly stable laser in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention includes a laser cavity  401  that is divided longitudinally into active and passive sections  413  and  414 , respectively, where the active waveguide section includes a narrow-ridge waveguide  403 . At each end of the laser cavity is an HR-coated cleaved facet  402   a / 402   b . In other embodiments, high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to an ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. \\n       FIG. 4B  illustrates an exemplary configuration of the boundary between the active ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide section and the passive waveguide section of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. While an additional reflection will occur at the boundary between the active and passive waveguide sections, due to mismatch of the modal profiles in the two sections, generally this should not seriously degrade the spectral mode selectivity. \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 4B , such an exemplary waveguide structure includes the components previously described above with respect to  FIG. 2 , including a bottom SCL  406 , ICL (or QCL) active gain stages  407 , top SCL  408 , top clad  409 , and a thin top contact layer (not shown). The active narrow-ridge waveguide shown in  FIG. 4B  further includes a dielectric layer  411  on the sidewalls of the active narrow-ridge waveguide and a top metal contact layer  412  disposed on an upper surface of the top contact layer. At the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide is preferably HR-coated with a dielectric insulator and metal so that light which would otherwise be emitted into the ambient above the passive waveguide is reflected back into the laser cavity. \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 5A and 5B  illustrate two exemplary cross-sections of a low-loss passive waveguide section in a highly stable semiconductor laser in accordance with the present invention. These passive waveguides are formed on the same chip using the same ICL wafer material as is used for the active waveguides, with either an active or passive waveguide selected by changing the etching and other processing of a given region of the chip. \\n     As can be seen in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , in exemplary embodiments, each of these passive waveguides includes an n + -GaSb substrate  504 , an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad  505 , and a bottom GaSb SCL  506 , though other materials (superlattice or bulk materials) can be used as appropriate. The ridge for each of these passive waveguides is formed by etching away the heavily-doped top contacting layer, the top cladding layer, the top SCL, and the active gain stages, with the etch stopping near the top of the bottom SCL  506 , to provide an air top clad for the waveguide. In these embodiments, the ICL waveguide may be redesigned so that the bottom SCL is thicker than the top SCL, which can be done with only a modest reduction of the optical confinement factor for the lasing mode in the ICL. In addition, in order to avoid parasitic emission into the air above the passive waveguide due to the height and modal profile differences between the active and passive waveguides at the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide should preferably be HR coated at the interface between the active and passive waveguides. \\n     In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 5A , part of the InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer  505  is also removed laterally outside the ridge, with the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stopping near the top of InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer  505 . Alternatively, in the embodiment shown in  FIG. 5B , the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stops within the bottom SCL  506 . \\n     In both cases, the air top clad of the passive waveguide in accordance with the present invention is suitable for evanescently coupling the optical mode propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. The beam propagates in the ridge waveguide formed by the bottom n \u2212 -GaSb SCL  506  as its core, the bottom superlattice cladding layer  505  (along with a portion of bottom SCL in the embodiment of  FIG. 5B ) as its bottom clad, and air as its top clad. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the sample gas or liquid. DFB gratings may be added in the active waveguide section of the cavity in a manner described below, or spectral mode selectivity may be imposed by processing DBR gratings at one or both ends of the cavity, rather than by terminating both ends of the cavity by cleaved facets with HR coatings. In either embodiment, the layer thicknesses, waveguide widths, and etch depths must be designed such that light propagating through the passive waveguide can be optically confined. In addition, in both embodiments, the tops and sides of the waveguide are suitable for evanescently coupling the propagating light to an ambient sample gas or liquid. \\n     In other cases, a structure analogous to the one shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B  can be used to construct a highly stable QCL in which the passive waveguide section is formed using a thick bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the InP lower cladding layer of the laser as the clad. \\n     Numerous variations on the waveguide geometry and material constituents for this passive waveguide will be obvious to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide sections can be made relatively long, e.g., as long as 1 cm or more, to enhance the chemical detection sensitivity, since in most cases the passive waveguide loss will be low and absorption by the sample gas weak unless the chemical species of interest is present with a high concentration. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide extending from the gain region to the end of the cavity may follow a straight path. In other embodiments, it may follow a winding path that provides the same total passive waveguide length with greater compactness on the chip. In some embodiments, the winding or curved path of the passive waveguide may terminate at a mirror provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet as the mirror at the other end of the cavity. Embodiments in which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by termination at the same HR-coated cleaved facet will be discussed further below. \\n     The spectral characteristics of the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity are modified by the presence or absence of a chemical species of interest. As a result, a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention can be incorporated into a sensor to detect the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas incident on the sensor, where the presence of the gas is detected through changes in the threshold current, slope efficiency, and/or power of the highly stable laser operating in the cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas can be detected by monitoring the compliance voltage in the I-V characteristics of the highly stable laser when a constant current is injected. See M. C. Phillips et al., \u201cIntracavity Sensing via Compliance Voltage in an External Cavity Quantum Cascade Laser,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  37, 2664 (2012). When the loss due to absorption of the laser beam by the sample gas increases, the lasing threshold increases and the radiative recombination rate decreases at a given current injection level above threshold. Therefore, a higher voltage must be applied to maintain the same current. Phillips et al., supra, observed a 0.15 V increase of the compliance voltage for a QCL emitting near 7.7 \u03bcm when the laser wavelength was swept across an absorption line of water vapor. In that experiment, the sample gas resided in an external region of the laser cavity (which also provided tuning of the laser wavelength), rather than being evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in a passive waveguide. \\n     Without an external cavity to tune the wavelength, the present invention can sweep across the absorption resonance by current or temperature tuning, where the dependence of compliance voltage on current is compared to that observed when the chemical species of interest is not present in the sample gas or liquid. In other embodiments, different lasers on the same chip can be tuned to different DFB or DBR wavelengths to provide a reference. \\n     The compliance voltage method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas may be combined with either evanescent coupling within the gain region, as in the case shown in  FIG. 1  with an active waveguide cross section such as that shown in  FIG. 3 , or when the waveguide in the laser cavity is divided into active and passive sections as shown in  FIG. 4A . \\n     For the case of an ICL, the passive waveguide could have a cross section such as that shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B . Measurement of the compliance voltage to monitor absorption by the sample gas can be applied either to ICLs or, as in the experiment reported by Phillips et al., to QCLs. \\n     A second method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas of a laser beam propagating within a highly stable laser cavity is to incorporate an additional detector waveguide section into the laser cavity. \\n     This is shown schematically in  FIG. 6 . Thus, a sensor in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 6  includes a laser cavity  601  having HR-coated end facets  602   a / 602   b , although in other embodiments high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The laser cavity contains a detector waveguide section  615  on one side of an active gain waveguide  613 , with a passive sensing waveguide  614  section on the other side of the active gain waveguide, where the top surface of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating optical mode to a sample gas or liquid as in the discussion above. In other embodiments, the detector waveguide section and the sensing waveguide section may be positioned on the same side of the active gain waveguide, rather than on opposite sides. The photocurrent measured by the detector, which may be an ICD or QCD, depends on the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity. The lasing wavelength can be tuned by varying the operating temperature, by varying the current flowing through the active gain waveguide, or by other means; in such cases, the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity will depend on the spectral characteristics of the absorption of the optical mode due to its evanescent coupling to the sample gas in the sensing waveguide section. The photocurrent measured by the detector will then provide information about the spectral characteristics of the absorption by the sample gas. \\n     In other embodiments, the detector may also be placed inside the laser cavity when evanescent coupling to the sample gas occurs within the active gain section, as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 3 . In such cases, the laser cavity includes an active gain waveguide section and a detector waveguide section, but no separate passive waveguide section. The active gain waveguide section and detector waveguide section must be separately contacted, with a gap in between to prevent crosstalk between the two sections. In some embodiments, a DBR may be positioned between the gain and detector sections of the waveguide to reduce the loss of the laser cavity. The DBR can cause the laser to operate in a single spectral mode, preferably with the detector waveguide extending beyond its absorption length before another reflecting element is encountered. Alternatively, if a second DBR is placed at the other end of the detector waveguide, the detector can be made to function as a resonant cavity IR detector (RCID) with the same resonance wavelength as the laser. See U.S. Pat. No. 10,297,699 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cIn-Plane Resonant-Cavity Infrared Photodetectors with Fully-Depleted Absorbers.\u201d The opposite end of the laser cavity can be defined by an additional DBR, or by a broadband HR mirror such as a coated cleaved facet. \\n     As noted above, both ICLs and QCLs may be operated as detectors if zero bias, a reverse bias, or a sub-threshold forward bias is applied rather than the above-threshold forward bias needed to produce lasing, with the resulting photocurrent being monitored to quantify the strength of the propagating optical signal. See Li et al., supra, and Giorgetta et al. (2007), supra. \\n     In the example of an ICL operated under forward bias to produce gain, the electron injector with chirped quantum well thicknesses transfers electrons from the semimetallic interface to the active electron quantum wells, where they recombine with holes in the active hole quantum well. In an ICD, however, electrons that are photoexcited in the active quantum wells of a given stage flow \u201cdownhill\u201d through the electron injector toward the semimetallic interface, where they recombine with photoexcited holes from the next stage. Thus, whereas a single electron injected electrically into an N-stage ICL can produce N photons, an ICD requires N photons to transfer a single electron across all the stages to provide photocurrent. The cut-off wavelength of the ICD is roughly equal to the emission wavelength of the ICL, since both are determined by the bandgap of the active quantum wells and that bandgap does not change substantially with the application of a forward or reverse bias. Whereas the photocurrent must compete with the noise induced by thermally-generated electrons that traverse the same path, a very high detectivity is not required because the detector residing inside the laser cavity experiences a high photon flux. \\n     However, the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity must be short enough that loss associated with absorption of the lasing photons does not seriously degrade the laser performance. To minimize the loss, it may be advantageous to apply a sub-threshold forward bias to the detector waveguide section of the cavity, which will lower the loss in the cavity while still allowing photocurrent to be generated. The advantage of lower loss must be weighed against the disadvantage that the detector noise current will be higher when a sub-threshold forward bias is applied. It may, in fact, be beneficial to monitor the detector response as a function of sub-threshold bias current. \\n     The operation of a quantum cascade detector is quite similar, except that intersubband absorption then provides photocurrent across the active stages when a reverse, zero, or sub-threshold forward bias is applied to the structure. In the case of a QCD, the maximum absorption in the detector waveguide section occurs at a wavelength that is noticeably longer than the same structure&#39;s QCL emission wavelength, since before absorption the electrons in thermal equilibrium or quasi-thermal equilibrium reside primarily in a subband that is about two optical phonon energies lower than the subband corresponding to the lower lasing level. The role of the lower subband is to ensure rapid depopulation of the lower lasing level following stimulated emission. In spite of this mismatch, the higher subband that contributes to absorption at the emission wavelength is sufficiently populated at room temperature for the absorption coefficient to reach several cm \u22121 , according to simulations by the inventors. In many cases this will be sufficient to allow the light intensity propagating in the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity to be monitored. \\n     The spectral dependence of the highly stable laser intensity in the presence of evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid can be determined by tuning the laser wavelength with current or temperature, by using a sampled grating to increase the tuning range, see S. Kim, \u201cDesign and Analysis of Widely Tunable Sampled Grating DFB Laser Diode Integrated With Sampled Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector,\u201d  IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett.  16, 15 (2004), or by placing multiple lasers with slightly different operating wavelengths (e.g., tuned by varying the DFB or DBR grating pitch) on the same chip. \\n     The emitter areas of a sensing chip employing any of these embodiments will be suitable for gold electro-plating above the contact metallization, to enhance the thermal dissipation for better laser and detector performance. In the case of intra-cavity evanescent coupling to the sample gas via an exposed sidewall of the laser ridge, as illustrated in  FIG. 3 , epitaxial-side-down mounting for further enhancement of the thermal dissipation will be possible only if the processing provides an air pocket that allows the sample gas access to the exposed sidewall of the ridge. Since it may be quite challenging to incorporate such an air pocket, it will be more straightforward to apply epitaxial-side-down mounting to the emitter areas of embodiments that provide evanescent coupling to the sample gas via a passive waveguide section of the laser cavity, as in the embodiments shown in  FIGS. 4 and 6 . \\n     The block schematics in  FIGS. 7A and 7B  illustrate an exemplary embodiment in which this is accomplished by flip-chip bonding the active gain region of the laser cavity to a heat sink, while leaving the passive sensing waveguide section hanging over the edge of the heat sink to provide access to the sample gas. Thus,  FIG. 7A  shows a single chip  716  containing multiple highly stable laser cavities  701   a / 701   b , etc, each comprising active gain waveguide and passive sensing waveguide sections  713  and  714 , where the chip can be mounted epitaxial-side-down on a patterned heat sink submount  717 . After epitaxial-side-down mounting on the patterned submount, as illustrated in  FIG. 7B , the passive sensing waveguide sections of all the laser cavities extend over the edge of the submount to provide exposure of the passive sensing waveguide sections to the ambient sample gas. \\n       FIGS. 7A and 7B  also illustrate that the active gain waveguide sections of multiple lasers on the same chip can be epitaxial-side-down mounted in this manner, as long as they are all at the same end of the chip and the passive sensing waveguide sections at the other end of the chip can all be exposed over the edge of the mount. It may be more straightforward to mount multiple lasers on the chip epitaxial side down, while another portion of the chip hangs over the edge of the thermal mount to allow access to an ambient sample gas, when both ends of all the laser cavities terminate at the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as will be discussed below. \\n     In some embodiments of the invention, output from the highly-stable laser is coupled into a passive waveguide, e.g., such as that shown in  FIG. 5  for the case of an ICL PIC, for chemical sensing or some other functionality elsewhere on the PIC. In some of these embodiments, the mirror at one or both ends of the highly-stable laser cavity is formed by butt-coupling the active and passive waveguides as shown in  FIG. 4B . Due to the mismatch of the modal refractive index at the interface between the two waveguide sections, part of the beam is reflected back into the laser cavity to provide feedback. \\n     As discussed above, a dominant contribution to the instability of semiconductor lasers is often unwanted feedback from external optical elements. This effect can be especially strong in the case of a conventional edge-emitting configuration in which the output facet of the cleaved cavity is either AR coated (reflectivity R\u22642%) or uncoated (typically R\u224825-40%). In both cases, a significant fraction of the light that is returned to the facet following reflection by an external element is transmitted back into the cavity. Therefore, suppressing the feedback from external elements can lead to a substantial enhancement of the laser stability. \\n     One approach to reducing the external feedback is to increase the reflectivity of the output facet to as high as about 90%. In applying this approach as well as the other embodiments discussed below, there is a trade-off between degraded stability when the reflectivity is low against lower maximum output power and efficiency when it is high. A further consideration is that the internal laser operation is more efficient when the mirrors at both ends of the cavity have high reflectivity. The cavity can then be shortened without causing excessive mirror loss, which provides a potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power. The most straightforward approach to increasing the reflectivity at a facet while still allowing output is to deposit a multi-layer Bragg dielectric coating. However, such coatings can be expensive and challenging to apply, especially at longer wavelengths where each layer becomes proportionally thicker. \\n     An alternative approach to increasing the reflectivity of an output mirror is to use a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror rather than a cleaved facet to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 8A  illustrates an exemplary first- or third-order DBR mirror  819  that defines one end of a highly stable ICL cavity having the layer structure described above with respect to  FIG. 2 . \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 8A , the etch for the DBR preferably stops just above the active ICL gain stages  807 , which means that current spreading into those stages can minimize loss in the DBR section of the waveguide that does not have a top contact to provide current injection. Whereas the current injected into a conventional diode laser spreads a few microns at most, it is known that the current injected into an ICL or QCL typically spreads laterally by &gt;100 \u03bcm. See Forouhar et al., \u201cReliable Mid-Infrared Laterally-Coupled Distributed-Feedback Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  105, 051110 (2014); see also U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571, supra. Due to limitations of the practical etch depth and sidewall angle that can be achieved routinely for a given grating period when GaSb-based laser structures are processed with reactive ion etching, the processing yield is likely to be higher if a third-order grating is employed rather than a first-order grating. For the case of an exemplary ICL emitting at 3.5 \u03bcm, the grating period is then roughly 1.5 \u03bcm, and it is preferable that the grating comprise &gt;100 periods if high reflectivity is desired. An analogous DBR mirror can similarly be patterned into QCL structures. In the case of a InP- or GaAs-based QCL emitting at a wavelength beyond 4 nm, it may be practical to employ a first-order rather than third-order grating, since those material systems are less challenging to etch with steep sidewall angles, and the period also scales wavelength. \\n     The reflectivity of the DBR mirror can be tuned to a desired value by varying the grating length (number of periods) or the etch depth, to produce the desired trade-off between laser stability and laser power. For maximum reflection by a mirror that is not intended for output, a simulation by the inventors of the ICL structure shown in  FIG. 8A  indicates that a grating length of at least 100 \u03bcm is preferred, which with an etch depth of 1.1 \u03bcm is projected to produce a reflectivity of \u224890%. Whereas a longer grating would provide higher reflectivity, there is a limit to how far current injected from the top metal contact will spread into the DBR. Any unpumped outer portion of the DBR that does not receive very much current will be lossy, although this loss will be mitigated somewhat by self-pumping from the laser light reaching those portions of the DBR. Any loss that results will limit the maximum attainable mirror reflectivity. In some embodiments, the etched notches between the DBR teeth can be filled with a dielectric such as SiN, with a metal contact applied to the top of the DBR teeth so that current can be injected into the active stages of the DBR section of the waveguide to minimize the loss. In other embodiments, a dielectric such as SiN can be deposited over the entire top of the DBR, so that metal can be deposited on top of the dielectric for epitaxial-side-down mounting. In any embodiment for which a dielectric fills the notches in the DBR, the grating pitch must naturally be adjusted so as to account for the altered modal refractive index in the DBR section of the waveguide. \\n     When a DBR is used as the output mirror, its reflectivity can be adjusted for optimal trade-off between laser stability and maximum laser power, as discussed above. The beam from an ICL that includes such a DBR can be output to a passive waveguide section that begins just beyond the final DBR period. This passive waveguide can then be directed elsewhere on the chip for use in a PIC, or to an output facet for emission from the chip. In the latter case, feedback from the chip&#39;s output facet should be minimized by depositing an AR coating, and possibly also tilting the passive waveguide with respect to the output facet. When the III-V laser is integrated on a silicon PIC platform, it is relatively straightforward to provide a DBR by pre-patterning it into the silicon before the active III-V gain material is bonded and processed. See Spott,  Photonics  2016, supra. \\n     In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 8B , the DBR is formed in a passive waveguide structure such as that illustrated in  FIG. 5 , rather than in the full active waveguide as shown in  FIG. 8A . The grating is then etched into the passive waveguide to a depth stopping within the bottom SCL layer  806  or the bottom cladding layer  805 . While there will be a greater mismatch of the mode in the laser&#39;s narrow ridge waveguide  803  and that in the passive waveguide of the DBR  819 , an advantage for some configurations is a lower loss due to removal of the active quantum wells. This may be more important in the case of an ICL rather than QCL PIC, since in the absence of a forward bias the active quantum wells in an ICL display higher optical loss. \\n     In other embodiments of the invention, feedback from optical elements external to the laser cavity (residing either external to the chip or elsewhere on the chip if the laser is integrated into a PIC) is reduced to enhance the laser stability by extracting light via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide that runs parallel to the primary active gain waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, rather than the conventional extraction of light at a partially-transmissive end mirror (or alternatively, by using a second-order diffraction grating to emit light out of the plane). \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 9  shows a cross-section of one embodiment for the two parallel waveguides at the HR-coated facet. As illustrated in  FIG. 9 , active gain waveguide  903  includes a bottom SCL section  906   a , an insulating film section  911   a  and top SCL section  908 , and further includes active ICL stages  907 , top clad  909 , and a top n +  contact layer (not shown), whereas passive waveguide  914  includes only a bottom SCL section  906   b  and dielectric insulating layer  911   b  on the top and sides without a top clad or active gain stages because those were etched away from the passive waveguide during the processing. Both the active and passive waveguides are coated with a top metal contact layer  912 . The preferred separation between the two waveguides is \u2248300 nm to \u22482 \u03bcm, and the space between them is filled with a layer  911   b  of a dielectric that has low loss at the emission wavelength, such as SiN in the case of the ICLs. The etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 9  and in  FIG. 5A , or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . The entire top of this section of the passive waveguide is covered by the insulating dielectric  911   b  to minimize loss due to overlap of the optical mode with the top metal  912  that is deposited to provide a top contact and to enhance the extraction of heat from the active laser ridge. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 10  illustrates another embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 10 , light from a laser cavity  1001  is extracted from the highly stable laser via evanescent coupling of the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1003  to a second (passive) waveguide  1014  that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1003  over some portion of the laser cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, the light coupled into the passive waveguide propagates to a third facet  1002   c , which is cleaved orthogonally to the two facets that define opposite ends of the laser cavity, with the light emitted from the chip via the third facet. \\n     Once a desired fraction of the beam has been coupled into the passive waveguide  1014 , it angles away from primary active waveguide  1003  and is directed either toward a facet  1002   c  for emission from the chip as output  1021  (as shown in the FIGURE), or elsewhere on the chip for functionality within a PIC (not shown). In the former case, the facet at which light is emitted may be AR coated, and/or the passive waveguide may intersect the facet at a sufficiently large angle with respect to normal, as shown in the figure, that reflection at the emission facet is minimized. Reflection at the emission facet  1002   c  would reduce the output power, and also couple reflected light back into the laser cavity  1001 . \\n     To provide single-mode operation of the highly stable laser, in some embodiments, a DFB grating may be fabricated in the active waveguide of the laser cavity, while in other embodiments, the cavity may be bounded by high-reflectivity DBRs rather than HR-coated facets. \\n     In still other embodiments, the highly stable laser may also be configured as an interband cascade laser (ICL) frequency comb. See Bagheri et al., \u201cPassively mode-locked interband cascade optical frequency combs,\u201d  Sci. Reports  8, 3322 (2018), which was co-authored by some of the inventors of the present invention. In such embodiments, the laser cavity is divided into two separately-contacted sections, where one section provides gain while the other serves as a saturable absorber (SA). The SA section may be ion bombarded to shorten the carrier lifetime for faster recovery of the absorption condition, and a reverse bias may also be applied to further shorten the lifetime. That configuration can provide passive mode locking, with emission in a pulse length shorter than 1 picosecond. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 11  illustrates an alternative embodiment of a highly stable laser in which light is extracted via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide  1114  that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide  1103  over some section of the laser cavity. In this embodiment, the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet. Apart from the paths followed, the geometries of the active and passive waveguides may be the same as for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 10 . In embodiments for which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as in  FIG. 11 , the bending radius should preferably be large enough that bending loss remains a small fraction of the net waveguide loss. Again, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL. \\n     The active waveguide that forms the cavity of the highly stable laser may be straight, and connect two HR-coated cleaved facets, as shown in  FIG. 10 , or it may be curved such that both end mirrors are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as shown in  FIG. 11 . In both cases, gold electroplating may be applied to the active waveguide to improve heat dissipation, which optionally may be followed by epitaxial-side-down mounting to a substrate or other mount. In addition, in both cases, the output beam propagating in the passive waveguide can be directed to a facet for emission from the chip as output  1021 / 1121 , as shown in the FIGURES, or it may be directed to some other region of a PIC for on-chip chemical sensing or some other function. Although  FIGS. 10 and 11  show the output waveguide that evanescently couples to the primary waveguide of the laser cavity to be a passive waveguide, in other cases, the output waveguide may be an active waveguide that maintains the active gain stages, top SCL, top clad, and top contact layer. \\n     In the case of a highly stable QCL, the loss in the full gain region without a bias is relatively low, so the passive waveguide may optionally comprise the entire QCL structure with the same processing, ridge width, and etch depth(s) used to form the narrow ridge of the passive waveguide as was used to form the narrow ridge of the active waveguide, except that no dielectric is needed on the sidewalls, no metal is deposited on top for contacting, and no bias is applied. The loss in the passive QCL waveguide may be reduced further by ion bombardment. See U.S. Pat. No. 9,450,053 to Anish Goyal et al., entitled \u201cPhotonic Integrated Circuits Based On Quantum Cascade Structures.\u201d However, in the case of a highly stable ICL, the loss in the output waveguide will be quite high if the entire ICL gain structure is retained. Therefore, the active stages should be etched away as discussed above to form a low-loss passive waveguide such as those shown in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B , or the entire ICL structure should be retained, including a top contact which provides a forward bias at a level high enough to reduce the loss to an acceptable level. Alternatively, an output waveguide comprising the full QCL or ICL structure can be contacted and biased above threshold to provide further amplification of the laser signal. \\n     The strength of coupling between the primary and secondary waveguides may be tuned by varying the separation distance between the two waveguides, the depth of the etch in the region separating them, and/or the length over which they run in parallel. A broad range of net coupling strengths can be induced by varying one or more of these design parameters. The net coupling strength will govern the trade-off between laser stability (maximized when the coupling is weak) and maximum output power and efficiency (maximized when the coupling is strong). The maximum coupling is obtained when the region separating the active and passive waveguides is not etched at all. The inventors have simulated the coupling between active and passive waveguides, similar to those illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 5A , respectively, corresponding to a typical design for an ICL emitting at a wavelength around 3.5 \u03bcm. If both waveguides are 5 \u03bcm wide and separated by 500 nm, with no etch of the region separating them, the simulation predicts that a maximum of \u224827% of the light can be transferred from the active to the passive waveguide, which occurs over a coupling length of \u224819 \u03bcm along the longitudinal axis. \\n     In other embodiments, a highly stable laser may generate gain in a hybrid III-V/silicon waveguide processed on a silicon platform. \\n     The block schematic in  FIGS. 12A-12C  illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a coupling approach that is projected to transfer the beam more efficiently while maintaining highly stable laser operation. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 12 , QCL or ICL gain material is heterogeneously bonded to a pre-processed silicon platform to form a laser cavity with a hybrid narrow-ridge waveguide. See Spott,  Optica  2016, supra. Preferably, both ends of the laser cavity are bounded by high-reflectivity mirrors. In some embodiments, one or both high-reflectivity mirrors may be an HR-coated facet. In other embodiments, such as that shown in  FIG. 12 , the III-V ridge extends beyond both ends of the laser cavity, which is bounded and defined by two DBR mirrors  1222   a  and  1222   b  which are patterned into the silicon before the III-V gain material is bonded thereto, where the DBR mirrors preferably induce nearly 100% reflectivity in the laser cavity. \\n     The lasing mode resides primarily in a first III-V/silicon hybrid waveguide  1223   a , whose silicon portion is a narrow ridge that was pre-patterned in the silicon platform before the two materials were heterogeneously bonded. Following the heterogeneous bonding, the narrow silicon ridge lies underneath the III-V ridge. It is narrower than the III-V ridge, and extends along the entire laser cavity (and beyond) along a straight path. In addition, a second pre-processed silicon waveguide  1223   b , which is also narrower than the III-V ridge is laterally separated from the first narrow silicon ridge by some distance and runs parallel to the first silicon waveguide  1223   a  along some portion of the laser cavity, but at some point begins to follow an angular trajectory that finally exits the III-V mesa and the laser cavity. The second silicon waveguide  1223   b  extends well beyond the DBR mirror  1222   a  at a first end of the gain cavity to provide loss outside the gain cavity without inducing any parasitic reflections that can feed light back into the laser cavity. Once it has completely emerged from the III-V mesa, the second silicon waveguide  1223   b  is a passive waveguide that provides the output of light from the integrated QCL or ICL in the form of a passive waveguide  1214 . The output light can either be emitted from the chip, or directed elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a PIC. \\n     This structure also avoids many of the processing challenges that occur when tapers are introduced to transfer the mode between active and passive waveguides, as well as optical losses that can occur at the tapers. Furthermore, highly reflecting DBRs are straightforward to pattern in the silicon waveguide before the III-V gain material is bonded. \\n     As in some of the embodiments discussed previously, there will be a trade-off between higher laser stability when the coupling to the emission silicon waveguide is weak, and higher power transferred to that waveguide when it is stronger. The coupling strength of the emission silicon waveguide to the lasing mode can be controlled by how close its straight portion (to the left in  FIG. 12A ) is to the center of the optical mode profile that nominally corresponds to the middle of the III-V active mesa, as well by the length of the straight section. This straight portion precedes its angular section that leads to its departure from the laser cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, silicon waveguide  1223   a  may be eliminated, with the optical mode at the end of the cavity that does not include the second silicon waveguide  1223   b  (to the right in  FIG. 12A ) residing almost entirely in the active III-V gain material which is bounded below by air (or a dielectric). Note that this and related embodiments may provide efficient out-coupling for both QCLs and ICLs that are heterogeneously integrated with silicon. \\n     In some embodiments of the invention, an on-chip chemical sensor is formed by coupling the highly stable laser to a sensing region that is not incorporated within the laser cavity as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 4 and 6 . \\n     In the subset of embodiments illustrated in  FIG. 13A , a portion of the lasing mode is evanescently coupled into a passive waveguide  1314  as discussed above with respect to  FIG. 10 . Some section of the passive waveguide  1314  has an air top cladding, as in the configurations illustrated in  FIGS. 5A and 5B , so as to provide evanescent coupling to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The other end of the passive waveguide then couples to a detector waveguide section  1315  that also resides on the chip. The detector may be processed to have the same narrow ridge active waveguide or a similar active waveguide to the narrow ridge waveguide used in the highly-stable laser cavity. As discussed above and as shown in  FIG. 13B , the detector waveguide may optionally be bounded by DBRs that cause it to function as an RCID with increased sensitivity within the linewidth of the spectral resonance. Like the narrow ridge waveguide in the laser cavity, the detector waveguide has a top electrical contact that is used to detect a photocurrent due to light propagating in the detector waveguide when it is operated at zero bias, under a reverse bias, or under a forward bias below that required to reach the lasing threshold. \\n     In the case of a III-V PIC, an interband cascade detector (ICD) or quantum cascade detector (QCD) may be formed from the same active structure as the ICL or QCL source, as illustrated schematically in  FIG. 13A  and as discussed above regarding the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 6 . Alternatively, if the PIC resides on a silicon substrate, the III-V laser and detector structures bonded to the silicon chip may be the same or different. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 13A  illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a sensor in which a highly stable laser  1301  in accordance with the present invention, an extended passive sensing waveguide  1314 , and an ICD/QCD  1315  all reside on the same III-V chip. In III-V PIC embodiments such as that illustrated in  FIG. 13A , the passive waveguide  1314  that provides sensing may be extended to whatever length optimizes the sensitivity of the response of the ICD/QCD  1315  to the presence of the sample gas or liquid impinging on the sensor. The path followed by the waveguide in the sensing region can be straight or, as illustrated in the FIGURE, can be circuitous, so long as the path&#39;s minimum curvature does not induce an excessive bending loss.  FIG. 13  B illustrates that in some embodiments, the ICD or QCD  1315  is an in-plane resonant cavity detector that is bounded on both sides by Bragg mirrors  1319  (Meyer et al. &#39;699 patent, supra). \\n     In other embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 14 , the passive sensing waveguide may take the form of one or more ring resonators  1424  evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity  1401 . \\n     In such embodiments, the highly stable laser beam propagating in the laser cavity couples evanescently to a ring resonator  1424  formed by a passive waveguide whose top and/or sides are exposed to the ambient sample gas or liquid. The intensity of the light propagating in the ring is quantified by evanescently coupling the ring resonator to a waveguide  1414  that leads to a detector  1415  that absorbs the emission wavelength of the laser and resonance wavelength of the ring. As described above, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide with respect to the active waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 5A  or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . Naturally, the highly stable laser  1401  must emit at least some light at the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator, and the detector  1415  must be sensitive to light that is incident at that wavelength. \\n     Evanescent coupling of the laser to the ring resonator(s) may be realized by placing one section of the ring waveguide in close proximity to the laser waveguide, or by shaping the ring as a racetrack that evanescently couples to the laser cavity over an extended length. The ring resonator  1424  may have any closed-loop shape that assures low bending loss and a high quality factor Q. Coupling to the ring resonator or to a coupled mode of two ring resonators of slightly different sizes may induce the laser to operate in a single-spectral mode, without requiring the formation of a DFB grating or DBR mirrors. Some of the present inventors previously evanescently coupled ICLs to ring resonators, which was shown to induce laser emission in a single spectral mode. See W. W. Bewley et al., \u201cSingle-Mode Interband Cascade Lasers with Coupled Ring Resonators,\u201d  Conference on Lasers and Electro - Optics  (2011). \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 14 , the ring also evanescently couples to a passive waveguide  1414  that leads to a detector  1415  that interrogates the intensity of the optical beam output from the ring resonator. Therefore, measuring the photocurrent flowing in the detector while the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator is varied by temperature tuning or some other means can provide information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas or liquid. Furthermore, multiple ring resonators with different resonance wavelengths, along with detectors associated with each ring resonator, can provide information over a broader spectral range. If the sample gas contains a chemical species that absorbs light at the ring&#39;s resonance wavelength, the output from the ring is reduced by an amount related to the concentration of the absorbing gas species. The net absorption by the gas is enhanced significantly by the many round-trip passes through the high-Q ring cavity. The resonance wavelength of the ring may be tuned to coincide with an absorption feature of a given chemical species by varying the temperature of the sensing area, which in some embodiments may be controlled separately from the temperatures of the source and detector. If no chemical species in the sample gas absorbs at a resonance wavelength within the range that is scanned when the temperature is varied, the detected signal should not vary appreciably with resonance wavelength. \\n     In both of the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 13 and 14 , a passive connecting waveguide, which for an ICL PIC consists only of the core and cladding layers as illustrated in  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B , butt-couples directly to the detector waveguide that contains the full ICD or QCD structure. \\n     If the platform is a III-V PIC, the detector is an ICD or QCD formed from the same wafer material as the laser. In other embodiments, the platform may be formed from a different III-V material if multiple III-V active components are bonded to a common silicon PIC platform for coupling to silicon passive waveguides that form the ring resonator and passive connecting waveguides. Again, the detector may employ an unpatterned active waveguide, or function as an RCID for higher sensitivity if both boundaries of the absorber are bounded by DBRs as in  FIG. 13B . \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 15A  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the optical mode propagating in a passive waveguide  1514  evanescently couples to an adjacent detector waveguide  1515 , which is also shown in greater detail in  FIG. 15B . The geometry of the two waveguides is entirely analogous to the embodiment illustrated in  FIGS. 9 and 10 , which evanescently couples light propagating in the primary waveguide of a laser cavity to the secondary passive waveguide. In the case of evanescent coupling of the passive waveguide to a detector, the coupling strength should be maximized to the extent possible. With sufficient parallel coupling pathlength, nearly half the light can be transferred to the detector waveguide. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide that runs parallel to the detector waveguide may be bounded by DBRs that maximize the coupling strength for light at the resonant wavelength. \\n     To use the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 13-15  for on-chip spectroscopic sensing, the laser drive current and/or the temperature of the chip or some portion of the chip may be varied so as to tune the laser wavelength and/or ring resonance wavelength across a narrow fingerprint absorption feature of a given chemical species that may be present in the sample gas. To probe the optical absorption by the sample gas over a broader range of wavelengths, the highly stable laser may be configured as a sampled grating laser whose emission wavelength can be tuned over the entire spectral bandwidth of the gain material. See Kim et al., supra. A given thermal shift of the refractive index of the gain and/or ring resonator material then induces a larger tuning range than can be obtained by tuning a single optical mode. \\n     In other embodiments, current may be injected into the emitter waveguide at a level below the lasing threshold, so that it functions as a light emitting device (LED) or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) device with emission extending over a broader spectral band (much broader in the case of the LED). In those embodiments, a ring resonator waveguide that evanescently couples to the sample gas, and/or the resonance wavelength of an RCID formed by placing DBRs at each end of the detector&#39;s absorber waveguide, may filter the broadband output of the emitter to allow the spectral dependence of absorption by the sample gas to be determined on a much finer wavelength scale. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 16A  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which a single LED, ASE, or tunable ICL or QCL source  1625  emits into a passive bus waveguide  1614 , and then a series of single or coupled ring resonators  1624   a/b/c/d . . . n , each of which is tuned to a different resonance wavelength, evanescently couples to the same passive bus waveguide. The passive waveguides used for the bus, ring resonators, and connectors leading to the detectors may be formed from the lower SCL of the laser structure as shown in  FIGS. 5A and 5B . \\n     Each ring in the series selectively extracts its own resonance wavelength from the bus to allow the spectral dependence of the absorption to be determined. Each ring also couples into a passive waveguide  1614 / a/b / . . . , which in turn couples into to a corresponding ICD or QCD  1615   a/b/c/d . . . n , whose absorber waveguide section may optionally be bound at both ends by DBRs to form an RCID. This is analogous to an embodiment described by the inventors of the present invention in U.S. Pat. No. 10,333,011 supra except that the &#39;011 patent described an on-chip chemical sensor residing on a silicon platform, with silicon-based passive bus, ring resonator, and connecting waveguides, whereas the on-chip sensor illustrated in  FIG. 16  instead incorporates the entire chemical sensing system on a III-V PIC chip. \\n     In other embodiments of the invention, multiple on-chip sensors, each operating at a different resonance wavelength, are integrated onto the same III-V PIC. The block schematic in  FIG. 17  illustrates an embodiment in which each in a series of ring resonators  1724   a/b/c  . . . (or ring resonator pairs) evanescently couples to its own corresponding highly stable laser or broadband optical source with corresponding narrow-ridge waveguides  1703   a/b/c  . . . , in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor described above with respect to  FIG. 14 . Each ring resonator is exposed to the sample gas and couples to an ICD or QCD  1715   a/b/c  . . . that measures the beam intensity at the resonance wavelength of the given sensing element. Although three sensing elements operating at three different resonance wavelengths \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , and \u03bb 3  are shown in  FIG. 17 , any number sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 18  illustrates an alternative embodiment in which multiple extended passive sensing waveguides  1814   a/b/c  reside on the same chip in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor embodiment described above with respect to  FIG. 13 . In this embodiment, emission from each of an array of highly stable laser cavities  1801   a/b/c  (or broadband LEDs or ASE sources) is input into a corresponding extended passive waveguide  1814   a/b/c , etc., where the passive waveguides have air top claddings that allow evanescent coupling to the sample gas. Corresponding ICDs or QCDs  1815   a/b/c  that are coupled to each extended passive sensing waveguide  1814   a/b/c  measure the signal traversing the full length of each such passive waveguide, with each sensing element operating independently of the others. Again, although three independent sensing elements operating at three different wavelengths are illustrated in  FIG. 18 , any number of sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip. \\n     In this case, spectroscopic information is obtained by varying the DFB or DBR grating period to tune each individual single-spectral-mode laser  1801   a/b/c  to a different emission wavelength, or by employing broadband sources and varying the resonance wavelength of an RCID  1815 / a/b/c  that measures the intensity of the optical beam transmitted by the extended passive sensing waveguide. When multiple sensors operating at different resonance wavelengths are employed on the same chip, the different sensors can be tuned to wavelengths on and off the spectral fingerprint features of a given chemical, to several representative wavelengths that provide additional spectral details, or to use the same chip for detecting multiple chemical species. Fine-tuning of the sensing element resonance wavelengths can be implemented by locally or globally controlling the temperature on the chip, or by varying the current injected into each given laser source. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 19  illustrates that in some embodiments, the top of the passive waveguide in the sensing region can be coated by a chemical sorbent  1926  which can adsorb the molecules of certain classes of chemicals, thereby placing them in the immediate vicinity of the propagating light beam and enhancing their molecular concentration by orders of magnitude. See, e.g., T. H. Stievater et al., \u201cMicromechanical Photothermal Spectroscopy of Trace Gases Using Functionalized Polymers,\u201d Opt. Lett. 37, 2328 (2012). \\n     Thus, as shown in  FIG. 19 , the passive waveguide in such a case can include a GaSb substrate  1904 , a n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad layer  1905 , and a bottom GaSb SCL  1906 . Sorbent layer  1926  covers all of the SCL  1906  and the upper surface of the bottom clad layer  1905 , with the thickness of the sorbent coating preferably matching the vertical extent of the optical mode propagating in the passive waveguide. As in the other cases described herein, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in  FIG. 19  and in  FIG. 5A  or it may proceed only partway through the bottom SCL, as illustrated in  FIG. 5B . In addition, although  FIG. 19  illustrates a case where the chemical sorbent is deposited on a passive waveguide processed on an ICL chip, in other embodiments the sorbent may be deposited on the passive waveguides on a QCL PIC chip, or on passive silicon waveguides. \\n     As noted above, the cavity of a highly stable ICL may be configured with gain and saturable absorber sections so that it is passively mode locked and produces short pulses that appear as a frequency comb in the spectral domain, as was recently demonstrated in Bagheri et al. supra. Since the comb stability is often a primary factor limiting the detection sensitivity of dual-comb spectroscopy, it will be advantageous to exploit the greater stability provided by the architectural embodiments of the present invention. \\n     Thus, in some embodiments, both end mirrors of the highly stable frequency comb ICL are defined by HR-coated cleaved facets, and the laser output is obtained via evanescent coupling to a secondary passive waveguide. This is directly analogous to the configurations illustrated in  FIGS. 9, 11, and 15  for highly stable lasers that are not frequency combs, except that the cavity for the frequency comb laser is divided into gain and saturable absorber sections. As in the case of a highly stable non-frequency-comb laser, the laser cavity in a highly stable frequency-comb laser (ICL or QCL) can also be defined by an etched facet or a DBR mirror at one or both ends of the cavity. The output of such a highly stable frequency comb laser can be emitted from the chip, as illustrated in  FIGS. 10 and 11 , or it may be directed via the passive waveguide to some other region of the chip for functionality in a PIC as in  FIGS. 13 and 15 . For example, one or more highly stable frequency comb ICL(s) may be used as the source(s) for an on-chip chemical sensing system. \\n     In particular, two highly stable frequency combs may be employed on the same chip as sources for fully integrated on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy. See, e.g., L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMid-Infrared Dual-Comb Spectroscopy with Low Drive-Power On-Chip Sources,\u201d  Opt. Lett.  44, 2113 (2019). Dual-comb spectroscopy is known to offer high spectral resolution over a broad spectral bandwidth, combined with a very short acquisition time on the order of milliseconds. See, e.g., G. Villares et al., \u201cDual-Comb Spectroscopy Based on Quantum-Cascade-Laser Frequency Combs,\u201d  Nature Commun.  5, 6192 (2014). In dual-comb spectroscopy, information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas is obtained by using a fast detector to observe the multi-heterodyne beating of two frequency combs that have slightly different comb spacings (determined by the cavity length), so as to generate a direct link between the optical and RF domains. The beam from one of the combs interrogates the sample gas, whereas the other comb functions as a local oscillator whose beam does not come into contact with the sample gas. Both transmitted beams then coupled into the same on-chip ICD or QCD, whose output is input to an RF spectrum analyzer. Since a fast detector is required for rapid sensing measurement speed, it is advantageous that both ICDs and QCDs have displayed 3-dB bandwidths of up to 1 GHz and above. See H. Lotfi et al., \u201cHigh-Frequency Operation of a Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade System at Room Temperature,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  108, 201101 (2016); and F. R. Giorgetta et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Detectors,\u201d  IEEE J. Quant. Electron.  1039 (2009). \\n     For the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , the laser cavity  2001   a/b  of each comb is formed from a straight waveguide divided into a gain section  2028   a/b  and saturable absorber section  2029   a/b . As illustrated in  FIG. 20 , in this embodiment, the two ICL frequency comb lasers with slightly different comb spacings are situated at the same end of the chip to allow both to be mounted epitaxial-side-down, while the extended passive waveguide  2014   a  of the sensing region hangs over the edge of the mount to provide contact with the ambient sample gas. Both ends of each laser cavity are highly reflective, e.g., from a combination of HR-coated cleaved facets, HR-coated etched facets, and/or DBR mirrors, although this embodiment does not allow either frequency comb laser to be bounded on both sides by HR-coated cleaved facets. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , each of the frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b  (described herein as being ICLs, though QCLs can also be used) evanescently couples to a secondary passive waveguide  2014   a/b  that runs parallel to the active waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, as described above with respect to  FIGS. 9 and 10 . However, in other embodiments the output from one or both frequency comb ICLs may couple to its corresponding passive waveguide by butt-coupling the passive waveguide to a DBR mirror that defines the output end of the laser cavity. The output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL  2001   a  couples to an extended passive sensing waveguide  2014   a , whose top surface is exposed to ambient to allow evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the ambient sample gas. Absorption by the sample gas then affects the spectral dependence of the light signal reaching the detector following traversal of the extended passive sensing waveguide. The extended passive sensing waveguide, in turn, couples to the input of an on-chip ICD  2015 . The output from the second highly stable frequency comb ICL  2001   b  (the local oscillator) evanescently couples to a second, much shorter passive waveguide  2014   b  that proceeds directly to the same ICD  2015 . The signal transmitted by the second passive waveguide is not affected significantly by exposure to the sample gas, partly due to its much shorter length, and in some embodiments also because the second passive waveguide is encapsulated so as to prevent its propagating optical mode from coupling to the sample gas. \\n     The two passive waveguides shown in this figure are coupled to the same ICD by a Y-Junction, whose single output passive waveguide butt-couples to the ICD. \\n     In an alternative embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , the input passive waveguides  2114   a/b  can evanescently couple to the two sides of an ICD or QCD  2115  rather than coupling to the detector via a Y-junction as in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 . In still other embodiments, the passive waveguides can be combined by an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) or some other means known to the art before the combined beams are coupled to the ICD or QCD. The combined photocurrent signal measured by the fast ICD due to both transmitted beams is input to an RF spectrum analyzer that determines the multi-heterodyne beating of the two ICL frequency combs with slightly different comb spacings. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , two frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b , each having a gain section  2128   a/b  and a saturable absorber section  2129   a/b , and each having a slightly different comb spacing, are used. In this embodiment the cavity for each of the two frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b  is formed from a waveguide containing curved sections to form a laser cavity terminated at both ends at the same HR-coated cleaved facet  2102 , by analogy to the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 11  for a single laser, so that the same HR-coated cleaved facet provides both end mirrors for each of the two highly stable frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b . Both lasers can then reside at one end of the chip, while the extended passive sensing waveguide  2114   a , the shorter passive waveguide  2114   b , and the ICD  2115  can reside at the other end, so as to allow both frequency comb lasers to be mounted epitaxial side down while the extended passive sensing waveguide hangs over the edge of the mount to allow evanescent coupling of its top surface to the ambient sample gas. This configuration has the advantage that the common HR-coated cleaved facet, which provides both end mirrors for both frequency comb lasers, is generally much easier to process with high yield, using standard procedures, than an HR-coated etched mirror or a DBR. \\n     As in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 20 , in this embodiment, the output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL  2101   a  couples to an extended passive waveguide  2114   a  that evanescently couples to the sample gas, followed by input to the ICD  2115 . The second highly stable frequency comb ICL  2101   b  couples to a passive waveguide  2114   b  that leads directly to the same ICD  2115  without interacting with the sample gas, or its interaction is over a very short path length. \\n     In addition, in the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , both passive waveguides  2114   a/b  run parallel to an active waveguide in the ICD for some distance to allow transfer of the input beams to the detector waveguide. As in the case of embodiments where a single input waveguide couples to the detector evanescently, the embodiment that evanescently couples two input waveguides has the advantage of greater laser stability, because much lower fractions of the incoming beams are reflected back into the passive waveguides for unwanted feedback into the two lasers. However, a Y-Junction (as in  FIG. 20 ) or some other means known to the art may alternatively be used to couple both beams into the same ICD. \\n     In all of the on-chip dual-comb sensing embodiments, such as those illustrated in  FIGS. 20 and 21 , the extended waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to the sample gas can be coated with a chemical sorbent that concentrates the molecules of interest so as to substantially increase the absorption due to those molecules. \\n     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 21 , a DFB ICL seed laser  2101 -seed provides input to both combs, via passive waveguides  2101   c/d , to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers  2101   a/b  that reside on each side of the DFB laser  2101 -seed. The incorporation of a seed laser such as that shown in  FIG. 21  is optional for operation of the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy system of the invention. \\n     The block schematic in  FIG. 22  illustrates an exemplary PIC embodiment that employs a DFB ICL seed laser  2201 -seed to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers  2001   a/b  that reside on each side of the DFB laser  2201 -seed. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 22 , similar to the manner described above with respect to  FIG. 21 , both end mirrors for all three lasers are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, although numerous other geometries are possible while maintaining the same inventive design aspects, such as bounding one or both ends of one or more of the laser cavities by DBR or etched mirrors. In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 22 , two passive waveguides  2214   a  and  2214   b  are evanescently coupled to the active waveguide of the DFB ICL at each end of its cavity. Each of those passive waveguides  2114   a/b  then couples light from the DFB ICL to each of the frequency comb ICLs  2001   a/b , which may have the effect of locking them to the DFB emission wavelength, provided that wavelength is sufficiently close to one of the teeth of the frequency combs. The two comb outputs may either be emitted from the chip, e.g., at one of the end facets, or be evanescently coupled into output waveguides  2214   a/b  to be used elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a III-V or silicon PIC. \\n     Other embodiments of III-V PICs designed in accordance with the invention may provide on-chip spectral beam combining to scale the laser power that can be output into a single high-quality beam, as illustrated by the block schematic in  FIG. 23 . In this embodiment, a QCL or ICL array  2331  of DFB or DBR lasers is patterned to have slightly different grating pitches so that each laser emits at a slightly different wavelength. The outputs from the lasers in the array can be butt-coupled to passive waveguides  2314   a/b / . . . designed and processed in accordance with the invention (e.g., as described above with respect to  FIG. 5A  or  FIG. 5B  in the case of an ICL), with partially-reflecting DBRs. In other embodiments, the refractive index mismatch at the interface between the active and passive waveguides, as shown in  FIG. 4B , defines one end mirror for each laser cavity. The outputs from the various array elements emitting at different wavelengths may then be input to an AWG  2332  for spectral beam combining into a single output waveguide  2314 -out. The array output with much higher power than each individual array element is then emitted from the chip at a single waveguide aperture  2333 . Processing protocols for mounting such an array epitaxial side down are well known to the art. \\n     In some embodiments, the same highly-stable laser cavity evanescently couples to two different passive waveguides. In the embodiment shown in  FIG. 24A , the two passive waveguides  2414   a/b  run in parallel to the laser cavity  2401  for evanescent coupling on the same side of the laser ridge but at opposite ends of the cavity. Alternatively, for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 24B  the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at the same end of the cavity, while in the embodiment shown in  FIG. 24C  the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at opposite ends of the cavity. \\n     In all of these embodiments, both passive waveguides have the same extended length with the same shape, and at the opposite end both couple to ICDs or QCDs integrated on the chip. However, one extended passive waveguide is exposed to the sample gas while the other serves as a reference because it is not exposed. For example, exposure of the reference extended waveguide to the sample gas can be prevented by encapsulating that portion of the chip in a hermetic dome that the sample gas does not penetrate. \\n     All of these embodiments have the advantage of providing a reference signal that propagates through the same length and shape of waveguide for detection by an identical ICD or QCD that nominally operates at the same temperature due to its close proximity on the chip, but which is not attenuated by absorption associated with trace chemicals in the sample gas. The extended waveguide  2414   a  that is exposed to the sample gas may be covered with a sorbent to enhance the concentration of trace chemicals of interest. In that case, the signal detected for the extended waveguide  2414   a  coated with the sorbent may be compared to the signal for a reference extended waveguide  2414   b  that is not coated with the sorbent. \\n     In some embodiments, multi-spectral detection is obtained by positioning multiple in-plane interband or quantum cascade resonant cavity infrared detectors with different resonance wavelengths along a single multi-spectral detection waveguide. \\n       FIG. 25A  illustrates an embodiment of a chemical sensing PIC that integrates on the same III-V or silicon chip a highly stable laser cavity  2501 , an extended passive waveguide  2514  whose top surface is exposed to a sample gas, and a series of multi-wavelength RCIDs  2515   a/b / . . . that are positioned in series along the same multi-spectral detection waveguide  2534 , which receives the optical signal transmitted by the extended passive waveguide  2514 . A DBR mirror  2519  is positioned on each side of each detector in the multi-spectral series of detectors, with each set of two such DBR mirrors that bound a given RCID is formed by etching gratings with a different pitch than the gratings that form the two DBRs that bound any other RCID in the series, so that each RCID in the series operates at a different resonance wavelength. Preferably, each RCID, consisting of the detector  2515  and DBR mirrors  2519 , butt-couples to the next, with no space between the grating for one DBR with a given grating pitch and the grating for the next DBR with a different grating pitch. \\n     In the case of an ICD RCID, it may be preferable to etch the grating into the passive waveguide structure, as illustrated in  FIG. 8B , rather than into the full waveguide structure as illustrated in  FIG. 8A . This is because optical loss due to absorption in the active quantum wells can degrade the quality factor of the RCID cavities if the DBRs are formed by etching the grating into the full active structure. The absorption loss in the active quantum wells is of less concern for a QCD RCID, particularly if the DBRs are ion bombarded to trap free carriers and further reduce the loss as discussed above. \\n     The photocurrent flowing in any given RCID is sensitive primarily to incoming light having a wavelength falling within one linewidth of the resonance wavelength of that RCID, whereas most of the incoming optical signal that does not fall within the narrow spectral linewidth of that RCID is transmitted to the next RCID, since the DBR mirrors do not provide high reflection of any non-resonance wavelength, and the longitudinal length L of the absorber in each RCID is short enough that only a small fraction of the beam is absorbed during a single pass through the absorber. However, most of the spectral component of the incoming optical signal that falls within the narrow spectral linewidth of the given RCID is absorbed, since the quality factor Q of the cavity defined by the two DBRs on each side of the RCID, in combination with the longitudinal pathlength L of the absorber for that RCID, provide high absorption quantum efficiency following multiple longitudinal passes of the selected spectral portion of the beam through the RCID. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in  FIG. 25 , the multi-spectral detection waveguide  2534  terminates at an HR-coated facet  2502 , or some other broadband mirror that provides a second pass of the optical signal through the multi-spectral series of RCIDs. \\n     Each RCID in the series has a separate top contact that allows the photocurrent generated by the portion of the incoming signal falling within the selected spectral bandwidth of the given RCID to be measured. In some embodiments of a III-V PIC, the circuit is completed by a common ground contact to the substrate side of the chip, which also provides a common ground contact for all the interband or quantum cascade optical emitters on the chip. In the case of a silicon PIC, both contacts to the interband or quantum cascade RCID must be processed on the top side of the chip. \\n     By tuning each RCID to a different resonance wavelength, via the grating pitch of the DBRs surrounding that RCID, the intensity of the incoming signal can be measured as a function of wavelength. Combining the information received from the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series then provides a spectral characterization of the incoming signal. The spectral bandwidths of the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series may be designed to nearly overlap, so that a continuous spectrum can be obtained, or the resonances for the different RCIDs may be selected to detect a pre-determined set of non-contiguous wavelengths of interest. \\n     If the chemical sensing PIC employs an source with broad spectral bandwidth, such as an infrared light emitting diode (LED) such as the interband cascade LED (see C. S. Kim et al.,  Opt. Engr.  57, 011002 (2018), \u201cImproved Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade Light Emitting Devices\u201d), an infrared amplified spontaneous emission device (e.g., M. C. Zheng et al., Opt. Expr.  23 ,  2713 , \u201cHigh power spiral cavity quantum cascade superluminescent emitter\u201d), or simply an ICL or QCL, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs can be used as the primary means for determining the spectrum for optical transmission through the extended passive waveguide  2514 . This approach may sometimes be more straightforward to implement than the series of ring resonators that is employed to provide spectral information for the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 16 . An advantage of employing a silicon PIC to implement the multi-spectral series of detectors is that DBRs with low loss and high Q may be more straightforward to process with high yield (Spott,  Photonics  2016 supra) than is possible with DBRs processed on a III-V PIC. \\n     More generally, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs may be used to provide multi-spectral detection of any signal propagating in an incoming passive waveguide. For example, it may be used for multi-spectral or hyper-spectral detection or imaging that on a PIC that does not integrate optical sources on the same chip. \\n     Numerous variations on the inventive embodiments described above are possible. For example,  FIGS. 3, 5, and 19  illustrate specific passive and active waveguide configurations that provide evanescent coupling of the beam propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. A variety of alternative designs for both the semiconductor layering design and the passive waveguide profile will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, starting with a QCL III-V epitaxial structure a passive waveguide may be constructed with a bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the bottom InP cladding layer as the bottom clad of the passive waveguide. The InGaAs bottom SCL thickness should be designed for optimal operation of both the highly stable QCL and the passive waveguide. It was mentioned above that ion bombardment of the passive or active waveguide on a QCL chip may deplete the free electrons so as to further reduce the waveguide loss. QCL chips designed for LWIR operation can be used to expand the spectral coverage of III-V PICs incorporating QCLs and QCDs to on-chip chemical sensors probing wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm. \\n     When the laser output is emitted from the chip (e.g., as in the embodiments illustrated in  FIGS. 10 and 11 ), the advantageous enhanced stability that is realized when only a small fraction of the power is coupled out of the cavity per pass may be applied to diode lasers operating on any III-V substrate and emitting at any wavelength. This includes near-IR, visible, and ultraviolet diode lasers that may reside on InP, GaAs, GaN, or other III-V substrates, for which passive waveguides may be designed for compatibility with the given laser structure. While a similar enhancement of the laser stability may be induced by applying an HR coating to the output facet defining one end of the laser cavity, the invention&#39;s evanescently-coupled output from the side of the laser cavity provides simpler processing as well as much greater control over the out-coupling fraction per pass (via the double-waveguide profile, the spacer width between the two waveguides, and the distance over which the two waveguides propagate parallel to one another). \\n     In some embodiments, both ends of the highly stable laser cavity are bounded by HR-coated facets that do not provide any significant spectral selectivity. The two mirrors at opposite ends of the laser cavity may be formed by two facets cleaved on opposite ends of a chip, as illustrated in  FIG. 10 , by two mirrors located on the same cleaved facet as illustrated in  FIG. 11 , or by etching an HR-coated facet to form at least one of the mirrors. In the embodiments of  FIGS. 10 and 11 , some fraction of the light is evanescently coupled to a second waveguide that is passive, although in other embodiments the second active waveguide may be active in order to minimize loss (if biased below the gain threshold) or provide further amplification of the optical signal (if biased above the gain threshold). \\n     In other embodiments, a DBR mirror defines at least one end of the highly stable laser. Some fraction of the light can then couple into a passive or active output waveguide that emerges from the opposite end of the partially-reflecting DBR mirror, as illustrated in  FIG. 8 . Both out-coupling via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide and out-coupling at a DBR mirror provide flexibility in the trade between laser stability and out-coupling efficiency. In the case of evanescent out-coupling to a second waveguide, the fraction of light in the laser cavity that is out-coupled per pass depends on the coupling strength between the two waveguides, which may be varied through adjustment of their separation distance and waveguide profiles. In the alternative case of out-coupling from a partially-reflecting DBR mirror that defines one end of the laser cavity, the etch depth and number of periods may be tuned to adjust the mirror reflectivity. It may be more straightforward to realize a broad range of out-coupling efficiencies when the DBR mirror approach is employed. In terms of positioning it is also more flexible to define the laser cavity by DBR mirrors, since the laser can then be placed anywhere within a PIC, whereas defining the cavity with one or more HR-coated cleaved facets requires that the laser be proximate to one or more boundaries of the chip. \\n     In many embodiments, such as when stable output into a single spectral mode is desired, these two approaches to out-coupling may be used interchangeably. Which is preferable for use in a given PIC may depend in part on whether it is more straightforward to process a DBR or a double waveguide with separation close enough to provide substantial evanescent coupling. In the latter case, the laser cavity must also incorporate a DFB grating or other means of longitudinal mode selection if lasing in a single spectral mode is required. Which architecture is less challenging to fabricate with higher yield will depend in part on the material constituents, and also on the profiles and dimensions of the waveguides. However, in cases where lasing should not occur in a single spectral mode, e.g., when the laser is a frequency comb, a DBR mirror cannot be used to define either end of the laser cavity. \\n     In some embodiments, the laser source emits in a narrow spectral linewidth due to the implementation of a DFB grating. One or both ends of the cavity are then defined by DBR mirrors or some other means known to the art. In some embodiments, the narrow-linewidth emission wavelength may be tuned over some limited bandwidth by current, temperature, or some other means such as a sampled grating. The spectral bandwidth can be extended by disposing multiple laser sources on the same chip, which are coupled to multiple sensing regions, or by coupling a single laser source to multiple resonant cavities as illustrated in  FIG. 16 . Alternatively, the on-chip IR source may be a broadband emitter such as an LED or ASE source rather than a laser operating with a narrow spectral linewidth. \\n     The sensing region may consist of an extended passive waveguide, or it may take the form of a ring or other high-Q resonator (or coupled pairs of such resonators) that substantially extend the effective path length for sensing. \\n     The on-chip detector may be an ICD or QCD formed on the same III-V chip from the same epitaxial structure as the laser, or it may be formed from a different III-V, II-VI, or IV-VI active detector material bonded to the same silicon platform as the laser, or it may be an in-plane silicon bolometer processed as part of a silicon PIC. In the case of an ICD or QCD detector, the photocurrent may be collected at zero bias, at a reverse bias, or at a forward bias below the lasing threshold. The latter may be advantageous, for example, to minimize the loss induced by a detector integrated into the laser cavity as illustrated in  FIG. 6 . The absorber region of the detector may be placed within a resonant cavity for operation as a resonant cavity infrared detector by processing DBR mirrors at both ends of the absorber region. \\n     By combining these options for the MWIR optical source, the sensing region, and the detector, the spectral dependence of the absorption by the sample gas may be determined by tuning the resonance wavelength of the source, the sensing region if it incorporates a resonant cavity, or the detector. If more than one of these operates in a narrow spectral band, the resonance wavelengths must be matched by careful design and calibration, independent temperature tuning of the different regions, or some other means. Spectral information may also be obtained by combining multiple sensors on the same chip, with each operating at a different wavelength. \\n     Many of the embodiments disclosed above apply equally to PICs integrated on either a III-V or silicon substrate, while others are only advantageous when applied to III-V PICs. \\n     Some aspects of the invention may be advantageous even if an entire chemical sensing system is not integrated on the same III-V or silicon chip. For example, one or more highly stable laser sources and passive sensing waveguides in accordance with the invention may be combined on a III-V or silicon chip, in conjunction with coupling into one or more detectors that reside off the chip. Or similarly, one or more off-chip optical sources may be used in conjunction with one or more passive waveguide sensing areas and one or more infrared detectors residing on the chip. \\n     While the descriptions of the invention as applied to MWIR and LWIR PICs have assumed laser sources based on either type-II GaSb-based ICL structures or InP-based QCL structures, the invention applies equally to other cascade laser structures. These include type-I ICLs that may similarly function as ICDs when operated at zero bias, ICLs grown on InAs substrates, and QCLs grown on GaAs, InAs, GaSb, GaN, or silicon substrates. See, e.g., L. Shterengas et al., \u201cType-I Quantum Well Cascade Diode Lasers Emitting Near 3 \u03bcm,\u201d  Appl. Phys. Lett.  103, 121108 (2013). \\n     The in-plane waveguides in which the optical signals propagate may be formed entirely within the III-V semiconductor from which the active detector layers are formed, or by depositing or bonding to some other material to form the core and/or clad for a waveguide. For example, chalcogenide materials may be deposited and patterned to form waveguides within a III-V or silicon PIC. \\n     Advantages and New Features \\n     A III-V or Si PIC designed for chemical sensing that is based on any of the embodiments described in this invention will be suitable for mass production of hundreds of chemical sensors on the same chip. The individual sensors can then be singulated to form the basis for a package that is both extremely compact and inexpensive. \\n     A primary advantage of most of the disclosed embodiments is the high stability of the laser source or multiple laser sources used therein, which is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC. \\n     The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating. \\n     The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity. \\n     Although the present disclosure describes and illustrates various specific embodiments, aspects, and features, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the invention described herein is not limited to only the described embodiments, aspects, and features but also contemplates any and all modifications and alternative embodiments that are within the spirit and scope of the underlying invention described and claimed herein.

See, e.g., B. Tromborg et al., \u201cStability Analysis for a Semiconductor Laser,\u201d <i>IEEE J. Quant. Electron. </i>20, 1023 (1984); V. Svedas, \u201cThe Significance of Lidar Pulse Stability in the IR Detection of Hazardous Compounds,\u201d <i>IEEE Sensors Journal </i>14, 1391 (2014); and L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMultiheterodyne Spectroscopy Using Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d <i>Opt. Engr. </i>57, 011014 (2018).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">A major source of instability is feedback from unwanted secondary optical cavities that form due to reflections from one or more surfaces encountered outside the intended primary cavity. The primary cavity of an edge-emitting diode laser is typically defined by coated or uncoated cleaved facets of the laser chip, although mirrors formed by distributed Bragg reflectors, etched facets, or other means may also be employed. While a parasitic secondary cavity may result from feedback within the chip, it is more often due to feedback from an external optic or other surface that is encountered after the beam leaves the output facet of the laser. See S. Takeda and S. Nakagawa, \u201cFeedback Tolerance of DFB Laser for Silicon Photonics Packaging,\u201d <i>Opt. Expr. </i>22, 8451 (2014).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Inevitable mechanical and thermal vibrations in a laser device cause the secondary cavity length to vary, which induces temporal \u201cjitter\u201d of the magnitude and spectral characteristics of the secondary lasing modes. Such instabilities in the lasing mode and output power can, for example, seriously degrade the sensitivity of a spectroscopy-based trace chemical measurement as a result of small variations in the laser signal transmitted through a sample gas or liquid. Although an optical isolator can minimize the feedback from external optical elements, the expense, bulk, and wavelength-specificity of such isolators make them unsuitable for incorporation into an ultra-compact chemical sensing system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">The cavity for a conventional narrow-ridge edge-emitting semiconductor laser is most commonly formed by cleaving two high-quality facets that define the two ends of the cavity. Typically, one of the facets (called the back facet) is coated for high reflection (HR), while the light generated within the laser is emitted from the other (front, or output) facet. The output facet may be left uncoated, in which case its reflectivity R is typically 25-40%, or it may be coated to optimize desired figures of merit. For example, the efficiency is generally maximized by applying an anti-reflection (AR) coating that reduces R to a few percent or less, whereas the threshold current density can be minimized by applying a coating with reflectivity higher than that of an uncoated facet (but which nonetheless allows some light to be transmitted to provide the laser output). Other means known to the art may also be employed to form the laser cavity, for example, by etching rather than cleaving one or both facets, or by processing distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity. See, e.g., M. Ariga, et al., \u201cLow Threshold GaInAsP Lasers with Semiconductor/Air Distributed Bragg Reflector Fabricated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Etching,\u201d <i>Jpn. J Appl. Phys. </i>39, 3406 (2000).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">When any of those conventional configurations are employed, the stability of the laser output can be compromised by unwanted feedback from optical elements residing outside the laser cavity. In the case of emission from an end facet, for example, external optical elements may reflect light back into the cavity to provide unwanted time-variant feedback.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">In other cases, the laser cavity may be integrated on a chip with other optical components, and some means such as tapers and/or DBR mirrors may be employed to define the cavity, while transferring some fraction of the laser power into a waveguide for use elsewhere in a photonic integrated circuit (PIC).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Lasers have been integrated with other optical components to form PICs on III-V and silicon chips, as well as other substrate platforms. While a laser integrated in a PIC and emitting into a waveguide may experience little or no parasitic feedback from external optical elements, it may nonetheless may receive parasitic feedback from downstream optical elements residing elsewhere in the PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">PICs operating at telecommunications wavelengths in the near infrared have by now become relatively mature. See C. Zhang and J. E. Bowers, \u201cSilicon photonic terabit/s network-on-chip for datacenter interconnection,\u201d <i>Optical Fiber Technology </i>44, 2 (2018)]. On the other hand, PICs operating at longer wavelengths in the extended shortwave infrared (ESWIR, defined here as \u03bb=2-3 \u03bcm), midwave infrared (MWIR, defined here as \u03bb=3-6 \u03bcm), and longwave infrared (LWIR, defined here as \u03bb=6-14 \u03bcm) spectral bands remain in the early stages of development. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,612,398 to Vurgaftman et al., entitled \u201cUltra-Broadband Photonic Integrated Circuit Platform\u201d; see also A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated 2.0 \u03bcm CW Hybrid Silicon Lasers at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>40, 1480 (2015); A. Spott et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d <i>Optica </i>3, 545 (2016) (\u201cSpott, <i>Optica </i>2016\u201d); and Y. Zhang et al., \u201cThin-Film Antimonide-Based Photodetectors Integrated on Si,\u201d <i>IEEE J. Quant. Electron. </i>54, 4000207 (2018). Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with InAs quantum wells have recently been realized by growing the III-V gain material directly on a silicon chip. See H. Nguyen-Van et al., \u201cQuantum Cascade Lasers Grown on Silicon,\u201d <i>Sci. Reports </i>8, 7206 (2018). There have been several experimental demonstrations of midwave infrared (MWIR, 2.5-6 \u03bcm) QCLs and interband cascade lasers (ICLs) integrated on silicon. See e.g., &#39;398 patent, supra; see also Spott, <i>Optica </i>2016, supra; A. Spott et al., \u201cHeterogeneously Integrated Distributed Feedback Quantum Cascade Lasers on Silicon,\u201d <i>Photonics </i>3, 35 (2016) (\u201cSpott, <i>Photonics </i>2016\u201d); A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d IEEE Photonics Conference (1-5 Oct. 2017, Orlando Fla.); and A. Spott et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Laser on Silicon,\u201d <i>Optica </i>5, 996 (2018).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">Most of these have been integrated on silicon chips, although the preliminary performance of such integrated devices has been limited in part by the challenge of bonding III-V wafer material to silicon and subsequent processing of the laser ridges from the back. Most often, the optical mode in the gain region of a silicon-based PIC is \u201chybrid,\u201d in that it is shared between the III-V gain material and an underlying silicon waveguide. See Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016, supra. Tapers of the III-V mesa material are then introduced at the boundaries between the hybrid and silicon waveguide sections, in order to adiabatically couple the generated light from one waveguide to the other. However, the performance of these MWIR PICs has been limited in part by inefficient transfer (to date) at the tapers of laser power from the \u201chybrid\u201d III-V/silicon waveguide of the gain region to a passive silicon waveguide that is suitable for coupling the generated laser beam to other optical elements incorporated into a silicon-based PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">At shorter wavelengths in the near infrared (NIR), such tapers have provided efficient coupling between the two waveguide sections. See, e.g., C. Zhang, \u201cLow Threshold and High Speed Short Cavity Distributed Feedback Hybrid Silicon Lasers,\u201d <i>Opt. Expr. </i>22, 10202 (2014). In those integrated lasers, most of the optical mode in the hybrid waveguide resides in the silicon portion of the waveguide rather than the III-V portion, and so gradual tapering to a silicon waveguide introduces only a relatively minor perturbation of the mode profile.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">However, the tapers employed in the integrated QCL and ICL demonstrations to date have induced much more reflection (and in some cases loss) than transmission of the laser beam propagating in the hybrid waveguide. This is probably due in part to the requirement for a much more abrupt evolution of the mode, which in the MWIR devices has been concentrated mostly in the III-V rather than the silicon portion of the hybrid waveguide. This mode distribution has been motivated by a concern that the gain would otherwise not be sufficient to overcome the higher waveguide loss at the longer wavelength, particularly in the case of a QCL that characteristically has relatively low material gain.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">A number of demonstrations of interband cascade detectors (ICDs) and quantum cascade detectors (QCDs) have been reported in recent years. These have employed absorber and injector quantum well configurations quite similar to those used in corresponding laser structures that are designed for emission near the detector cut-off wavelength in the case of an ICD, see J. V. Li et al., \u201cInterband Cascade Detectors with Room Temperature Photovoltaic Operation,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>86, 101102 (2005), or near the intersubband resonance wavelength in the case of a QCD, see F. R. Giorgetta, \u201c16.5 \u03bcm Quantum Cascade Detector Using Miniband Transport,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>90, 231111 (2007).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">In fact, ICDs have been processed on the same chip with ICLs, see H. Lotfi et al., \u201cMonolithically Integrated Mid-IR Interband Cascade Laser and Photodetector Operating at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>109, 151111 (2016), and QCDs have been processed on the same chip with QCLs, see B. Schwarz et al., \u201cWatt-Level Continuous-Wave Emission from a Bifunctional Quantum Cascade Laser/Detector,\u201d <i>ACS Photonics </i>4, 1225 (2017), using the same multi-stage quantum well wafer material in both cases. ICDs and QCDs are capable of operating at room temperature, which is generally required for chemical sensing via evanescent coupling to a sample gas. It should be noted that neither the laser power nor the detector absorption per unit length needs to be high, since the optical beam generated by the laser can propagate a relatively long distance in the waveguide in the detector section of the chip, to allow spectroscopic detection based on attenuation by the fingerprint absorption features. However, the optical loss in the passive waveguide must be sensitive to absorption by the same gas, rather than being strongly dominated by other parasitic loss mechanisms.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">This summary is intended to introduce, in simplified form, a selection of concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. Instead, it is merely presented as a brief overview of the subject matter described and claimed herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">In embodiments for which optical output from the laser cavity is required, the invention provides a means for isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n

id=\"h-0006\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">The aspects and features of the present invention summarized above can be embodied in various forms. The following description shows, by way of illustration, combinations and configurations in which the aspects and features can be put into practice. It is understood that the described aspects, features, and/or embodiments are merely examples, and that one skilled in the art may utilize other aspects, features, and/or embodiments or make structural and functional modifications without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">The present invention provides a highly compact on-chip chemical sensor comprising one or more highly stable ICLs or QCLs integrated on a III-V or silicon chip with other optical components on the same chip. This will be accomplished by coupling the MWIR or LWIR laser source into a passive extended or resonant-cavity waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to a sample gas (or liquid) for spectroscopic chemical sensing. The uppermost layer of this passive waveguide has a relatively high index of refraction, enabling it to form the core of the waveguide, while the ambient air, consisting of the sample gas, functions as the top cladding layer. A fraction of the propagating light beam is absorbed by the sample gas if it contains a chemical species having a fingerprint absorption feature within the spectral linewidth of the laser emission.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">For the on-chip sensor embodiments which incorporate the sensor waveguide into the laser cavity in accordance with the present invention, the measured signal corresponds to the ratio of differential absorption induced by the sample gas to the net loss in the cavity, i.e., the sum of internal losses in the various waveguide sections and reflection losses at the two ends of the cavity. It follows that the minimum differential absorption that can be detected depends critically on the laser stability, since any jitter or other fluctuation in the laser operation will wash out a small differential signal. Therefore, it is highly beneficial that the highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention, which has no optical interactions at all with the outside world apart from evanescent coupling to the sample gas, is highly useful in such on-chip sensors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">For embodiments in which light is output from the laser cavity, either for emission from the chip or for use elsewhere in a PIC residing on the chip, high laser stability is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">As described in more detail below, the building blocks needed to construct an on-chip chemical sensor in accordance with the invention include (1) a highly stable laser source, (2) low-loss passive waveguides or actively pumped/amplifying sections to enable interconnections, (3) a passive sensing waveguide with evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid, and (4) an interband or quantum cascade detector. Each of these is described below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">In some embodiments, the top of the waveguide in the sensing region may be coated with a chemical sorbent with a distinct absorption signature that selectively attaches a certain class of chemicals that diffuse into the sorbent from the sample gas. This can significantly enhance the absorption associated with a given concentration of molecules in the sample gas. Such a sensor on a single chip may provide spectroscopic sensing over some range of wavelengths between \u22482.5 \u03bcm and \u22486 \u03bcm when an interband cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip, or over some range of wavelengths between \u22484 \u03bcm and \u224812 \u03bcm when a quantum cascade structure provides the optical sources and detectors on a III-V chip. When III-V active gain and detector materials are bonded to a silicon chip to form the PIC, sources and detectors operating at any number of MWIR and LWIR wavelengths may in principle be combined on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">The present invention provides a novel and effective means for strongly suppressing laser instabilities associated with unintended external feedback. By much more effectively isolating the laser cavity on the chip, the invention substantially reduces all interactions with external elements. Although the enhanced laser stability may sometimes be traded against a reduction of the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency, an additional benefit is the potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power required to operate the laser. For some applications these trades may be highly advantageous.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">In the case of a III-V PIC, attenuation of the infrared light beam propagating in the passive waveguide is quantified by an ICD or QCD fabricated from the same III-V multi-stage active quantum well structure as the ICL or QCL. Whereas a forward bias is required to produce gain and lasing, an ICD or QCD is typically operated at or near zero bias, although a reverse bias or sub-threshold forward bias may also be applied.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">Some embodiments of the present invention obviate the issue of inefficient coupling of the active and passive waveguides at the tapers, by replacing them with a more reliable means for coupling between different waveguide sections. In embodiments of the invention that employ a PIC on a III-V chip, no transfers between hybrid and silicon waveguides are required at all.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">These and other features of various embodiments of highly stable lasers and sensors integrated on the same chip are now described with reference to the FIGURES which are filed concurrently herewith and which form a part of the present disclosure. It will be noted that in the FIGURES and in the description below, elements that appear in more than one FIGURE are denoted by the same reference number, with only the first digit being changed to reflect the number of the FIGURE being described. For example, a laser cavity of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention is denoted as \u201claser cavity <b>101</b>\u201d when discussed in the context of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and as \u201claser cavity <b>601</b>\u201d when discussed in the context of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>; similarly, the narrow-ridge laser waveguide is denoted with reference number <b>103</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and with reference number <b>403</b> in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">A highly stable interband or quantum cascade laser in accordance with the present invention is formed by creating a laser cavity with very weak interactions with any optical elements outside the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a simplest embodiment of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, such a highly stable laser includes a laser cavity <b>101</b> consisting of an ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide <b>103</b> bounded by a mirror at each end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">In this baseline configuration, the laser experiences no interactions at all with optical elements outside the laser cavity. The laser cavity illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is defined by two end facets <b>102</b> <i>a</i>/<b>102</b> <i>b </i>that are each coated with a high-reflectivity (HR) metal such as Au, with a dielectric spacer to prevent electrical shorting. In this embodiment, the two end facets are formed by cleaving the wafer from which the cavity is formed. In other embodiments, other highly reflecting end mirrors, such as etched facets with HR coatings or distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), may be employed at one or both ends of the cavity. While \u22480.5 mm represents a practical limit to the minimum cavity length that can be formed with high yield by conventional cleaving methods, shorter cavity lengths are more straightforward if a portion of the waveguide curves such that the mirrors defining both ends of the cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as discussed below, or if the cavity is defined by etching one or both facets or by processing DBRs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">A highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention may be induced to lase in a single spectral mode by first requiring the laser ridge to be narrow enough to support lasing in only a single lateral mode. DBRs may then be used at one or both ends of the laser cavity to select a single longitudinal mode, while in other embodiments, the ridge may be patterned with a distributed feedback (DFB) grating. Since there is no opportunity for feedback from an external optical element to influence operation of the laser, its stability is likely to be determined primarily by the stability of the drive electronics or by thermal fluctuations from the environment (which typically take place on a relatively long time scale). Vibrations should have little effect, since all of the internal lengths are fixed and the reflectors defining the cavity should generally vibrate in unison.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">In some embodiments, the laser ridge may be processed on its native III-V chip using conventional fabrication methods, while in other embodiments, it may be integrated on a silicon chip by growing the III-V active gain material on silicon or by growing on the native III-V substrate and then bonding to silicon as discussed above. Processing on the native III-V chip rather than silicon is generally more straightforward and less expensive, and is likely to produce higher yield.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">Of course, a laser having no interaction at all with anything outside its own cavity cannot perform any useful function. However, interaction can be obtained without introducing any potential for feedback from external optical elements by evanescently coupling some or all of the laser&#39;s ridge waveguide to an ambient sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">In all of the embodiments of the invention described below, a common bottom contact on the substrate of the ICL or QCL wafer is employed, although embodiments with both contacts made to the top of the wafer may also employ the same inventive aspects. A substantial fraction of the optical mode resides in the top and bottom n<sup>\u2212</sup>-GaSb separate confinement layers (SCLs), which exhibit low loss and high refractive index.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a typical cross section for a conventional ICL narrow-ridge waveguide that is formed by processing ICL wafer material which is typically grown by molecular beam epitaxy. In preferred embodiments, the sidewalls of the ridge waveguide of the narrow-ridge ICL are etched to below the active stages to prevent current spreading in the wafer.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">The conventional narrow-ridge waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is formed by processing ICL wafer material that includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>204</b> with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>205</b> on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL) <b>206</b> on an upper surface of bottom clad <b>205</b>, active ICL gain stages <b>207</b> on an upper surface of SCL <b>206</b>, a top GaSb SCL <b>208</b> on an upper surface of the active gain stages, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad <b>209</b> on an upper surface of top SCL <b>208</b>, and a thin n<sup>+</sup>-InAs or n<sup>+</sup>-InAsSb top contact layer <b>210</b> on an upper surface of top clad <b>209</b>. A layer of a dielectric <b>211</b> such as SiN is deposited on the ridge sidewalls, followed by metallization on top of the ridge to provide a top electrical contact <b>212</b>. The bottom contact (not shown) is usually made to n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>204</b>. The arrows in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> indicate the direction of current flow when a forward bias is applied to produce gain for lasing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the cross section for an exemplary embodiment of an alternative ICL ridge waveguide that is modified such that part of the top SCL is exposed to ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid. As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, such an alternative ICL ridge waveguide, like the conventional waveguide described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>304</b> with an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>305</b> on an upper surface thereof, a bottom GaSb separate confinement layer (SCL) <b>306</b> on an upper surface of bottom clad <b>305</b>, active ICL gain stages <b>307</b> on an upper surface of SCL <b>306</b>, a top GaSb SCL <b>308</b> on an upper surface of the active gain stages <b>307</b>, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice top clad <b>309</b> on an upper surface of top SCL <b>308</b>, and a thin n<sup>+</sup>-InAs or n<sup>+</sup>-InAsSb top contact layer <b>310</b> on an upper surface of top clad <b>309</b>. After the narrow-ridge waveguide has been etched, a dielectric layer <b>311</b> is deposited on the sidewalls to prevent electrical shorting and metal is deposited to form a top contact <b>312</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">Unlike the conventional waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, in the waveguide in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, one sidewall of the active ICL stages <b>307</b>, the top SCL <b>308</b>, and top clad <b>309</b>, as well as a portion of bottom SCL <b>306</b> are exposed to permit coupling of the lasing mode to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The lasing threshold, slope efficiency, and maximum output power then provide information about whether the ambient sample gas contains any trace chemicals with absorption features at the laser wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">Numerous variations of this exemplary embodiment will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, in some variations, a double ridge may be formed to provide weak index guiding of the lasing mode, with the inner ridge etched to a depth above the active stages and the outer ridge etched to below the active stages. In other cases, ion bombardment can optionally be used to prevent current spreading into the outer ridge, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cWeakly Index-Guided Interband Cascade Lasers with No Grown Top Cladding Layer or a Thin Top Cladding Layer.\u201d As noted above, by depositing the dielectric and top contact metallization on only part of the ridge, the rest can remain exposed to ambient. In still other cases, a DFB grating may also be patterned into the ridge, e.g., by etching into the III-V material or by depositing Ge and patterning the grating in the Ge. See &#39;571 patent, supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">A closely analogous embodiment can be constructed using QCL gain stages for the highly stable laser rather than ICL gain stages. For the well-known case of an InP-based QCL, the substrate is InP, the active stages typically employ strain-compensated InGaAs\u2014InAlAs quantum wells, the top and bottom cladding layers are typically n-InP, and a top and/or bottom InGaAs SCL may optionally be incorporated to maximize overlap of the optical mode with the sample gas surrounding the laser. Numerous other variations of the ridge geometry and material constituents will be obvious to one skilled in the art, and all such variations are deemed to be within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">QCLs can operate with high performance extending from MWIR wavelengths of 4 \u03bcm or shorter to LWIR wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm, and all of the embodiments of the invention discussed below that pertain to ICLs and/or ICDs apply equally to QCLs and/or QCDs operating at both MWIR and LWIR wavelengths.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate aspects of an exemplary embodiment of a highly stable laser that provides evanescent coupling of the laser beam propagating in the cavity to a sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">As seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>, a highly stable laser in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention includes a laser cavity <b>401</b> that is divided longitudinally into active and passive sections <b>413</b> and <b>414</b>, respectively, where the active waveguide section includes a narrow-ridge waveguide <b>403</b>. At each end of the laser cavity is an HR-coated cleaved facet <b>402</b> <i>a</i>/<b>402</b> <i>b</i>. In other embodiments, high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to an ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the lasing mode to a sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an exemplary configuration of the boundary between the active ICL or QCL narrow-ridge waveguide section and the passive waveguide section of a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention. While an additional reflection will occur at the boundary between the active and passive waveguide sections, due to mismatch of the modal profiles in the two sections, generally this should not seriously degrade the spectral mode selectivity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>, such an exemplary waveguide structure includes the components previously described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, including a bottom SCL <b>406</b>, ICL (or QCL) active gain stages <b>407</b>, top SCL <b>408</b>, top clad <b>409</b>, and a thin top contact layer (not shown). The active narrow-ridge waveguide shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> further includes a dielectric layer <b>411</b> on the sidewalls of the active narrow-ridge waveguide and a top metal contact layer <b>412</b> disposed on an upper surface of the top contact layer. At the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide is preferably HR-coated with a dielectric insulator and metal so that light which would otherwise be emitted into the ambient above the passive waveguide is reflected back into the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate two exemplary cross-sections of a low-loss passive waveguide section in a highly stable semiconductor laser in accordance with the present invention. These passive waveguides are formed on the same chip using the same ICL wafer material as is used for the active waveguides, with either an active or passive waveguide selected by changing the etching and other processing of a given region of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">As can be seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in exemplary embodiments, each of these passive waveguides includes an n<sup>+</sup>-GaSb substrate <b>504</b>, an n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad <b>505</b>, and a bottom GaSb SCL <b>506</b>, though other materials (superlattice or bulk materials) can be used as appropriate. The ridge for each of these passive waveguides is formed by etching away the heavily-doped top contacting layer, the top cladding layer, the top SCL, and the active gain stages, with the etch stopping near the top of the bottom SCL <b>506</b>, to provide an air top clad for the waveguide. In these embodiments, the ICL waveguide may be redesigned so that the bottom SCL is thicker than the top SCL, which can be done with only a modest reduction of the optical confinement factor for the lasing mode in the ICL. In addition, in order to avoid parasitic emission into the air above the passive waveguide due to the height and modal profile differences between the active and passive waveguides at the boundary between the active and passive waveguides, the upper portion of the active waveguide should preferably be HR coated at the interface between the active and passive waveguides.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref>, part of the InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer <b>505</b> is also removed laterally outside the ridge, with the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stopping near the top of InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom cladding layer <b>505</b>. Alternatively, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, the etch that forms the sidewalls of the passive waveguide stops within the bottom SCL <b>506</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">In both cases, the air top clad of the passive waveguide in accordance with the present invention is suitable for evanescently coupling the optical mode propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. The beam propagates in the ridge waveguide formed by the bottom n<sup>\u2212</sup>-GaSb SCL <b>506</b> as its core, the bottom superlattice cladding layer <b>505</b> (along with a portion of bottom SCL in the embodiment of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>) as its bottom clad, and air as its top clad. The top of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the sample gas or liquid. DFB gratings may be added in the active waveguide section of the cavity in a manner described below, or spectral mode selectivity may be imposed by processing DBR gratings at one or both ends of the cavity, rather than by terminating both ends of the cavity by cleaved facets with HR coatings. In either embodiment, the layer thicknesses, waveguide widths, and etch depths must be designed such that light propagating through the passive waveguide can be optically confined. In addition, in both embodiments, the tops and sides of the waveguide are suitable for evanescently coupling the propagating light to an ambient sample gas or liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">In other cases, a structure analogous to the one shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> can be used to construct a highly stable QCL in which the passive waveguide section is formed using a thick bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the InP lower cladding layer of the laser as the clad.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">Numerous variations on the waveguide geometry and material constituents for this passive waveguide will be obvious to one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide sections can be made relatively long, e.g., as long as 1 cm or more, to enhance the chemical detection sensitivity, since in most cases the passive waveguide loss will be low and absorption by the sample gas weak unless the chemical species of interest is present with a high concentration. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide extending from the gain region to the end of the cavity may follow a straight path. In other embodiments, it may follow a winding path that provides the same total passive waveguide length with greater compactness on the chip. In some embodiments, the winding or curved path of the passive waveguide may terminate at a mirror provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet as the mirror at the other end of the cavity. Embodiments in which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by termination at the same HR-coated cleaved facet will be discussed further below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">The spectral characteristics of the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity are modified by the presence or absence of a chemical species of interest. As a result, a highly stable laser in accordance with the present invention can be incorporated into a sensor to detect the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas incident on the sensor, where the presence of the gas is detected through changes in the threshold current, slope efficiency, and/or power of the highly stable laser operating in the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">In some embodiments, the presence of a chemical species in a sample gas can be detected by monitoring the compliance voltage in the I-V characteristics of the highly stable laser when a constant current is injected. See M. C. Phillips et al., \u201cIntracavity Sensing via Compliance Voltage in an External Cavity Quantum Cascade Laser,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>37, 2664 (2012). When the loss due to absorption of the laser beam by the sample gas increases, the lasing threshold increases and the radiative recombination rate decreases at a given current injection level above threshold. Therefore, a higher voltage must be applied to maintain the same current. Phillips et al., supra, observed a 0.15 V increase of the compliance voltage for a QCL emitting near 7.7 \u03bcm when the laser wavelength was swept across an absorption line of water vapor. In that experiment, the sample gas resided in an external region of the laser cavity (which also provided tuning of the laser wavelength), rather than being evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in a passive waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">Without an external cavity to tune the wavelength, the present invention can sweep across the absorption resonance by current or temperature tuning, where the dependence of compliance voltage on current is compared to that observed when the chemical species of interest is not present in the sample gas or liquid. In other embodiments, different lasers on the same chip can be tuned to different DFB or DBR wavelengths to provide a reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">The compliance voltage method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas may be combined with either evanescent coupling within the gain region, as in the case shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> with an active waveguide cross section such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, or when the waveguide in the laser cavity is divided into active and passive sections as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">For the case of an ICL, the passive waveguide could have a cross section such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. Measurement of the compliance voltage to monitor absorption by the sample gas can be applied either to ICLs or, as in the experiment reported by Phillips et al., to QCLs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">A second method for monitoring absorption by the sample gas of a laser beam propagating within a highly stable laser cavity is to incorporate an additional detector waveguide section into the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">This is shown schematically in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, a sensor in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> includes a laser cavity <b>601</b> having HR-coated end facets <b>602</b> <i>a</i>/<b>602</b> <i>b</i>, although in other embodiments high reflection is provided at both ends of the laser cavity by DBR mirrors rather than HR-coated facets. The laser cavity contains a detector waveguide section <b>615</b> on one side of an active gain waveguide <b>613</b>, with a passive sensing waveguide <b>614</b> section on the other side of the active gain waveguide, where the top surface of the passive waveguide is exposed to the ambient to provide evanescent coupling of the propagating optical mode to a sample gas or liquid as in the discussion above. In other embodiments, the detector waveguide section and the sensing waveguide section may be positioned on the same side of the active gain waveguide, rather than on opposite sides. The photocurrent measured by the detector, which may be an ICD or QCD, depends on the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity. The lasing wavelength can be tuned by varying the operating temperature, by varying the current flowing through the active gain waveguide, or by other means; in such cases, the intensity of the light propagating in the laser cavity will depend on the spectral characteristics of the absorption of the optical mode due to its evanescent coupling to the sample gas in the sensing waveguide section. The photocurrent measured by the detector will then provide information about the spectral characteristics of the absorption by the sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">In other embodiments, the detector may also be placed inside the laser cavity when evanescent coupling to the sample gas occurs within the active gain section, as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>. In such cases, the laser cavity includes an active gain waveguide section and a detector waveguide section, but no separate passive waveguide section. The active gain waveguide section and detector waveguide section must be separately contacted, with a gap in between to prevent crosstalk between the two sections. In some embodiments, a DBR may be positioned between the gain and detector sections of the waveguide to reduce the loss of the laser cavity. The DBR can cause the laser to operate in a single spectral mode, preferably with the detector waveguide extending beyond its absorption length before another reflecting element is encountered. Alternatively, if a second DBR is placed at the other end of the detector waveguide, the detector can be made to function as a resonant cavity IR detector (RCID) with the same resonance wavelength as the laser. See U.S. Pat. No. 10,297,699 to Meyer et al., entitled \u201cIn-Plane Resonant-Cavity Infrared Photodetectors with Fully-Depleted Absorbers.\u201d The opposite end of the laser cavity can be defined by an additional DBR, or by a broadband HR mirror such as a coated cleaved facet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">As noted above, both ICLs and QCLs may be operated as detectors if zero bias, a reverse bias, or a sub-threshold forward bias is applied rather than the above-threshold forward bias needed to produce lasing, with the resulting photocurrent being monitored to quantify the strength of the propagating optical signal. See Li et al., supra, and Giorgetta et al. (2007), supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">In the example of an ICL operated under forward bias to produce gain, the electron injector with chirped quantum well thicknesses transfers electrons from the semimetallic interface to the active electron quantum wells, where they recombine with holes in the active hole quantum well. In an ICD, however, electrons that are photoexcited in the active quantum wells of a given stage flow \u201cdownhill\u201d through the electron injector toward the semimetallic interface, where they recombine with photoexcited holes from the next stage. Thus, whereas a single electron injected electrically into an N-stage ICL can produce N photons, an ICD requires N photons to transfer a single electron across all the stages to provide photocurrent. The cut-off wavelength of the ICD is roughly equal to the emission wavelength of the ICL, since both are determined by the bandgap of the active quantum wells and that bandgap does not change substantially with the application of a forward or reverse bias. Whereas the photocurrent must compete with the noise induced by thermally-generated electrons that traverse the same path, a very high detectivity is not required because the detector residing inside the laser cavity experiences a high photon flux.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">However, the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity must be short enough that loss associated with absorption of the lasing photons does not seriously degrade the laser performance. To minimize the loss, it may be advantageous to apply a sub-threshold forward bias to the detector waveguide section of the cavity, which will lower the loss in the cavity while still allowing photocurrent to be generated. The advantage of lower loss must be weighed against the disadvantage that the detector noise current will be higher when a sub-threshold forward bias is applied. It may, in fact, be beneficial to monitor the detector response as a function of sub-threshold bias current.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">The operation of a quantum cascade detector is quite similar, except that intersubband absorption then provides photocurrent across the active stages when a reverse, zero, or sub-threshold forward bias is applied to the structure. In the case of a QCD, the maximum absorption in the detector waveguide section occurs at a wavelength that is noticeably longer than the same structure&#39;s QCL emission wavelength, since before absorption the electrons in thermal equilibrium or quasi-thermal equilibrium reside primarily in a subband that is about two optical phonon energies lower than the subband corresponding to the lower lasing level. The role of the lower subband is to ensure rapid depopulation of the lower lasing level following stimulated emission. In spite of this mismatch, the higher subband that contributes to absorption at the emission wavelength is sufficiently populated at room temperature for the absorption coefficient to reach several cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, according to simulations by the inventors. In many cases this will be sufficient to allow the light intensity propagating in the detector waveguide section of the laser cavity to be monitored.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">The spectral dependence of the highly stable laser intensity in the presence of evanescent coupling to a sample gas or liquid can be determined by tuning the laser wavelength with current or temperature, by using a sampled grating to increase the tuning range, see S. Kim, \u201cDesign and Analysis of Widely Tunable Sampled Grating DFB Laser Diode Integrated With Sampled Grating Distributed Bragg Reflector,\u201d <i>IEEE Phot. Tech. Lett. </i>16, 15 (2004), or by placing multiple lasers with slightly different operating wavelengths (e.g., tuned by varying the DFB or DBR grating pitch) on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">The emitter areas of a sensing chip employing any of these embodiments will be suitable for gold electro-plating above the contact metallization, to enhance the thermal dissipation for better laser and detector performance. In the case of intra-cavity evanescent coupling to the sample gas via an exposed sidewall of the laser ridge, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, epitaxial-side-down mounting for further enhancement of the thermal dissipation will be possible only if the processing provides an air pocket that allows the sample gas access to the exposed sidewall of the ridge. Since it may be quite challenging to incorporate such an air pocket, it will be more straightforward to apply epitaxial-side-down mounting to the emitter areas of embodiments that provide evanescent coupling to the sample gas via a passive waveguide section of the laser cavity, as in the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">The block schematics in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment in which this is accomplished by flip-chip bonding the active gain region of the laser cavity to a heat sink, while leaving the passive sensing waveguide section hanging over the edge of the heat sink to provide access to the sample gas. Thus, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a single chip <b>716</b> containing multiple highly stable laser cavities <b>701</b> <i>a</i>/<b>701</b> <i>b</i>, etc, each comprising active gain waveguide and passive sensing waveguide sections <b>713</b> and <b>714</b>, where the chip can be mounted epitaxial-side-down on a patterned heat sink submount <b>717</b>. After epitaxial-side-down mounting on the patterned submount, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7B</figref>, the passive sensing waveguide sections of all the laser cavities extend over the edge of the submount to provide exposure of the passive sensing waveguide sections to the ambient sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> also illustrate that the active gain waveguide sections of multiple lasers on the same chip can be epitaxial-side-down mounted in this manner, as long as they are all at the same end of the chip and the passive sensing waveguide sections at the other end of the chip can all be exposed over the edge of the mount. It may be more straightforward to mount multiple lasers on the chip epitaxial side down, while another portion of the chip hangs over the edge of the thermal mount to allow access to an ambient sample gas, when both ends of all the laser cavities terminate at the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as will be discussed below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">In some embodiments of the invention, output from the highly-stable laser is coupled into a passive waveguide, e.g., such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> for the case of an ICL PIC, for chemical sensing or some other functionality elsewhere on the PIC. In some of these embodiments, the mirror at one or both ends of the highly-stable laser cavity is formed by butt-coupling the active and passive waveguides as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>. Due to the mismatch of the modal refractive index at the interface between the two waveguide sections, part of the beam is reflected back into the laser cavity to provide feedback.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">As discussed above, a dominant contribution to the instability of semiconductor lasers is often unwanted feedback from external optical elements. This effect can be especially strong in the case of a conventional edge-emitting configuration in which the output facet of the cleaved cavity is either AR coated (reflectivity R\u22642%) or uncoated (typically R\u224825-40%). In both cases, a significant fraction of the light that is returned to the facet following reflection by an external element is transmitted back into the cavity. Therefore, suppressing the feedback from external elements can lead to a substantial enhancement of the laser stability.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">One approach to reducing the external feedback is to increase the reflectivity of the output facet to as high as about 90%. In applying this approach as well as the other embodiments discussed below, there is a trade-off between degraded stability when the reflectivity is low against lower maximum output power and efficiency when it is high. A further consideration is that the internal laser operation is more efficient when the mirrors at both ends of the cavity have high reflectivity. The cavity can then be shortened without causing excessive mirror loss, which provides a potential for substantially reducing the threshold drive power. The most straightforward approach to increasing the reflectivity at a facet while still allowing output is to deposit a multi-layer Bragg dielectric coating. However, such coatings can be expensive and challenging to apply, especially at longer wavelengths where each layer becomes proportionally thicker.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">An alternative approach to increasing the reflectivity of an output mirror is to use a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror rather than a cleaved facet to provide reflection at one or both ends of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates an exemplary first- or third-order DBR mirror <b>819</b> that defines one end of a highly stable ICL cavity having the layer structure described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>, the etch for the DBR preferably stops just above the active ICL gain stages <b>807</b>, which means that current spreading into those stages can minimize loss in the DBR section of the waveguide that does not have a top contact to provide current injection. Whereas the current injected into a conventional diode laser spreads a few microns at most, it is known that the current injected into an ICL or QCL typically spreads laterally by &gt;100 \u03bcm. See Forouhar et al., \u201cReliable Mid-Infrared Laterally-Coupled Distributed-Feedback Interband Cascade Lasers,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>105, 051110 (2014); see also U.S. Pat. No. 9,960,571, supra. Due to limitations of the practical etch depth and sidewall angle that can be achieved routinely for a given grating period when GaSb-based laser structures are processed with reactive ion etching, the processing yield is likely to be higher if a third-order grating is employed rather than a first-order grating. For the case of an exemplary ICL emitting at 3.5 \u03bcm, the grating period is then roughly 1.5 \u03bcm, and it is preferable that the grating comprise &gt;100 periods if high reflectivity is desired. An analogous DBR mirror can similarly be patterned into QCL structures. In the case of a InP- or GaAs-based QCL emitting at a wavelength beyond 4 nm, it may be practical to employ a first-order rather than third-order grating, since those material systems are less challenging to etch with steep sidewall angles, and the period also scales wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">The reflectivity of the DBR mirror can be tuned to a desired value by varying the grating length (number of periods) or the etch depth, to produce the desired trade-off between laser stability and laser power. For maximum reflection by a mirror that is not intended for output, a simulation by the inventors of the ICL structure shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref> indicates that a grating length of at least 100 \u03bcm is preferred, which with an etch depth of 1.1 \u03bcm is projected to produce a reflectivity of \u224890%. Whereas a longer grating would provide higher reflectivity, there is a limit to how far current injected from the top metal contact will spread into the DBR. Any unpumped outer portion of the DBR that does not receive very much current will be lossy, although this loss will be mitigated somewhat by self-pumping from the laser light reaching those portions of the DBR. Any loss that results will limit the maximum attainable mirror reflectivity. In some embodiments, the etched notches between the DBR teeth can be filled with a dielectric such as SiN, with a metal contact applied to the top of the DBR teeth so that current can be injected into the active stages of the DBR section of the waveguide to minimize the loss. In other embodiments, a dielectric such as SiN can be deposited over the entire top of the DBR, so that metal can be deposited on top of the dielectric for epitaxial-side-down mounting. In any embodiment for which a dielectric fills the notches in the DBR, the grating pitch must naturally be adjusted so as to account for the altered modal refractive index in the DBR section of the waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">When a DBR is used as the output mirror, its reflectivity can be adjusted for optimal trade-off between laser stability and maximum laser power, as discussed above. The beam from an ICL that includes such a DBR can be output to a passive waveguide section that begins just beyond the final DBR period. This passive waveguide can then be directed elsewhere on the chip for use in a PIC, or to an output facet for emission from the chip. In the latter case, feedback from the chip&#39;s output facet should be minimized by depositing an AR coating, and possibly also tilting the passive waveguide with respect to the output facet. When the III-V laser is integrated on a silicon PIC platform, it is relatively straightforward to provide a DBR by pre-patterning it into the silicon before the active III-V gain material is bonded and processed. See Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016, supra.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>, the DBR is formed in a passive waveguide structure such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, rather than in the full active waveguide as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>. The grating is then etched into the passive waveguide to a depth stopping within the bottom SCL layer <b>806</b> or the bottom cladding layer <b>805</b>. While there will be a greater mismatch of the mode in the laser&#39;s narrow ridge waveguide <b>803</b> and that in the passive waveguide of the DBR <b>819</b>, an advantage for some configurations is a lower loss due to removal of the active quantum wells. This may be more important in the case of an ICL rather than QCL PIC, since in the absence of a forward bias the active quantum wells in an ICL display higher optical loss.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\">In other embodiments of the invention, feedback from optical elements external to the laser cavity (residing either external to the chip or elsewhere on the chip if the laser is integrated into a PIC) is reduced to enhance the laser stability by extracting light via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide that runs parallel to the primary active gain waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, rather than the conventional extraction of light at a partially-transmissive end mirror (or alternatively, by using a second-order diffraction grating to emit light out of the plane).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> shows a cross-section of one embodiment for the two parallel waveguides at the HR-coated facet.

Both the active and passive waveguides are coated with a top metal contact layer <b>912</b>. The preferred separation between the two waveguides is \u2248300 nm to \u22482 \u03bcm, and the space between them is filled with a layer <b>911</b> <i>b </i>of a dielectric that has low loss at the emission wavelength, such as SiN in the case of the ICLs. The etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref> and in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref>, or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>.

In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, light from a laser cavity <b>1001</b> is extracted from the highly stable laser via evanescent coupling of the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1003</b> to a second (passive) waveguide <b>1014</b> that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1003</b> over some portion of the laser cavity. In the illustrated embodiment, the light coupled into the passive waveguide propagates to a third facet <b>1002</b> <i>c</i>, which is cleaved orthogonally to the two facets that define opposite ends of the laser cavity, with the light emitted from the chip via the third facet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\">Once a desired fraction of the beam has been coupled into the passive waveguide <b>1014</b>, it angles away from primary active waveguide <b>1003</b> and is directed either toward a facet <b>1002</b> <i>c </i>for emission from the chip as output <b>1021</b> (as shown in the FIGURE), or elsewhere on the chip for functionality within a PIC (not shown). In the former case, the facet at which light is emitted may be AR coated, and/or the passive waveguide may intersect the facet at a sufficiently large angle with respect to normal, as shown in the figure, that reflection at the emission facet is minimized. Reflection at the emission facet <b>1002</b> <i>c </i>would reduce the output power, and also couple reflected light back into the laser cavity <b>1001</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\">To provide single-mode operation of the highly stable laser, in some embodiments, a DFB grating may be fabricated in the active waveguide of the laser cavity, while in other embodiments, the cavity may be bounded by high-reflectivity DBRs rather than HR-coated facets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\">In still other embodiments, the highly stable laser may also be configured as an interband cascade laser (ICL) frequency comb.

In such embodiments, the laser cavity is divided into two separately-contacted sections, where one section provides gain while the other serves as a saturable absorber (SA). The SA section may be ion bombarded to shorten the carrier lifetime for faster recovery of the absorption condition, and a reverse bias may also be applied to further shorten the lifetime. That configuration can provide passive mode locking, with emission in a pulse length shorter than 1 picosecond.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a highly stable laser in which light is extracted via evanescent coupling to a second (passive) waveguide <b>1114</b> that runs parallel to the primary (active) narrow ridge waveguide <b>1103</b> over some section of the laser cavity.

In embodiments for which the mirrors defining both ends of the laser cavity are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, the bending radius should preferably be large enough that bending loss remains a small fraction of the net waveguide loss.

In both cases, gold electroplating may be applied to the active waveguide to improve heat dissipation, which optionally may be followed by epitaxial-side-down mounting to a substrate or other mount. In addition, in both cases, the output beam propagating in the passive waveguide can be directed to a facet for emission from the chip as output <b>1021</b>/<b>1121</b>, as shown in the FIGURES, or it may be directed to some other region of a PIC for on-chip chemical sensing or some other function. Although <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show the output waveguide that evanescently couples to the primary waveguide of the laser cavity to be a passive waveguide, in other cases, the output waveguide may be an active waveguide that maintains the active gain stages, top SCL, top clad, and top contact layer.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\">In the case of a highly stable QCL, the loss in the full gain region without a bias is relatively low, so the passive waveguide may optionally comprise the entire QCL structure with the same processing, ridge width, and etch depth(s) used to form the narrow ridge of the passive waveguide as was used to form the narrow ridge of the active waveguide, except that no dielectric is needed on the sidewalls, no metal is deposited on top for contacting, and no bias is applied. The loss in the passive QCL waveguide may be reduced further by ion bombardment. See U.S. Pat. No. 9,450,053 to Anish Goyal et al., entitled \u201cPhotonic Integrated Circuits Based On Quantum Cascade Structures.\u201d However, in the case of a highly stable ICL, the loss in the output waveguide will be quite high if the entire ICL gain structure is retained. Therefore, the active stages should be etched away as discussed above to form a low-loss passive waveguide such as those shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, or the entire ICL structure should be retained, including a top contact which provides a forward bias at a level high enough to reduce the loss to an acceptable level. Alternatively, an output waveguide comprising the full QCL or ICL structure can be contacted and biased above threshold to provide further amplification of the laser signal.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\">The strength of coupling between the primary and secondary waveguides may be tuned by varying the separation distance between the two waveguides, the depth of the etch in the region separating them, and/or the length over which they run in parallel. A broad range of net coupling strengths can be induced by varying one or more of these design parameters. The net coupling strength will govern the trade-off between laser stability (maximized when the coupling is weak) and maximum output power and efficiency (maximized when the coupling is strong). The maximum coupling is obtained when the region separating the active and passive waveguides is not etched at all. The inventors have simulated the coupling between active and passive waveguides, similar to those illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 2 and 5A</figref>, respectively, corresponding to a typical design for an ICL emitting at a wavelength around 3.5 \u03bcm. If both waveguides are 5 \u03bcm wide and separated by 500 nm, with no etch of the region separating them, the simulation predicts that a maximum of \u224827% of the light can be transferred from the active to the passive waveguide, which occurs over a coupling length of \u224819 \u03bcm along the longitudinal axis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\">In other embodiments, a highly stable laser may generate gain in a hybrid III-V/silicon waveguide processed on a silicon platform.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 12A-12C</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a coupling approach that is projected to transfer the beam more efficiently while maintaining highly stable laser operation. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>, QCL or ICL gain material is heterogeneously bonded to a pre-processed silicon platform to form a laser cavity with a hybrid narrow-ridge waveguide. See Spott, <i>Optica </i>2016, supra. Preferably, both ends of the laser cavity are bounded by high-reflectivity mirrors. In some embodiments, one or both high-reflectivity mirrors may be an HR-coated facet. In other embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>, the III-V ridge extends beyond both ends of the laser cavity, which is bounded and defined by two DBR mirrors <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1222</b> <i>b </i>which are patterned into the silicon before the III-V gain material is bonded thereto, where the DBR mirrors preferably induce nearly 100% reflectivity in the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\">The lasing mode resides primarily in a first III-V/silicon hybrid waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a</i>, whose silicon portion is a narrow ridge that was pre-patterned in the silicon platform before the two materials were heterogeneously bonded. Following the heterogeneous bonding, the narrow silicon ridge lies underneath the III-V ridge. It is narrower than the III-V ridge, and extends along the entire laser cavity (and beyond) along a straight path. In addition, a second pre-processed silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b</i>, which is also narrower than the III-V ridge is laterally separated from the first narrow silicon ridge by some distance and runs parallel to the first silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a </i>along some portion of the laser cavity, but at some point begins to follow an angular trajectory that finally exits the III-V mesa and the laser cavity. The second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>extends well beyond the DBR mirror <b>1222</b> <i>a </i>at a first end of the gain cavity to provide loss outside the gain cavity without inducing any parasitic reflections that can feed light back into the laser cavity. Once it has completely emerged from the III-V mesa, the second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>is a passive waveguide that provides the output of light from the integrated QCL or ICL in the form of a passive waveguide <b>1214</b>. The output light can either be emitted from the chip, or directed elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\">This structure also avoids many of the processing challenges that occur when tapers are introduced to transfer the mode between active and passive waveguides, as well as optical losses that can occur at the tapers. Furthermore, highly reflecting DBRs are straightforward to pattern in the silicon waveguide before the III-V gain material is bonded.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0123\">As in some of the embodiments discussed previously, there will be a trade-off between higher laser stability when the coupling to the emission silicon waveguide is weak, and higher power transferred to that waveguide when it is stronger. The coupling strength of the emission silicon waveguide to the lasing mode can be controlled by how close its straight portion (to the left in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>) is to the center of the optical mode profile that nominally corresponds to the middle of the III-V active mesa, as well by the length of the straight section. This straight portion precedes its angular section that leads to its departure from the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0124\">In some embodiments, silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>a </i>may be eliminated, with the optical mode at the end of the cavity that does not include the second silicon waveguide <b>1223</b> <i>b </i>(to the right in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12A</figref>) residing almost entirely in the active III-V gain material which is bounded below by air (or a dielectric). Note that this and related embodiments may provide efficient out-coupling for both QCLs and ICLs that are heterogeneously integrated with silicon.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0125\">In some embodiments of the invention, an on-chip chemical sensor is formed by coupling the highly stable laser to a sensing region that is not incorporated within the laser cavity as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\">In the subset of embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>, a portion of the lasing mode is evanescently coupled into a passive waveguide <b>1314</b> as discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>. Some section of the passive waveguide <b>1314</b> has an air top cladding, as in the configurations illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, so as to provide evanescent coupling to an ambient sample gas or liquid. The other end of the passive waveguide then couples to a detector waveguide section <b>1315</b> that also resides on the chip. The detector may be processed to have the same narrow ridge active waveguide or a similar active waveguide to the narrow ridge waveguide used in the highly-stable laser cavity. As discussed above and as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>, the detector waveguide may optionally be bounded by DBRs that cause it to function as an RCID with increased sensitivity within the linewidth of the spectral resonance. Like the narrow ridge waveguide in the laser cavity, the detector waveguide has a top electrical contact that is used to detect a photocurrent due to light propagating in the detector waveguide when it is operated at zero bias, under a reverse bias, or under a forward bias below that required to reach the lasing threshold.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\">In the case of a III-V PIC, an interband cascade detector (ICD) or quantum cascade detector (QCD) may be formed from the same active structure as the ICL or QCL source, as illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref> and as discussed above regarding the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternatively, if the PIC resides on a silicon substrate, the III-V laser and detector structures bonded to the silicon chip may be the same or different.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a sensor in which a highly stable laser <b>1301</b> in accordance with the present invention, an extended passive sensing waveguide <b>1314</b>, and an ICD/QCD <b>1315</b> all reside on the same III-V chip. In III-V PIC embodiments such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13A</figref>, the passive waveguide <b>1314</b> that provides sensing may be extended to whatever length optimizes the sensitivity of the response of the ICD/QCD <b>1315</b> to the presence of the sample gas or liquid impinging on the sensor. The path followed by the waveguide in the sensing region can be straight or, as illustrated in the FIGURE, can be circuitous, so long as the path&#39;s minimum curvature does not induce an excessive bending loss. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref> B illustrates that in some embodiments, the ICD or QCD <b>1315</b> is an in-plane resonant cavity detector that is bounded on both sides by Bragg mirrors <b>1319</b> (Meyer et al. &#39;699 patent, supra).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\">In other embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, the passive sensing waveguide may take the form of one or more ring resonators <b>1424</b> evanescently coupled to the beam propagating in the highly stable laser cavity <b>1401</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\">In such embodiments, the highly stable laser beam propagating in the laser cavity couples evanescently to a ring resonator <b>1424</b> formed by a passive waveguide whose top and/or sides are exposed to the ambient sample gas or liquid. The intensity of the light propagating in the ring is quantified by evanescently coupling the ring resonator to a waveguide <b>1414</b> that leads to a detector <b>1415</b> that absorbs the emission wavelength of the laser and resonance wavelength of the ring. As described above, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide with respect to the active waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or it may proceed partway through the bottom SCL as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. Naturally, the highly stable laser <b>1401</b> must emit at least some light at the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator, and the detector <b>1415</b> must be sensitive to light that is incident at that wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\">Evanescent coupling of the laser to the ring resonator(s) may be realized by placing one section of the ring waveguide in close proximity to the laser waveguide, or by shaping the ring as a racetrack that evanescently couples to the laser cavity over an extended length. The ring resonator <b>1424</b> may have any closed-loop shape that assures low bending loss and a high quality factor Q. Coupling to the ring resonator or to a coupled mode of two ring resonators of slightly different sizes may induce the laser to operate in a single-spectral mode, without requiring the formation of a DFB grating or DBR mirrors. Some of the present inventors previously evanescently coupled ICLs to ring resonators, which was shown to induce laser emission in a single spectral mode. See W. W. Bewley et al., \u201cSingle-Mode Interband Cascade Lasers with Coupled Ring Resonators,\u201d <i>Conference on Lasers and Electro</i>-<i>Optics </i>(2011).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, the ring also evanescently couples to a passive waveguide <b>1414</b> that leads to a detector <b>1415</b> that interrogates the intensity of the optical beam output from the ring resonator. Therefore, measuring the photocurrent flowing in the detector while the resonance wavelength of the ring resonator is varied by temperature tuning or some other means can provide information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas or liquid. Furthermore, multiple ring resonators with different resonance wavelengths, along with detectors associated with each ring resonator, can provide information over a broader spectral range. If the sample gas contains a chemical species that absorbs light at the ring&#39;s resonance wavelength, the output from the ring is reduced by an amount related to the concentration of the absorbing gas species. The net absorption by the gas is enhanced significantly by the many round-trip passes through the high-Q ring cavity. The resonance wavelength of the ring may be tuned to coincide with an absorption feature of a given chemical species by varying the temperature of the sensing area, which in some embodiments may be controlled separately from the temperatures of the source and detector. If no chemical species in the sample gas absorbs at a resonance wavelength within the range that is scanned when the temperature is varied, the detected signal should not vary appreciably with resonance wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\">In both of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, a passive connecting waveguide, which for an ICL PIC consists only of the core and cladding layers as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>, butt-couples directly to the detector waveguide that contains the full ICD or QCD structure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\">If the platform is a III-V PIC, the detector is an ICD or QCD formed from the same wafer material as the laser. In other embodiments, the platform may be formed from a different III-V material if multiple III-V active components are bonded to a common silicon PIC platform for coupling to silicon passive waveguides that form the ring resonator and passive connecting waveguides. Again, the detector may employ an unpatterned active waveguide, or function as an RCID for higher sensitivity if both boundaries of the absorber are bounded by DBRs as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15A</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which the optical mode propagating in a passive waveguide <b>1514</b> evanescently couples to an adjacent detector waveguide <b>1515</b>, which is also shown in greater detail in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15B</figref>. The geometry of the two waveguides is entirely analogous to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, which evanescently couples light propagating in the primary waveguide of a laser cavity to the secondary passive waveguide. In the case of evanescent coupling of the passive waveguide to a detector, the coupling strength should be maximized to the extent possible. With sufficient parallel coupling pathlength, nearly half the light can be transferred to the detector waveguide. In some embodiments, the passive waveguide that runs parallel to the detector waveguide may be bounded by DBRs that maximize the coupling strength for light at the resonant wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0136\">To use the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13-15</figref> for on-chip spectroscopic sensing, the laser drive current and/or the temperature of the chip or some portion of the chip may be varied so as to tune the laser wavelength and/or ring resonance wavelength across a narrow fingerprint absorption feature of a given chemical species that may be present in the sample gas. To probe the optical absorption by the sample gas over a broader range of wavelengths, the highly stable laser may be configured as a sampled grating laser whose emission wavelength can be tuned over the entire spectral bandwidth of the gain material. See Kim et al., supra. A given thermal shift of the refractive index of the gain and/or ring resonator material then induces a larger tuning range than can be obtained by tuning a single optical mode.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\">In other embodiments, current may be injected into the emitter waveguide at a level below the lasing threshold, so that it functions as a light emitting device (LED) or amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) device with emission extending over a broader spectral band (much broader in the case of the LED). In those embodiments, a ring resonator waveguide that evanescently couples to the sample gas, and/or the resonance wavelength of an RCID formed by placing DBRs at each end of the detector&#39;s absorber waveguide, may filter the broadband output of the emitter to allow the spectral dependence of absorption by the sample gas to be determined on a much finer wavelength scale.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0138\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which a single LED, ASE, or tunable ICL or QCL source <b>1625</b> emits into a passive bus waveguide <b>1614</b>, and then a series of single or coupled ring resonators <b>1624</b> <i>a/b/c/d . . . n</i>, each of which is tuned to a different resonance wavelength, evanescently couples to the same passive bus waveguide. The passive waveguides used for the bus, ring resonators, and connectors leading to the detectors may be formed from the lower SCL of the laser structure as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0139\">Each ring in the series selectively extracts its own resonance wavelength from the bus to allow the spectral dependence of the absorption to be determined. Each ring also couples into a passive waveguide <b>1614</b>/<i>a/b</i>/ . . . , which in turn couples into to a corresponding ICD or QCD <b>1615</b> <i>a/b/c/d . . . n</i>, whose absorber waveguide section may optionally be bound at both ends by DBRs to form an RCID. This is analogous to an embodiment described by the inventors of the present invention in U.S. Pat. No. 10,333,011 supra except that the &#39;011 patent described an on-chip chemical sensor residing on a silicon platform, with silicon-based passive bus, ring resonator, and connecting waveguides, whereas the on-chip sensor illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref> instead incorporates the entire chemical sensing system on a III-V PIC chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0140\">In other embodiments of the invention, multiple on-chip sensors, each operating at a different resonance wavelength, are integrated onto the same III-V PIC. The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which each in a series of ring resonators <b>1724</b> <i>a/b/c </i>. . . (or ring resonator pairs) evanescently couples to its own corresponding highly stable laser or broadband optical source with corresponding narrow-ridge waveguides <b>1703</b> <i>a/b/c </i>. . . , in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>. Each ring resonator is exposed to the sample gas and couples to an ICD or QCD <b>1715</b> <i>a/b/c </i>. . . that measures the beam intensity at the resonance wavelength of the given sensing element. Although three sensing elements operating at three different resonance wavelengths \u03bb<sub>1</sub>, \u03bb<sub>2</sub>, and \u03bb<sub>3 </sub>are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>, any number sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0141\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment in which multiple extended passive sensing waveguides <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c </i>reside on the same chip in a manner analogous to the single-element sensor embodiment described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>. In this embodiment, emission from each of an array of highly stable laser cavities <b>1801</b> <i>a/b/c </i>(or broadband LEDs or ASE sources) is input into a corresponding extended passive waveguide <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c</i>, etc., where the passive waveguides have air top claddings that allow evanescent coupling to the sample gas. Corresponding ICDs or QCDs <b>1815</b> <i>a/b/c </i>that are coupled to each extended passive sensing waveguide <b>1814</b> <i>a/b/c </i>measure the signal traversing the full length of each such passive waveguide, with each sensing element operating independently of the others. Again, although three independent sensing elements operating at three different wavelengths are illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>, any number of sensing elements may be integrated on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0142\">In this case, spectroscopic information is obtained by varying the DFB or DBR grating period to tune each individual single-spectral-mode laser <b>1801</b> <i>a/b/c </i>to a different emission wavelength, or by employing broadband sources and varying the resonance wavelength of an RCID <b>1815</b>/<i>a/b/c </i>that measures the intensity of the optical beam transmitted by the extended passive sensing waveguide. When multiple sensors operating at different resonance wavelengths are employed on the same chip, the different sensors can be tuned to wavelengths on and off the spectral fingerprint features of a given chemical, to several representative wavelengths that provide additional spectral details, or to use the same chip for detecting multiple chemical species. Fine-tuning of the sensing element resonance wavelengths can be implemented by locally or globally controlling the temperature on the chip, or by varying the current injected into each given laser source.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0143\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates that in some embodiments, the top of the passive waveguide in the sensing region can be coated by a chemical sorbent <b>1926</b> which can adsorb the molecules of certain classes of chemicals, thereby placing them in the immediate vicinity of the propagating light beam and enhancing their molecular concentration by orders of magnitude. See, e.g., T. H. Stievater et al., \u201cMicromechanical Photothermal Spectroscopy of Trace Gases Using Functionalized Polymers,\u201d Opt. Lett. 37, 2328 (2012).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0144\">Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref>, the passive waveguide in such a case can include a GaSb substrate <b>1904</b>, a n-InAs/AlSb superlattice bottom clad layer <b>1905</b>, and a bottom GaSb SCL <b>1906</b>. Sorbent layer <b>1926</b> covers all of the SCL <b>1906</b> and the upper surface of the bottom clad layer <b>1905</b>, with the thickness of the sorbent coating preferably matching the vertical extent of the optical mode propagating in the passive waveguide. As in the other cases described herein, the etch that defines the lateral boundaries of the passive waveguide may proceed through the entire bottom SCL, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> and in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or it may proceed only partway through the bottom SCL, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref>. In addition, although <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a case where the chemical sorbent is deposited on a passive waveguide processed on an ICL chip, in other embodiments the sorbent may be deposited on the passive waveguides on a QCL PIC chip, or on passive silicon waveguides.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0145\">As noted above, the cavity of a highly stable ICL may be configured with gain and saturable absorber sections so that it is passively mode locked and produces short pulses that appear as a frequency comb in the spectral domain, as was recently demonstrated in Bagheri et al. supra. Since the comb stability is often a primary factor limiting the detection sensitivity of dual-comb spectroscopy, it will be advantageous to exploit the greater stability provided by the architectural embodiments of the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0146\">Thus, in some embodiments, both end mirrors of the highly stable frequency comb ICL are defined by HR-coated cleaved facets, and the laser output is obtained via evanescent coupling to a secondary passive waveguide. This is directly analogous to the configurations illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9, 11, and 15</figref> for highly stable lasers that are not frequency combs, except that the cavity for the frequency comb laser is divided into gain and saturable absorber sections. As in the case of a highly stable non-frequency-comb laser, the laser cavity in a highly stable frequency-comb laser (ICL or QCL) can also be defined by an etched facet or a DBR mirror at one or both ends of the cavity. The output of such a highly stable frequency comb laser can be emitted from the chip, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, or it may be directed via the passive waveguide to some other region of the chip for functionality in a PIC as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>. For example, one or more highly stable frequency comb ICL(s) may be used as the source(s) for an on-chip chemical sensing system.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0148\" num=\"0147\">In particular, two highly stable frequency combs may be employed on the same chip as sources for fully integrated on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy. See, e.g., L. A. Sterczewski et al., \u201cMid-Infrared Dual-Comb Spectroscopy with Low Drive-Power On-Chip Sources,\u201d <i>Opt. Lett. </i>44, 2113 (2019). Dual-comb spectroscopy is known to offer high spectral resolution over a broad spectral bandwidth, combined with a very short acquisition time on the order of milliseconds. See, e.g., G. Villares et al., \u201cDual-Comb Spectroscopy Based on Quantum-Cascade-Laser Frequency Combs,\u201d <i>Nature Commun. </i>5, 6192 (2014). In dual-comb spectroscopy, information about the absorption spectrum of the sample gas is obtained by using a fast detector to observe the multi-heterodyne beating of two frequency combs that have slightly different comb spacings (determined by the cavity length), so as to generate a direct link between the optical and RF domains. The beam from one of the combs interrogates the sample gas, whereas the other comb functions as a local oscillator whose beam does not come into contact with the sample gas. Both transmitted beams then coupled into the same on-chip ICD or QCD, whose output is input to an RF spectrum analyzer. Since a fast detector is required for rapid sensing measurement speed, it is advantageous that both ICDs and QCDs have displayed 3-dB bandwidths of up to 1 GHz and above. See H. Lotfi et al., \u201cHigh-Frequency Operation of a Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade System at Room Temperature,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>108, 201101 (2016); and F. R.

As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, in this embodiment, the two ICL frequency comb lasers with slightly different comb spacings are situated at the same end of the chip to allow both to be mounted epitaxial-side-down, while the extended passive waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>a </i>of the sensing region hangs over the edge of the mount to provide contact with the ambient sample gas. Both ends of each laser cavity are highly reflective, e.g., from a combination of HR-coated cleaved facets, HR-coated etched facets, and/or DBR mirrors, although this embodiment does not allow either frequency comb laser to be bounded on both sides by HR-coated cleaved facets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0149\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, each of the frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b </i>(described herein as being ICLs, though QCLs can also be used) evanescently couples to a secondary passive waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>a/b </i>that runs parallel to the active waveguide over some section of the laser cavity, as described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. However, in other embodiments the output from one or both frequency comb ICLs may couple to its corresponding passive waveguide by butt-coupling the passive waveguide to a DBR mirror that defines the output end of the laser cavity. The output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2001</b> <i>a </i>couples to an extended passive sensing waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>a</i>, whose top surface is exposed to ambient to allow evanescent coupling of the propagating beam to the ambient sample gas. Absorption by the sample gas then affects the spectral dependence of the light signal reaching the detector following traversal of the extended passive sensing waveguide. The extended passive sensing waveguide, in turn, couples to the input of an on-chip ICD <b>2015</b>. The output from the second highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2001</b> <i>b </i>(the local oscillator) evanescently couples to a second, much shorter passive waveguide <b>2014</b> <i>b </i>that proceeds directly to the same ICD <b>2015</b>. The signal transmitted by the second passive waveguide is not affected significantly by exposure to the sample gas, partly due to its much shorter length, and in some embodiments also because the second passive waveguide is encapsulated so as to prevent its propagating optical mode from coupling to the sample gas.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0150\">The two passive waveguides shown in this figure are coupled to the same ICD by a Y-Junction, whose single output passive waveguide butt-couples to the ICD.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0151\">In an alternative embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, the input passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>can evanescently couple to the two sides of an ICD or QCD <b>2115</b> rather than coupling to the detector via a Y-junction as in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>. In still other embodiments, the passive waveguides can be combined by an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) or some other means known to the art before the combined beams are coupled to the ICD or QCD. The combined photocurrent signal measured by the fast ICD due to both transmitted beams is input to an RF spectrum analyzer that determines the multi-heterodyne beating of the two ICL frequency combs with slightly different comb spacings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0152\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, two frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b</i>, each having a gain section <b>2128</b> <i>a/b </i>and a saturable absorber section <b>2129</b> <i>a/b</i>, and each having a slightly different comb spacing, are used. In this embodiment the cavity for each of the two frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b </i>is formed from a waveguide containing curved sections to form a laser cavity terminated at both ends at the same HR-coated cleaved facet <b>2102</b>, by analogy to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref> for a single laser, so that the same HR-coated cleaved facet provides both end mirrors for each of the two highly stable frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b</i>. Both lasers can then reside at one end of the chip, while the extended passive sensing waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>a</i>, the shorter passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>b</i>, and the ICD <b>2115</b> can reside at the other end, so as to allow both frequency comb lasers to be mounted epitaxial side down while the extended passive sensing waveguide hangs over the edge of the mount to allow evanescent coupling of its top surface to the ambient sample gas. This configuration has the advantage that the common HR-coated cleaved facet, which provides both end mirrors for both frequency comb lasers, is generally much easier to process with high yield, using standard procedures, than an HR-coated etched mirror or a DBR.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0153\">As in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, in this embodiment, the output from the first highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2101</b> <i>a </i>couples to an extended passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>a </i>that evanescently couples to the sample gas, followed by input to the ICD <b>2115</b>. The second highly stable frequency comb ICL <b>2101</b> <i>b </i>couples to a passive waveguide <b>2114</b> <i>b </i>that leads directly to the same ICD <b>2115</b> without interacting with the sample gas, or its interaction is over a very short path length.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0154\">In addition, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, both passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>run parallel to an active waveguide in the ICD for some distance to allow transfer of the input beams to the detector waveguide. As in the case of embodiments where a single input waveguide couples to the detector evanescently, the embodiment that evanescently couples two input waveguides has the advantage of greater laser stability, because much lower fractions of the incoming beams are reflected back into the passive waveguides for unwanted feedback into the two lasers. However, a Y-Junction (as in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>) or some other means known to the art may alternatively be used to couple both beams into the same ICD.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0156\" num=\"0155\">In all of the on-chip dual-comb sensing embodiments, such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the extended waveguide that provides evanescent coupling to the sample gas can be coated with a chemical sorbent that concentrates the molecules of interest so as to substantially increase the absorption due to those molecules.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0157\" num=\"0156\">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, a DFB ICL seed laser <b>2101</b>-seed provides input to both combs, via passive waveguides <b>2101</b> <i>c/d</i>, to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers <b>2101</b> <i>a/b </i>that reside on each side of the DFB laser <b>2101</b>-seed. The incorporation of a seed laser such as that shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref> is optional for operation of the on-chip dual-comb spectroscopy system of the invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0158\" num=\"0157\">The block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates an exemplary PIC embodiment that employs a DFB ICL seed laser <b>2201</b>-seed to lock the frequencies of two frequency combs. The DFB ICL that resides between the two combs operates in a single spectral mode that is preferably near the center of the gain spectra of the two ICL frequency comb lasers <b>2001</b> <i>a/b </i>that reside on each side of the DFB laser <b>2201</b>-seed. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref>, similar to the manner described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref>, both end mirrors for all three lasers are provided by the same HR-coated cleaved facet, although numerous other geometries are possible while maintaining the same inventive design aspects, such as bounding one or both ends of one or more of the laser cavities by DBR or etched mirrors. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 22</figref>, two passive waveguides <b>2214</b> <i>a </i>and <b>2214</b> <i>b </i>are evanescently coupled to the active waveguide of the DFB ICL at each end of its cavity. Each of those passive waveguides <b>2114</b> <i>a/b </i>then couples light from the DFB ICL to each of the frequency comb ICLs <b>2001</b> <i>a/b</i>, which may have the effect of locking them to the DFB emission wavelength, provided that wavelength is sufficiently close to one of the teeth of the frequency combs. The two comb outputs may either be emitted from the chip, e.g., at one of the end facets, or be evanescently coupled into output waveguides <b>2214</b> <i>a/b </i>to be used elsewhere on the chip for functionality in a III-V or silicon PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0159\" num=\"0158\">Other embodiments of III-V PICs designed in accordance with the invention may provide on-chip spectral beam combining to scale the laser power that can be output into a single high-quality beam, as illustrated by the block schematic in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 23</figref>. In this embodiment, a QCL or ICL array <b>2331</b> of DFB or DBR lasers is patterned to have slightly different grating pitches so that each laser emits at a slightly different wavelength. The outputs from the lasers in the array can be butt-coupled to passive waveguides <b>2314</b> <i>a/b</i>/ . . . designed and processed in accordance with the invention (e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5A</figref> or <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5B</figref> in the case of an ICL), with partially-reflecting DBRs. In other embodiments, the refractive index mismatch at the interface between the active and passive waveguides, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref>, defines one end mirror for each laser cavity. The outputs from the various array elements emitting at different wavelengths may then be input to an AWG <b>2332</b> for spectral beam combining into a single output waveguide <b>2314</b>-out. The array output with much higher power than each individual array element is then emitted from the chip at a single waveguide aperture <b>2333</b>. Processing protocols for mounting such an array epitaxial side down are well known to the art.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0159\">In some embodiments, the same highly-stable laser cavity evanescently couples to two different passive waveguides. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24A</figref>, the two passive waveguides <b>2414</b> <i>a/b </i>run in parallel to the laser cavity <b>2401</b> for evanescent coupling on the same side of the laser ridge but at opposite ends of the cavity. Alternatively, for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24B</figref> the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at the same end of the cavity, while in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24C</figref> the two passive waveguides couple to opposite sides of the laser ridge at opposite ends of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0160\">In all of these embodiments, both passive waveguides have the same extended length with the same shape, and at the opposite end both couple to ICDs or QCDs integrated on the chip. However, one extended passive waveguide is exposed to the sample gas while the other serves as a reference because it is not exposed. For example, exposure of the reference extended waveguide to the sample gas can be prevented by encapsulating that portion of the chip in a hermetic dome that the sample gas does not penetrate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0161\">All of these embodiments have the advantage of providing a reference signal that propagates through the same length and shape of waveguide for detection by an identical ICD or QCD that nominally operates at the same temperature due to its close proximity on the chip, but which is not attenuated by absorption associated with trace chemicals in the sample gas. The extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>a </i>that is exposed to the sample gas may be covered with a sorbent to enhance the concentration of trace chemicals of interest. In that case, the signal detected for the extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>a </i>coated with the sorbent may be compared to the signal for a reference extended waveguide <b>2414</b> <i>b </i>that is not coated with the sorbent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0162\">In some embodiments, multi-spectral detection is obtained by positioning multiple in-plane interband or quantum cascade resonant cavity infrared detectors with different resonance wavelengths along a single multi-spectral detection waveguide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0163\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a chemical sensing PIC that integrates on the same III-V or silicon chip a highly stable laser cavity <b>2501</b>, an extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b> whose top surface is exposed to a sample gas, and a series of multi-wavelength RCIDs <b>2515</b> <i>a/b</i>/ . . . that are positioned in series along the same multi-spectral detection waveguide <b>2534</b>, which receives the optical signal transmitted by the extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b>. A DBR mirror <b>2519</b> is positioned on each side of each detector in the multi-spectral series of detectors, with each set of two such DBR mirrors that bound a given RCID is formed by etching gratings with a different pitch than the gratings that form the two DBRs that bound any other RCID in the series, so that each RCID in the series operates at a different resonance wavelength. Preferably, each RCID, consisting of the detector <b>2515</b> and DBR mirrors <b>2519</b>, butt-couples to the next, with no space between the grating for one DBR with a given grating pitch and the grating for the next DBR with a different grating pitch.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0164\">In the case of an ICD RCID, it may be preferable to etch the grating into the passive waveguide structure, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8B</figref>, rather than into the full waveguide structure as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8A</figref>. This is because optical loss due to absorption in the active quantum wells can degrade the quality factor of the RCID cavities if the DBRs are formed by etching the grating into the full active structure. The absorption loss in the active quantum wells is of less concern for a QCD RCID, particularly if the DBRs are ion bombarded to trap free carriers and further reduce the loss as discussed above.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0165\">The photocurrent flowing in any given RCID is sensitive primarily to incoming light having a wavelength falling within one linewidth of the resonance wavelength of that RCID, whereas most of the incoming optical signal that does not fall within the narrow spectral linewidth of that RCID is transmitted to the next RCID, since the DBR mirrors do not provide high reflection of any non-resonance wavelength, and the longitudinal length L of the absorber in each RCID is short enough that only a small fraction of the beam is absorbed during a single pass through the absorber. However, most of the spectral component of the incoming optical signal that falls within the narrow spectral linewidth of the given RCID is absorbed, since the quality factor Q of the cavity defined by the two DBRs on each side of the RCID, in combination with the longitudinal pathlength L of the absorber for that RCID, provide high absorption quantum efficiency following multiple longitudinal passes of the selected spectral portion of the beam through the RCID. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25</figref>, the multi-spectral detection waveguide <b>2534</b> terminates at an HR-coated facet <b>2502</b>, or some other broadband mirror that provides a second pass of the optical signal through the multi-spectral series of RCIDs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0166\">Each RCID in the series has a separate top contact that allows the photocurrent generated by the portion of the incoming signal falling within the selected spectral bandwidth of the given RCID to be measured. In some embodiments of a III-V PIC, the circuit is completed by a common ground contact to the substrate side of the chip, which also provides a common ground contact for all the interband or quantum cascade optical emitters on the chip. In the case of a silicon PIC, both contacts to the interband or quantum cascade RCID must be processed on the top side of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0167\">By tuning each RCID to a different resonance wavelength, via the grating pitch of the DBRs surrounding that RCID, the intensity of the incoming signal can be measured as a function of wavelength. Combining the information received from the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series then provides a spectral characterization of the incoming signal. The spectral bandwidths of the different RCIDs in the multi-spectral series may be designed to nearly overlap, so that a continuous spectrum can be obtained, or the resonances for the different RCIDs may be selected to detect a pre-determined set of non-contiguous wavelengths of interest.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0168\">If the chemical sensing PIC employs an source with broad spectral bandwidth, such as an infrared light emitting diode (LED) such as the interband cascade LED (see C. S. Kim et al., <i>Opt. Engr. </i>57, 011002 (2018), \u201cImproved Mid-Infrared Interband Cascade Light Emitting Devices\u201d), an infrared amplified spontaneous emission device (e.g., M. C. Zheng et al., Opt. Expr. <b>23</b>, <b>2713</b>, \u201cHigh power spiral cavity quantum cascade superluminescent emitter\u201d), or simply an ICL or QCL, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs can be used as the primary means for determining the spectrum for optical transmission through the extended passive waveguide <b>2514</b>. This approach may sometimes be more straightforward to implement than the series of ring resonators that is employed to provide spectral information for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. An advantage of employing a silicon PIC to implement the multi-spectral series of detectors is that DBRs with low loss and high Q may be more straightforward to process with high yield (Spott, <i>Photonics </i>2016 supra) than is possible with DBRs processed on a III-V PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0169\">More generally, the multi-spectral series of RCIDs may be used to provide multi-spectral detection of any signal propagating in an incoming passive waveguide. For example, it may be used for multi-spectral or hyper-spectral detection or imaging that on a PIC that does not integrate optical sources on the same chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0170\">Numerous variations on the inventive embodiments described above are possible. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3, 5, and 19</figref> illustrate specific passive and active waveguide configurations that provide evanescent coupling of the beam propagating in the waveguide to an ambient sample gas. A variety of alternative designs for both the semiconductor layering design and the passive waveguide profile will be obvious to one skilled in the art. For example, starting with a QCL III-V epitaxial structure a passive waveguide may be constructed with a bottom InGaAs SCL as the core and the bottom InP cladding layer as the bottom clad of the passive waveguide. The InGaAs bottom SCL thickness should be designed for optimal operation of both the highly stable QCL and the passive waveguide. It was mentioned above that ion bombardment of the passive or active waveguide on a QCL chip may deplete the free electrons so as to further reduce the waveguide loss. QCL chips designed for LWIR operation can be used to expand the spectral coverage of III-V PICs incorporating QCLs and QCDs to on-chip chemical sensors probing wavelengths beyond 10 \u03bcm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0171\">When the laser output is emitted from the chip (e.g., as in the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>), the advantageous enhanced stability that is realized when only a small fraction of the power is coupled out of the cavity per pass may be applied to diode lasers operating on any III-V substrate and emitting at any wavelength. This includes near-IR, visible, and ultraviolet diode lasers that may reside on InP, GaAs, GaN, or other III-V substrates, for which passive waveguides may be designed for compatibility with the given laser structure. While a similar enhancement of the laser stability may be induced by applying an HR coating to the output facet defining one end of the laser cavity, the invention&#39;s evanescently-coupled output from the side of the laser cavity provides simpler processing as well as much greater control over the out-coupling fraction per pass (via the double-waveguide profile, the spacer width between the two waveguides, and the distance over which the two waveguides propagate parallel to one another).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0172\">In some embodiments, both ends of the highly stable laser cavity are bounded by HR-coated facets that do not provide any significant spectral selectivity. The two mirrors at opposite ends of the laser cavity may be formed by two facets cleaved on opposite ends of a chip, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref>, by two mirrors located on the same cleaved facet as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>, or by etching an HR-coated facet to form at least one of the mirrors. In the embodiments of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, some fraction of the light is evanescently coupled to a second waveguide that is passive, although in other embodiments the second active waveguide may be active in order to minimize loss (if biased below the gain threshold) or provide further amplification of the optical signal (if biased above the gain threshold).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0173\">In other embodiments, a DBR mirror defines at least one end of the highly stable laser. Some fraction of the light can then couple into a passive or active output waveguide that emerges from the opposite end of the partially-reflecting DBR mirror, as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>. Both out-coupling via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide and out-coupling at a DBR mirror provide flexibility in the trade between laser stability and out-coupling efficiency. In the case of evanescent out-coupling to a second waveguide, the fraction of light in the laser cavity that is out-coupled per pass depends on the coupling strength between the two waveguides, which may be varied through adjustment of their separation distance and waveguide profiles. In the alternative case of out-coupling from a partially-reflecting DBR mirror that defines one end of the laser cavity, the etch depth and number of periods may be tuned to adjust the mirror reflectivity. It may be more straightforward to realize a broad range of out-coupling efficiencies when the DBR mirror approach is employed. In terms of positioning it is also more flexible to define the laser cavity by DBR mirrors, since the laser can then be placed anywhere within a PIC, whereas defining the cavity with one or more HR-coated cleaved facets requires that the laser be proximate to one or more boundaries of the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0174\">In many embodiments, such as when stable output into a single spectral mode is desired, these two approaches to out-coupling may be used interchangeably. Which is preferable for use in a given PIC may depend in part on whether it is more straightforward to process a DBR or a double waveguide with separation close enough to provide substantial evanescent coupling. In the latter case, the laser cavity must also incorporate a DFB grating or other means of longitudinal mode selection if lasing in a single spectral mode is required. Which architecture is less challenging to fabricate with higher yield will depend in part on the material constituents, and also on the profiles and dimensions of the waveguides. However, in cases where lasing should not occur in a single spectral mode, e.g., when the laser is a frequency comb, a DBR mirror cannot be used to define either end of the laser cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0175\">In some embodiments, the laser source emits in a narrow spectral linewidth due to the implementation of a DFB grating. One or both ends of the cavity are then defined by DBR mirrors or some other means known to the art. In some embodiments, the narrow-linewidth emission wavelength may be tuned over some limited bandwidth by current, temperature, or some other means such as a sampled grating. The spectral bandwidth can be extended by disposing multiple laser sources on the same chip, which are coupled to multiple sensing regions, or by coupling a single laser source to multiple resonant cavities as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>. Alternatively, the on-chip IR source may be a broadband emitter such as an LED or ASE source rather than a laser operating with a narrow spectral linewidth.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0176\">The sensing region may consist of an extended passive waveguide, or it may take the form of a ring or other high-Q resonator (or coupled pairs of such resonators) that substantially extend the effective path length for sensing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0177\">The on-chip detector may be an ICD or QCD formed on the same III-V chip from the same epitaxial structure as the laser, or it may be formed from a different III-V, II-VI, or IV-VI active detector material bonded to the same silicon platform as the laser, or it may be an in-plane silicon bolometer processed as part of a silicon PIC. In the case of an ICD or QCD detector, the photocurrent may be collected at zero bias, at a reverse bias, or at a forward bias below the lasing threshold. The latter may be advantageous, for example, to minimize the loss induced by a detector integrated into the laser cavity as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. The absorber region of the detector may be placed within a resonant cavity for operation as a resonant cavity infrared detector by processing DBR mirrors at both ends of the absorber region.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0178\">By combining these options for the MWIR optical source, the sensing region, and the detector, the spectral dependence of the absorption by the sample gas may be determined by tuning the resonance wavelength of the source, the sensing region if it incorporates a resonant cavity, or the detector. If more than one of these operates in a narrow spectral band, the resonance wavelengths must be matched by careful design and calibration, independent temperature tuning of the different regions, or some other means. Spectral information may also be obtained by combining multiple sensors on the same chip, with each operating at a different wavelength.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0179\">Many of the embodiments disclosed above apply equally to PICs integrated on either a III-V or silicon substrate, while others are only advantageous when applied to III-V PICs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0180\">Some aspects of the invention may be advantageous even if an entire chemical sensing system is not integrated on the same III-V or silicon chip. For example, one or more highly stable laser sources and passive sensing waveguides in accordance with the invention may be combined on a III-V or silicon chip, in conjunction with coupling into one or more detectors that reside off the chip. Or similarly, one or more off-chip optical sources may be used in conjunction with one or more passive waveguide sensing areas and one or more infrared detectors residing on the chip.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0181\">While the descriptions of the invention as applied to MWIR and LWIR PICs have assumed laser sources based on either type-II GaSb-based ICL structures or InP-based QCL structures, the invention applies equally to other cascade laser structures. These include type-I ICLs that may similarly function as ICDs when operated at zero bias, ICLs grown on InAs substrates, and QCLs grown on GaAs, InAs, GaSb, GaN, or silicon substrates. See, e.g., L. Shterengas et al., \u201cType-I Quantum Well Cascade Diode Lasers Emitting Near 3 \u03bcm,\u201d <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>103, 121108 (2013).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\">The in-plane waveguides in which the optical signals propagate may be formed entirely within the III-V semiconductor from which the active detector layers are formed, or by depositing or bonding to some other material to form the core and/or clad for a waveguide. For example, chalcogenide materials may be deposited and patterned to form waveguides within a III-V or silicon PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\">Advantages and New Features</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\">A III-V or Si PIC designed for chemical sensing that is based on any of the embodiments described in this invention will be suitable for mass production of hundreds of chemical sensors on the same chip. The individual sensors can then be singulated to form the basis for a package that is both extremely compact and inexpensive.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\">A primary advantage of most of the disclosed embodiments is the high stability of the laser source or multiple laser sources used therein, which is accomplished by isolating the laser(s) to the maximum degree possible from any interactions with optical elements external to the laser cavity or with other optical elements in a PIC. Rather than coupling a substantial fraction of the laser power out of the cavity or elsewhere on the chip at some point during each pass through the cavity, the cavity is formed by two HR mirrors that are independent of the light extraction so that only a small, adjustable fraction of the power is extracted during each pass through the cavity via evanescent coupling to a passive waveguide. While the maximum output power and power conversion efficiency may in some cases be reduced somewhat, the threshold current and threshold drive power are minimized by the substantial reduction of loss at the output mirror, as well as by the potential for reducing the cavity length (e.g., to &lt;&lt;1 mm) if the mirror loss can be minimized. The laser&#39;s increased stability and reduced drive power may be exploited in configurations that emit the beam from the chip for use in an external system, or as an optical source component of a PIC.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\">The invention also provides a framework for constructing fully integrated photonic integrated circuits, and especially for creating III-V PICs on the native substrates of interband and quantum cascade laser structures. A III-V PIC designed in accordance with the invention will be much simpler and less expensive to process with high yield than a Si-based PIC that integrates multiple III-V active components. The numerous optical elements that may be incorporated into a single III-V PIC include lasers, detectors, passive waveguides, sensing waveguides that evanescently couple to an ambient sample gas, and arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) for spectral beam combining and separating.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\">The present invention can be utilized for any one or more of these configurations. For example, the invention may be used to construct an ultra-compact chemical sensing system that combines one or more ICL or QCL sources, one or more ICDs or QCDs, passive sensing waveguides, and passive connecting waveguides, all on the same III-V chip. In some embodiments, the invention can provide a chemical sensing system based on dual-comb spectroscopy that employs two highly stable ICL frequency combs integrated on the same chip with a passive sensing waveguide and ICD. PICs incorporating various ICL/ICD and QCL/QCD designs can provide on-chip chemical sensors designed for highly stable room-temperature cw operation at wavelengths from &lt;2.5 \u03bcm to &gt;11 \u03bcm. In fact, it should be possible to extend this range to longer wavelengths, since a QCL emitting at a given wavelength may be expected to operate to a somewhat higher temperature when both ends of the laser cavity are defined by HR mirrors, as in many embodiments of the invention, than for a conventional design having an HR mirror at only one end of the cavity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\">Although the present disclosure describes and illustrates various specific embodiments, aspects, and features, one skilled in the art would readily appreciate that the invention described herein is not limited to only the described embodiments, aspects, and features but also contemplates any and all modifications and alternative embodiments that are within the spirit and scope of the underlying invention described and claimed herein.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \\n     This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 119 to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/470,053, filed on Mar. 10, 2017, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \\n    \\n    \\n     DESCRIPTION \\n     Technical Field \\n     The disclosed embodiments generally relate to the capturing of images and lasering of images on transaction cards using a vector image format. The disclosed embodiments also generally relate to electronically verifying visible information entered into a point-of-service terminal with a scalable vector image file representing the visible information stored for a transaction card. \\n     Background \\n     Transaction cards, such as credit and debit cards, have become a primary means for individuals to complete transactions involving data exchange. Traditional transaction cards are constructed in a sheeted laminate press. The shape of the card is die cut, and then, the card is personalized. Typically, transaction cards are cut from laminated sheets of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), or other similar materials. After the overall shape of the card is formed, the card may be modified to add functional and/or visible features. For example, a magnetic stripe and/or microchip may be affixed to one side, the card may be stamped with the card number and customer name, and color(s) or a design may be added for appearance. \\n     As a fraud prevention measure, such cards may be provided with a signature specimen, such that a vendor relying on the card for some aspect of a transaction, can authenticate that the person presenting the card is the actual authorized user of the card based on a comparison of a fresh signature provided at presentation with a signature specimen available on the card. Traditional signature specimens are placed on the card by the card user when the card user initially receives the card. Such timing, however, can allow an illicit recipient to place a fraudulent signature specimen on the card, for fraudulent presentment later. Receiving a signature specimen from a card user prior to issuance of the card, and forming an image of the signature on the card prior to delivery to the card user, precludes an illicit recipient from being able to create a fraudulent signature specimen. \\n     Traditional card manufacturing methods continue to utilize techniques and materials that restrict variations in card style and appearance. One limitation of traditional transaction cards involves the quality of both printed and stored visible information, such as the customer&#39;s signature, name, or the like. Current techniques, for example, where a signature specimen is placed on a card by the card fabricator, utilize digitized image formats (referred to as bitmaps), raster files, or flat image files, such as in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) formats, where the image is formed by a matrix of black or white dots (or colored dots in a color image), with each dot at a specific position within the array being black, white, or a color, dependent on the image. Such arrays allow for image representation at high resolutions, to avoid \u201cblockiness\u201d being visible. However, higher resolutions increase data and processing requirements, and may be beyond the capabilities of image fixing processes, such as matrix printing or forming processes. Furthermore, some forming methods do not utilize a matrixed-image-generation process, but rather a continuous-element process, which utilizes continuous motion of a generating tool, such as an etching laser, where the use of a bitmap or flat image would require conversion to vectored motion instructions for the image generating tool. Thus, these flat image formats do not maximize the ability of a laser machine to etch higher resolution images. When flat image formats are used, laser machines approximate the boundaries of an image, which often leads to etching lower quality images due to problems, such as aliasing problems. This approximation leads to lower quality images with more blur, less smooth motions, more pixelation, less sharpness, less fidelity, etc. Furthermore, lower image quality of a signature specimen can also decrease fraud prevention and security protections due to the signature specimen having a lower comparability to an actual signature. \\n     In addition, as transaction cards increase in prevalence, consumer expectations for transaction card quality have increased. Transaction cards have increasingly been made to meet higher standards regarding materials, durability, security, and appearance. Decreased image quality negatively impacts the ability for transaction card manufacturers to meet these higher standards. \\n     The present disclosure is directed to improvements in transaction cards. Specifically, the present disclosure is directed to increasing the fidelity of visible information on transaction cards by employing a vector format lasering engine. \\n     SUMMARY \\n     In the following description certain aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure will become evident. It should be understood that the disclosure, in its broadest sense, could be practiced without having one or more features of these aspects and embodiments. It should also be understood that these aspects and embodiments are merely exemplary. \\n     The disclosed embodiments generally relate to a process/method and system for the capturing of images and lasering of the captured images on transaction cards using a vector image format. The disclosed embodiments also generally relate to electronically verifying visible information entered into a point-of-service terminal with a scalable vector image file representing the visible information stored for a transaction card. \\n     Certain disclosed embodiments provide systems and computer-implemented methods for the sourcing of visible information using a scalable vector format. For example, the method may include the step of receiving a request to add a first plurality of visible information. The method may also include the step of capturing an image of the first plurality of visible information. The method may further include the step of mapping the image of the first plurality of visible information to a bounding box. The method may also include the step of converting the image into a vector format. Even further, the method may include the step of providing the converted image to a laser machine, wherein providing the converted image causes the laser machine to modify a card to include the converted image. \\n     Certain other disclosed embodiments provide systems and computer-implemented methods for electronically verifying information on a transaction card. For example, the method may include the step of receiving a request to provide a verification status for the transaction card. The method may also include the step of receiving first visible information, the first visible information comprising a signature of a customer written on a point-of-sale terminal. The method may further include the step of receiving second visible information, the second visible information comprising a vector representation of a user signature on a transaction card. The method may also include the step of determining the verification status based on a comparison of the first visible information to the second visible information, which may comprises the steps of running a similarity analysis between the first and second visible information, calculating a score based on the similarity analysis, and comparing the score with a first predetermined threshold. Even further, the method may also include the step of sending the verification status. \\n     In accordance with additional embodiments of the present disclosure, a computer-readable medium is disclosed that stores instructions that, when executed by a processor(s), causes the processor(s) to perform operations consistent with one or more disclosed methods. \\n     It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the disclosed embodiments, as claimed. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate disclosed embodiments and, together with the description, serve to explain the disclosed embodiments.

The physical properties of the transaction card (e.g., size, flexibility, location of various components included in the card) may meet the various international standards, including, for example, ISO/IEC 7810, ISO/IEC 7811, ISO/IEC 7812, ISO/IEC 7813, ISO/IEC 7816, ISO 8583, ISO/IEC 4909, and ISO/IEC 14443. For example, a transaction card may have a dimension of 85.60 mm (width) by 53.98 mm (height) by 0.76 mm (thickness), as specified in ISO/ICE  7810 . \\n       FIGS. 1A-1C  show front-, rear-, and edge-view illustrations, respectively, of an exemplary embodiment of transaction card  100 . The front-view illustration of  FIG. 1A  shows a first side  102  (e.g., a front side) of transaction card  100 , and the rear-view illustration of  FIG. 1B  shows a second side  104  (e.g., a rear side) of transaction card  100  opposite the first side  102 . That is, first side  102  may face a first direction outward from a center of transaction card  100 , and second side  104  may face a second direction outward from the center of transaction card  100  such that the second direction is generally opposite the first direction. For example, transaction card  100  may have a three-dimensional structure with a first dimension D 1  (e.g., a width), a second dimension D 2  (e.g., a length), and a third dimension D 3  (e.g., a thickness), wherein the first side  102  and second side  104  of card  100  are separated by at least one of D 1 , D 2 , and D 3 . As shown in  FIG. 1C , first and second sides  102  and  104  of transaction card  100  are separated by D 3  (e.g., a thickness of card  20 ). It is noted that transaction card  100  is not limited to rectangular shapes and designs, and that dimensions D 1 , D 2 , and D 3  may vary with respect to one another such that transaction card  100  may resemble a different shape. \\n     As shown in  FIG. 1A , first side  102  of transaction card  100  may include visible information  110 .

For example, in some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may receive this request because a customer of a financial service provider would like to order a new transaction card  100  or update an existing transaction card  100 . A customer of a financial service provider may be an actual customer or a perspective customer of the financial service provider. As another example, in other embodiments, visible information modules  392  may receive this request from the customer or financial service provider for other reasons. \\n     In some embodiments, step  402  may comprise receiving a request to add visible information after a customer or a financial service provider has initiated the process to issue a new card or update a preexisting card. In some embodiments, a financial service provider may send the customer a link (e.g., a hyperlink, OR code, telephone number, or the like) for the issuance of a new card or to update a preexisting card. A customer may send the link via the financial service provider as a recommendation to another customer. In other embodiments, an online advertisement for the financial service provider may include the link or the financial service provider may send the link to a customer. In other embodiments, the financial service provider could send the link to a customer in a physical mailing. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may receive a request to add visible information after a customer has filled out forms containing other visible information, such as personal information, transaction information, transaction network information, contact information, a serial number, a hologram, manufacturer information, and/or other information. Additionally, in some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may use intermediary services  208  to determine whether a customer is approved based on the customer credit information, preexisting account information with the financial service provider, internal parameters set by the financial service provider, the risk of fraud, or the like. This approval may be a new transaction card before receiving a request to add visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to order a new transaction card  100  or update an existing transaction card  100 . In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may receive a request to add visible information after a customer has been presented with a prompt to add visible information by visible information modules  392 . \\n     Consistent with disclosed embodiments, at step  404 , visible information modules  392  may capture an image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature). In some embodiments, to capture an image may involve capturing a representation of an image (e.g., a pressure-sensitive imprint.) In some embodiments, capturing an image of visible information includes causing customer terminals  202  to enable an input/output device, such as a camera or the like, to allow the customer to take a picture of the visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may obtain verification from the customer before causing the camera of customer terminals  202  to be enabled. Obtaining verification may involve providing instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to display a prompt that allows a customer to choose between option(s) that indicate whether the customer intends to allow visible information modules  392  to cause customer terminals  202  to enable a camera of customer terminals  202 . In other embodiments, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to enable one or more of its cameras without verification. After a customer activates the one or more cameras and takes a picture, visible information modules  392  may receive an image file representative of the picture. In other embodiments, capturing visible information may include providing instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to display a prompt that allows a customer to upload a preexisting image stored in hardware on customer terminals  202 . \\n     Consistent with disclosed embodiments, at step  406 , visible information modules  392  may allow a customer to map and resize an image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature). In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to display a bounding box. A bounding box, in some embodiments, comprises an enclosed area that designed for contents to fit inside of it. In some embodiments, a bounding box has a border that is visually distinct from the area inside of the border. A bounding box may be any shape, size, or color. The bounding box may be configured to be any size and in any position on transaction card  100 . For example, the bounding box may be displayed on customer terminals  202  over or underneath the first side  102  or the second side  104  of transaction card  100 . As another example, in some embodiments, the size of the bounding box may be dependent on the size of transaction card  100 . As a further example, in some embodiments, the position, size, shape, and other characteristics of the bounding box could vary based on the type, material, size, color, etc., of transaction card  100 . \\n     Additionally, the bounding box may be used as a guide by the customer to resize the received captured image manually. For example, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to display a bounding box and an unaltered captured image. Visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to allow a customer to drag and resize the image so that a customer could cause the image to fit inside of the bounding box. In other embodiments, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to display a bounding box before the image is captured. For example, the bounding box may be transparent except for the border of the bounding box, so that a customer could line-up visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to be within the bounding box before the image is captured by a camera of customer terminals  202 . \\n     In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to indicate that the visible information is inside of the bounding box. For example, visible information modules  392  may provide instructions to cause customer terminals  202  to change the color of the bounding box&#39;s border to red when part of the visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) is outside of the bounding box and green when the visible information is completely inside of the bounding box. In some embodiments, when the visible information is completely inside the bounding box, visible information modules  392  may cause customer terminals  202  to display a notification indicating that the resize was a success and automatically move on to the next steps. \\n     In some embodiments, a customer can cause customer terminals  202  to send a notification to visible information modules  392  that the customer is done with mapping and resizing the image in the bounding box. For example, the customer may send a notification that the customer is done by tapping the screen, selecting a button, speaking, gesturing, or the like. In other embodiments, visible information modules  392  may map and resize the image to fit inside of the bounding box automatically by using mathematical formulas/algorithms, such as interpolation, sampling, or transformations, to fit the image inside of the bounding box. In some of the embodiments, visible information modules  392  may cause customer terminals  202  to display this automatically mapped and resized image in the bounding box. \\n     At step  408 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules  392  may convert the resized image into vector formats, such as SVG, EPS, DWG, or the like. In some embodiments, visible information model  392  may convert the resized image from a flat image format (e.g., PNG) to vector form. For example, visible information model  392  may use an outside process, known as an image tracer, vectorization program, or the like, that takes the resized image saved in a flat image format and converts it to a vector image. In other embodiments, visible information model  392  may convert the resized image saved in a flat image format to a vector image on its own using various mathematical formulas and digital processing techniques. In other embodiments, step  408  may not be needed when customer terminals  202  may have saved the image as a vector format on image capture (e.g., during one of steps  404  and  406 ). \\n     At step  410 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules  392  may save an image of the visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may save a converted image of the visible information to database  210 . Saving the converted image to the database may comprise associating the saved image of visible information with other visible information, such as transaction information, personal information, or the like. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may communicate with intermediary services  208  to associate and save the image of visible information to a database. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may communicate with intermediary services  208  to save the image of visible information on transaction card  100  during the manufacturing process. For example, once a transaction card has been created by laser machine  216 , visible information modules  392  may cause intermediary services  208  to save the image of visible information on data storage component  112  and/or data storage component  122  of transaction card  100 . In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may cause intermediary services  208  to save the image of visible information on server clusters  212  and/or cloud service  214 . In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may save the image of visible information on transaction card  100 , server clusters  212 , and/or cloud service  214 . \\n     At step  412 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules  392  may provide the image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to laser machine  216 . In some embodiments, providing the image of visible information to laser machine  216  may include causing laser machine  216  to laser onto transaction card  100  the image of visible information. In some embodiments, laser machine  216  will create visible information  110  or  120  by laser positioning and intensity commands based on the components of the vector formatted image of visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may receive a response from laser machine  216  indicating that the image of visible information is of an incompatible file type. In response to receiving an error for incompatible file type, in some embodiments, visible information modules  392  may convert and resave the image of visible information into a compatible vector file type. \\n       FIG. 5  is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary transaction system, consistent with disclosed embodiments.

Financial service accounts may include, for example, credit card accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, loan accounts, reward accounts, and other types of financial service accounts. Financial service accounts may be associated with physical transaction cards  100 , such as credit or debit cards that customers use to perform financial service transactions, such as purchasing goods and/or services online or at a terminal (e.g., POS terminal, mobile device, computer, etc.). Financial service accounts may also be associated with electronic financial products and services, such as a digital wallet or similar account that may be used to perform electronic transactions, such as purchasing goods and/or services online. \\n     Financial service provider system  512  may be implemented using different equipment, such as one or more supercomputers, one or more personal computers, one or more servers (e.g., server clusters  212  and/or cloud service  214 ), one or more mainframes, one or more mobile devices, or the like. In some embodiments, financial service provider  512  may comprise hardware, software, and/or firmware modules. In some embodiments, financial service provider  512  may store on its one or more servers system  200  and/or visible information engine  204 . Financial service provider  512  may also be comprised of a plurality of programs stored on memory and one or more processors, or the like. \\n     Merchant system  514  may include one or more computer systems associated with a merchant. For example, merchant system  514  may be associated with an entity that provides goods and/or services (e.g., a retail store). The merchant may include brick-and-mortar location(s) that a customer may physically visit and purchase goods and services using the transaction cards. Such physical locations may include computing devices (e.g., merchant system  514 ) that perform financial service transactions with customers (e.g., POS terminals  516 ). Additionally or alternatively, merchant system  514  may be associated with a merchant who provides an electronic shopping environment, such as a website or other online platform that consumers may access using a computer through a browser, a mobile application, or similar software. Merchant system  514  may include a client device, such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, smartphone, or tablet, which a customer may operate to access the electronic shopping mechanism. Merchant system  514  may be implemented using different equipment, such as one or more supercomputers, one or more personal computers, one or more servers (e.g., server clusters  212  and/or cloud service  214 ), one or more mainframes, one or more mobile devices, or the like. Merchant system  514  may also be comprised of a plurality of programs stored on memory and one or more processors, or the like. \\n     POS terminals  516  may be implemented using different equipment, such as one or more supercomputers, one or more personal computers, one or more servers (e.g., server clusters  212  and/or cloud service  214 ), one or more mainframes, one or more mobile devices, or the like. POS terminals  516  may also be comprised of a plurality of programs stored on memory and one or more processors, or the like. \\n     Network  518  may include any type of network configured to facilitate communications and data exchange between components of transaction system  500 , such as, for example, financial service provider system  512  and merchant system  514 . Network  518  may include, but is not limited to, Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs), such as the Internet. Network  518  may be a single network or a combination of networks. Network  518  is not limited to the above examples and transaction system  500  may implement any type of network that allows entities (shown and not shown) of transaction system  500  to exchange data and information. \\n     Transaction system  500  may be configured to conduct a transaction using transaction card  100 . In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may provide transaction card  100  to a customer for use in conducting transactions associated with a financial service account held by the customer. For example, the customer may use transaction card  100  at a merchant location to make a purchase. During the purchase, information may be transferred from transaction card  100  to merchant system  514  (e.g., POS  516 ). Merchant system  514  may communicate with financial service provider system  512  via network  518  to verify the information and to complete or deny the transaction. For example, merchant system  514  may receive account information from transaction card  100 . Merchant system  514  may transmit the account information and a purchase amount, among other transaction information, to financial service provider system  512 . Financial service provider system  512  may settle the transaction by transferring funds from the customer&#39;s financial service account to a financial service account associated with the merchant. \\n     While transaction system  500  and transaction card  100  are depicted and described in relation to transactions that involve customers, merchants, and financial service providers, it should be understood that these entities are used only as an example to illustrate one environment in which transaction card  100  may be used. Transaction card  100  is not limited to financial products and may be any physical card product that is configured to store and/or transmit information. For example, transaction card  100  may be an identification card configured to provide information to a device in order to identify the holder of the card (e.g., a driver&#39;s license). \\n       FIG. 6  is a flowchart of an exemplary process for electronically verifying visible information (e.g., a customer signature) entered into a POS terminal with a scalable vector formatted file representing visible information stored for a transaction card, consistent with disclosed embodiments. In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  has one or more processors configured to store instructions consistent with the disclosed embodiments of visible information engine  204  and/or system  200 . In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may utilize visible information engine  204  and/or system  200  to process visible information. \\n     At step  602 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may process a transaction for a customer using transaction card  100 . A customer may attempt to pay for an item at merchant system  514  by inserting transaction card  100  into POS terminals  516 . For example, a client may insert data storage component  112  (i.e., an EMV chip) into POS terminals  516 . As another example, a client may swipe data storage component  122  (e.g., magnetic stripe) through a magnetic stripe reader on POS terminal  516 . In some embodiments, the stored contents of either data storage component  112  and/or data storage components  122  will be read by the POS terminal  516 . In some embodiments, the stored contents of either component  112  and/or data storage components  122  will include a vector image file of visible information (e.g., a customer signature) and other visible information, such as one or more of personal information, transaction information, contact information, or the like. \\n     At step  604 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, POS terminal  516  may request a customer to input visible information. In other embodiments, POS terminal  516  may require a customer to input visible information. In some embodiments, a customer may input visible information by writing it. In some embodiments, visible information engine  204  of financial service provider  512  may provide instructions to cause POS terminal  516  to request or require a customer to input visible information. In other embodiments, a customer may input visible information by typing it. \\n     POS terminal  516  may provide a display containing a bounding box for visible information to be digitally written on the screen of POS terminal  516 . In some embodiments, visible information engine  204  of financial service provider  512  may provide instructions to cause POS terminal  516  to provide a display containing a bounding box for visible information to be digitally written on the screen of POS terminal  516 . \\n     Consistent with disclosed embodiments, at step  606 , POS terminal  516  may receive input visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature). In some embodiments, POS terminal  516  may confirm that the customer acknowledges that the input visible information is accurate before accepting the input visible information. In some embodiments, visible information engine  204  of financial service provider  512  may provide instructions to cause POS terminal  516  to confirm that the customer acknowledges that the input visible information is accurate before accepting the input visible information. This confirmation can be done, for example, by requesting and receiving a notification from the customer acknowledging that the input visible information is accurate before accepting the input visible information. \\n     At step  608 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, POS terminal  516  may send data representing the input visible information and a stored image of visible information read from data storage component  112  and/or data storage components  122  to visible information engine  204  of financial service provider system  512  to determine the customer&#39;s inputted visible information is valid. In some embodiments, visible information engine  204  of financial service provider  512  may cause POS  516  to send this data. In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  will compare the data representing the input visible information with the stored image of visible information read from data storage component  112  and/or data storage components  122 . In other embodiments, financial service provider system  512  will compare the data representing the input visible information with a vector formatted image of visible information on its servers, saved consistently with step  410 . In some other embodiments, financial service provider system  512  will compare the stored vector formatted visible information read from data storage component  112  and/or data storage components  122  with a saved vector formatted image of visible information on its servers consistent with step  410 . To compare, for example, financial service provider system  512  may run a similarity analysis using various mathematical principles of vector formatting comparisons along with the vector formatting file contents to determine a similarity score regarding the comparison. Financial service provider system  512  may then compare the similarity score with a predetermined threshold to determine if the visible information is valid. \\n     Consistent with disclosed embodiments, if the input visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) is determined to be not valid, in some embodiments financial service provider system  512  may cause POS terminal  516  to report that the payment is being rejected. Financial service provider system  512  may instruct POS service to repeat steps  604  to  608  in order to test if the determined visible information is valid a plurality of times. Financial service provider system  512  may have a threshold value of how many times the test can be completed before the transaction is stopped. In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may put a temporary hold on transaction card  100 , preventing the customer from completing any transactions with transaction card  100  until the issue is resolved. Further, in some embodiments, financial service provider  512  may require additional authentication to accept the transaction, such as a secret code. In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may report that a potential fraud has occurred and suspend transaction card  100 . In some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may notify authorities that a fraud has occurred. \\n     At step  612 , consistent with disclosed embodiments, if the input visible information is determined to be valid, in some embodiments, financial service provider system  512  may cause POS terminal  516  to report that the payment is being accepted. Financial service provider system  512  may then take funds from the transaction from the financial account associated with transaction card  100  and deliver them to the financial account of merchant system  514 . \\n     Descriptions of the disclosed embodiments are not exhaustive and are not limited to the precise forms or embodiments disclosed.

The disclosed embodiments also generally relate to electronically verifying visible information entered into a point-of-service terminal with a scalable vector image file representing the visible information stored for a transaction card.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">Background</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Transaction cards, such as credit and debit cards, have become a primary means for individuals to complete transactions involving data exchange. Traditional transaction cards are constructed in a sheeted laminate press. The shape of the card is die cut, and then, the card is personalized. Typically, transaction cards are cut from laminated sheets of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC), or other similar materials. After the overall shape of the card is formed, the card may be modified to add functional and/or visible features. For example, a magnetic stripe and/or microchip may be affixed to one side, the card may be stamped with the card number and customer name, and color(s) or a design may be added for appearance.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">As a fraud prevention measure, such cards may be provided with a signature specimen, such that a vendor relying on the card for some aspect of a transaction, can authenticate that the person presenting the card is the actual authorized user of the card based on a comparison of a fresh signature provided at presentation with a signature specimen available on the card. Traditional signature specimens are placed on the card by the card user when the card user initially receives the card. Such timing, however, can allow an illicit recipient to place a fraudulent signature specimen on the card, for fraudulent presentment later. Receiving a signature specimen from a card user prior to issuance of the card, and forming an image of the signature on the card prior to delivery to the card user, precludes an illicit recipient from being able to create a fraudulent signature specimen.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Traditional card manufacturing methods continue to utilize techniques and materials that restrict variations in card style and appearance. One limitation of traditional transaction cards involves the quality of both printed and stored visible information, such as the customer&#39;s signature, name, or the like. Current techniques, for example, where a signature specimen is placed on a card by the card fabricator, utilize digitized image formats (referred to as bitmaps), raster files, or flat image files, such as in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) formats, where the image is formed by a matrix of black or white dots (or colored dots in a color image), with each dot at a specific position within the array being black, white, or a color, dependent on the image. Such arrays allow for image representation at high resolutions, to avoid \u201cblockiness\u201d being visible. However, higher resolutions increase data and processing requirements, and may be beyond the capabilities of image fixing processes, such as matrix printing or forming processes. Furthermore, some forming methods do not utilize a matrixed-image-generation process, but rather a continuous-element process, which utilizes continuous motion of a generating tool, such as an etching laser, where the use of a bitmap or flat image would require conversion to vectored motion instructions for the image generating tool. Thus, these flat image formats do not maximize the ability of a laser machine to etch higher resolution images. When flat image formats are used, laser machines approximate the boundaries of an image, which often leads to etching lower quality images due to problems, such as aliasing problems. This approximation leads to lower quality images with more blur, less smooth motions, more pixelation, less sharpness, less fidelity, etc. Furthermore, lower image quality of a signature specimen can also decrease fraud prevention and security protections due to the signature specimen having a lower comparability to an actual signature.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">In addition, as transaction cards increase in prevalence, consumer expectations for transaction card quality have increased. Transaction cards have increasingly been made to meet higher standards regarding materials, durability, security, and appearance. Decreased image quality negatively impacts the ability for transaction card manufacturers to meet these higher standards.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">The present disclosure is directed to improvements in transaction cards. Specifically, the present disclosure is directed to increasing the fidelity of visible information on transaction cards by employing a vector format lasering engine.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">SUMMARY</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">In the following description certain aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure will become evident.

In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may receive a request to add visible information after a customer has filled out forms containing other visible information, such as personal information, transaction information, transaction network information, contact information, a serial number, a hologram, manufacturer information, and/or other information. Additionally, in some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may use intermediary services <b>208</b> to determine whether a customer is approved based on the customer credit information, preexisting account information with the financial service provider, internal parameters set by the financial service provider, the risk of fraud, or the like. This approval may be a new transaction card before receiving a request to add visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to order a new transaction card <b>100</b> or update an existing transaction card <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may receive a request to add visible information after a customer has been presented with a prompt to add visible information by visible information modules <b>392</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, at step <b>404</b>, visible information modules <b>392</b> may capture an image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature). In some embodiments, to capture an image may involve capturing a representation of an image (e.g., a pressure-sensitive imprint.) In some embodiments, capturing an image of visible information includes causing customer terminals <b>202</b> to enable an input/output device, such as a camera or the like, to allow the customer to take a picture of the visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may obtain verification from the customer before causing the camera of customer terminals <b>202</b> to be enabled. Obtaining verification may involve providing instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a prompt that allows a customer to choose between option(s) that indicate whether the customer intends to allow visible information modules <b>392</b> to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to enable a camera of customer terminals <b>202</b>. In other embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to enable one or more of its cameras without verification. After a customer activates the one or more cameras and takes a picture, visible information modules <b>392</b> may receive an image file representative of the picture. In other embodiments, capturing visible information may include providing instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a prompt that allows a customer to upload a preexisting image stored in hardware on customer terminals <b>202</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">Consistent with disclosed embodiments, at step <b>406</b>, visible information modules <b>392</b> may allow a customer to map and resize an image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature). In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a bounding box. A bounding box, in some embodiments, comprises an enclosed area that designed for contents to fit inside of it. In some embodiments, a bounding box has a border that is visually distinct from the area inside of the border. A bounding box may be any shape, size, or color. The bounding box may be configured to be any size and in any position on transaction card <b>100</b>. For example, the bounding box may be displayed on customer terminals <b>202</b> over or underneath the first side <b>102</b> or the second side <b>104</b> of transaction card <b>100</b>. As another example, in some embodiments, the size of the bounding box may be dependent on the size of transaction card <b>100</b>. As a further example, in some embodiments, the position, size, shape, and other characteristics of the bounding box could vary based on the type, material, size, color, etc., of transaction card <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">Additionally, the bounding box may be used as a guide by the customer to resize the received captured image manually. For example, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a bounding box and an unaltered captured image. Visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to allow a customer to drag and resize the image so that a customer could cause the image to fit inside of the bounding box. In other embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a bounding box before the image is captured. For example, the bounding box may be transparent except for the border of the bounding box, so that a customer could line-up visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to be within the bounding box before the image is captured by a camera of customer terminals <b>202</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to indicate that the visible information is inside of the bounding box. For example, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide instructions to cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to change the color of the bounding box&#39;s border to red when part of the visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) is outside of the bounding box and green when the visible information is completely inside of the bounding box. In some embodiments, when the visible information is completely inside the bounding box, visible information modules <b>392</b> may cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display a notification indicating that the resize was a success and automatically move on to the next steps.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">In some embodiments, a customer can cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to send a notification to visible information modules <b>392</b> that the customer is done with mapping and resizing the image in the bounding box. For example, the customer may send a notification that the customer is done by tapping the screen, selecting a button, speaking, gesturing, or the like. In other embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may map and resize the image to fit inside of the bounding box automatically by using mathematical formulas/algorithms, such as interpolation, sampling, or transformations, to fit the image inside of the bounding box. In some of the embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may cause customer terminals <b>202</b> to display this automatically mapped and resized image in the bounding box.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">At step <b>408</b>, consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may convert the resized image into vector formats, such as SVG, EPS, DWG, or the like. In some embodiments, visible information model <b>392</b> may convert the resized image from a flat image format (e.g., PNG) to vector form. For example, visible information model <b>392</b> may use an outside process, known as an image tracer, vectorization program, or the like, that takes the resized image saved in a flat image format and converts it to a vector image. In other embodiments, visible information model <b>392</b> may convert the resized image saved in a flat image format to a vector image on its own using various mathematical formulas and digital processing techniques. In other embodiments, step <b>408</b> may not be needed when customer terminals <b>202</b> may have saved the image as a vector format on image capture (e.g., during one of steps <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">At step <b>410</b>, consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may save an image of the visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may save a converted image of the visible information to database <b>210</b>. Saving the converted image to the database may comprise associating the saved image of visible information with other visible information, such as transaction information, personal information, or the like. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may communicate with intermediary services <b>208</b> to associate and save the image of visible information to a database. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may communicate with intermediary services <b>208</b> to save the image of visible information on transaction card <b>100</b> during the manufacturing process. For example, once a transaction card has been created by laser machine <b>216</b>, visible information modules <b>392</b> may cause intermediary services <b>208</b> to save the image of visible information on data storage component <b>112</b> and/or data storage component <b>122</b> of transaction card <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may cause intermediary services <b>208</b> to save the image of visible information on server clusters <b>212</b> and/or cloud service <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may save the image of visible information on transaction card <b>100</b>, server clusters <b>212</b>, and/or cloud service <b>214</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">At step <b>412</b>, consistent with disclosed embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may provide the image of visible information (e.g., a customer&#39;s signature) to laser machine <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, providing the image of visible information to laser machine <b>216</b> may include causing laser machine <b>216</b> to laser onto transaction card <b>100</b> the image of visible information. In some embodiments, laser machine <b>216</b> will create visible information <b>110</b> or <b>120</b> by laser positioning and intensity commands based on the components of the vector formatted image of visible information. In some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may receive a response from laser machine <b>216</b> indicating that the image of visible information is of an incompatible file type. In response to receiving an error for incompatible file type, in some embodiments, visible information modules <b>392</b> may convert and resave the image of visible information into a compatible vector file type.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary transaction system, consistent with disclosed embodiments.

The collision judgment line adjustment module  104  generates timing data  122  based on the default value and the adjustment to the timing steering. \\n     As can be appreciated, other timing can be adjusted in various embodiments as the disclosure is not limited to the present examples. \\n     With reference back to  FIG.  2   , the waypoint adjustment module  106  receives as input the surface change data  116 , and waypoint data  124  defining points of the upcoming path. The waypoint adjustment module  106  reformulates the waypoints of the path to include future surface values. For example, the current surface mu at time t is determined as \u03bc(t); and the current curvature value at time t is defined as h(t). The waypoint adjustment module  106  projects future friction values: \u03bc(t+n\u03c4). The waypoint adjustment module  106  then associates the future friction values with the curvature values of the waypoints on time. The waypoint adjustment module  106  provides reformulated waypoint data  126  including waypoints defined by the curvature and the surface value. \\n     In various embodiments, the control adjustment module  108  receives as input the reformulated waypoint data  126 , braking command data  128 , and/or steering command data  130 . When lateral control is active in the vehicle  10 , the control adjustment module  108  adjusts the steering command and/or the braking command based on the reformulated waypoint data  126 . For example, the control adjustment module  108  uses model predictive control to adjust the steering command and/or the braking command. In one example, a non-linear bicycle model can be modified to take into account the surface values: \\n         M{dot over (V)}y=\u2212MrV   x   +F   yf (\u03b1 f ,\u03bc( t ))cos(\u03b4)+ F   yr (\u03b1 r ,\u03bc( t ))\u2212 Mg  cos (\u03b8)sin(\u03c6)\\n \\n         I   Z   {dot over (r)}=aF   yf (\u03b1 f ,\u03bc)\u2212 bF   yr (\u03b1 r ,\u03bc( t ))\\n \\n         {dot over (d)}=V   y +( V   x   +dr )tan \u0394\u03c8\\n \\n     The control adjustment module  108  then computes error tracking data  134 . For example, a lateral heading and offset error can be computed based on: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \u0394 \\n               \\u2062 \\n               \\n                 \u03c8 \\n                 \u02d9 \\n               \\n             \\n             = \\n             \\n               r \\n               - \\n               \\n                 \u03c7 \\n                 \\u2062 \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         V \\n                         x \\n                       \\n                       + \\n                       dr \\n                     \\n                     \\n                       cos \\n                       \\u2062 \\n                       \u0394 \\n                       \\u2062 \\n                       \u03c8 \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   . \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     In various embodiments, the path adjustment module  110  receives as input the reformulated waypoint data  126 , and the error tracking data  134 . The path adjustment module  110  adjusts the upcoming path by redistributing the path curvature to satisfy the friction limitations. For example, the path curvature (x) is adjusted between each waypoint to a value less than a maximum allowable path curvature for the surface mu at x. The path adjustment module  110  generates adjusted path data  136  based on the adjusted values. \\n     The lateral and longitudinal control module  112  receives as input the adjusted command data  132 , and the adjusted path data  136 . The lateral and longitudinal control module  112  generates control signals  138  to the actuators of the vehicle  10  to control the steering and/or braking of the vehicle  10  such that the vehicle follows the road wheel angle, the braking, and/or the adjusted path indicated by the received data. \\n     Referring now to  FIG.  4   , and with continued reference to  FIGS.  1 - 3   , flowcharts illustrate control methods  400  that can be performed by the system  100  of  FIGS.  1 - 3    in accordance with the present disclosure. As can be appreciated in light of the disclosure, the order of operation within the methods is not limited to the sequential execution as illustrated in  FIG.  4    but may be performed in one or more varying orders as applicable and in accordance with the present disclosure. In various embodiments, the method  400  can be scheduled to run based on one or more predetermined events, and/or can run continuously during operation of the autonomous vehicle  10 . \\n     In one example, the method  400  may begin at  405 . The current road wheel angle, vehicle state, and desired path (waypoints to follow) are received at  410 . Thereafter, surface value data is received at  420  and it is determined whether it is predicted that a change to low friction is expected in the upcoming path at  430 . When low friction is not expected in the upcoming path at  430 , the method  400  continues with receiving the control data at  410 . When low friction is expected in the upcoming path at  430 , it is determined whether automated lateral control is active at  440 . When automated lateral control is not active at  440 , the method  400  continues with generating a warning message to the driver indicating that a low friction area lies ahead at  450 . Thereafter, the method may end at  460 . \\n     When automated lateral control is active at  440 , the friction values are projected to each waypoint ahead at  470 , for example, as discussed above. Model predictive control is used to determine an optimal road wheel angle and braking command at  480 , for example, as discussed above. \\n     Thereafter, a predicted tracking error is computed at  490  and compared to a threshold at  500 . When the predicted tracking error is not greater than a threshold at  500 , the lateral and longitudinal motion controller communicates control input commands to the actuator system of the vehicle to control the vehicle based on the updated waypoints at  510 . Thereafter, the method may end at  460 . \\n     When the predicted tracking error is greater than a threshold at  500 , the path planner re-distributes the path curvature to satisfy the friction limitation at  520  and communicates the new path to lateral and longitudinal motion controller at  530 . Thereafter, the lateral and longitudinal motion controller communicates control input commands to the actuator system of the vehicle to control the vehicle based on the updated waypoints at  510 . Thereafter, the method may end at  460 . \\n     While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the disclosure in any way.

As can be appreciated in light of the disclosure, the order of operation within the methods is not limited to the sequential execution as illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>4</b> </figref> but may be performed in one or more varying orders as applicable and in accordance with the present disclosure. In various embodiments, the method <b>400</b> can be scheduled to run based on one or more predetermined events, and/or can run continuously during operation of the autonomous vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0058\">In one example, the method <b>400</b> may begin at <b>405</b>. The current road wheel angle, vehicle state, and desired path (waypoints to follow) are received at <b>410</b>. Thereafter, surface value data is received at <b>420</b> and it is determined whether it is predicted that a change to low friction is expected in the upcoming path at <b>430</b>.

When automated lateral control is not active at <b>440</b>, the method <b>400</b> continues with generating a warning message to the driver indicating that a low friction area lies ahead at <b>450</b>.

When the predicted tracking error is not greater than a threshold at <b>500</b>, the lateral and longitudinal motion controller communicates control input commands to the actuator system of the vehicle to control the vehicle based on the updated waypoints at <b>510</b>. Thereafter, the method may end at <b>460</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0061\">When the predicted tracking error is greater than a threshold at <b>500</b>, the path planner re-distributes the path curvature to satisfy the friction limitation at <b>520</b> and communicates the new path to lateral and longitudinal motion controller at <b>530</b>. Thereafter, the lateral and longitudinal motion controller communicates control input commands to the actuator system of the vehicle to control the vehicle based on the updated waypoints at <b>510</b>.
