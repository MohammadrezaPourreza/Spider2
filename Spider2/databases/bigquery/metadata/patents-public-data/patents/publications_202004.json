Ill-120.5)  \\n parts which will be referred to more or less in detail in the following description.  \\n  The chaser carrier or housing is preferably made of die cast material, or is a die casting. The preferred construction of this part of the assembly isbest shown in Fig. &#39;7. The central portion of the housing is formed with a threaded barrel 5 on which the work-holder C is adapted to be threaded. The chasers or cutters are indicated at 6, note particularly Figs. 5 and 6, the outer end or side of the carrierhousing beingformed with a plurality of radial slots 1 in which the chasers are mounted for limited radial movement. The metal around these slots is built up as at 8, to thereby reinforce the slots and the latter are provided when the plate is cast instead of beingmachined, as in prior known tools of this type.  \\n Chaser slots formed by machining are of neces sity open at one side to provide for entrance of a milling cutter. In contradistinction, the slots of l the present improved tool are closed on both sides and strongly reinforced. at the side which has to take the greatest thrust during the threading operation. The cut out portions indicated at.  \\n 9 and II] are simply to lighten the casting withed detent member or latch ball ll, note particularly Fig. 6, which is inserted in a hole i la formed in the housing or carrier Aand urged into a seat lib formed in each of the chasers 6 by a spring I2, the latter being partly housed in the backing plate E. The hole No is tapered or constricted toward its lower end, so that the latch ball I I may be inserted in the upper end of the hole and will lodge near the bottom, but will project sufficiently to engage in seat lib. This arrangement facilitates assemblage of the respective parts, and the ball is fully housed and protected and out of the way.  \\n  The present tool is of that type wherein the cutters are permitted a certain amount of retraction or backing-oil movement during the threading operation in order to provide a certain amount of taper to the threaded pipe end. Cam posts l2 are provided and. at their lower extremities project through registering holes 12a formed in the backing plate E and chaser-carrier A and terminating in rear of the cutter slots 1. Each of the posts I2 are formed with a tapered cam or drift surface i217 against which the rear end of each chaser B abuts, so that as the pipe is threaded and the housing A and coacting parts advance into the work-holder, the chasers will integrally with the said carrier.  \\n back off slightly, as is well understood by those having a knowledge of this type of thread cutting tool.  \\n Another feature of the present invention is 5 the method of anchoring or mounting the cam posts I2, which is accomplished by the post plate D. This post plate is detachably associated with the work-holder C, instead of being made an integral part therewith or with some other part of 10 the assembly, and as a consequence it may be 15 are anchored by an integral part of the assembly.  \\n The plate D is formed with radial corner slots I3 in which the upper extremity of each of the posts I2 is fitted, the posts being formed with a necked portion I2c for this purpose. The plate D is fitted onto the inner extremity of the workholder 0 in a manner such as to provide an angular floating or rotatable mounting, so that the posts have both radial and angular floating action. To provide a mounting which will bring about the foregoing advantages, the workholder is formed with an annular groove Ma, and in this groove a snap ring I4 engages, thereby detachably holding the work-holder in position, note particularly Figs. 3 and 4.  \\n  The drive or ratchet ring B is provided with handle sockets I 5 and is provided with a plurality of internal teeth I6. The ratchet mechanism consists of a pair of oppositely disposed pawls or dogs I1 and Ila, which have their inner extremities disposed against an abutment I3 (note Fig. 8) which is preferably formed integrally with the chaser carrier A. At the lower or outer eX- tremity of the abutment I8, a pawl retaining boss or member I9 is provided and is also formed Springs 29 and 20a normally urge the pawls I l and Ila outwardly into engagement with the teeth of the drive ring B. A pawl cam 2I, shown more or less in detail in Fig. 9, is provided and is formed with 5 a cam portion or toe 2Ia which rides on the boss I9 and at its opposite side edges is formed with cam surfaces 2Ib adapted to engage the pawls I1 and Ila and move the latter clear of the teeth I6 when the cam member 2| is moved in an arcuate path by means of the lever 22, note Fig. 10.  \\n Lever 22 is provided with an eccentrically disposed pin 22a adapted to engage in a slot 23 formed in the cam member 2|, note Fig. &#39;7. The cam member 2| is formed with a plurality of detent notches or recesses 24 adapted to engage a detent or spring-pressed ball 24a disposed in the abutment I 8. The lever 22 is secured on a pin 22b which is journaled in the backing plate E and is provided with a cam disc 220 which in turn carries pin 22a. To hold the thumb lever under tension, a bent spring washer 25 is arranged to bear against the disc 221).  \\n  In operation, assuming it is desired to rotate the cutter or die stock in a thread-cutting di- 5 rection, the thumb lever 22 may be turned to the right in Fig. 1, thereby sliding the cam member 2| against the pawl I1 and moving it clear of the ratchet teeth I6 while the pawl Ila remains in driving engagement with said teeth.  \\n  To run the cutter or die stock in a reverse direction or to back it off of the cut threads, the lever may be turned in the opposite direction, thereby reversing the position of the pawls, note the position of the parts in Fig. 8. Assuming it is desired to use the die as a solid die for work over a certain size, then the cam member 2I may be adjusted to intermediate position at which point both the dogs I1 and Ila engage the ratchet teeth I6 and lock the drive ring with the chaser housing. Two handle sockets I5 are preferably provided so that two men may work the same tool, or one man may use both hands to the best advantage.  \\n  It will be noted that the pawls Il, Ila are so constructed and arranged that they will transmit the driving thrust in a substantially straight line to the abutment I8, said pawls projecting at a tangent and having their faces lying in substantially the same plane as the teeth of the drive ring. This construction will stand relatively great thrust.  \\n  It will be understood that certain variations in structure and design may be adopted within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.  \\n I claim:  \\n  1. In a thread cutting tool, a chaser-carrier plate formed with a series of radial chaser slots, chasers mounted for radial movement in said slots, a work-holder operatively connected to floating action in said plate and said plate havl ing an annular floating connection with said Work-holder.  \\n  2. In a thread cutting tool, a chaser-carrier plate having a threaded barrel and a series of radial chaser slots, chasers mounted in said slots, a work-holder threaded on said barrel, a cam post plate rotatably connected to the inner end of said work-holder, said plate being formed with a plurality of radially open slots, and cam posts projecting into said chaser slots in rear of said chasers and having their ends anchored in said radial open slots of the said cam post plate.  \\n  3. In a thread cutting tool, a chaser-carrier plate having a threaded work-holder barrel and a series of radial chaser slots, chasers mounted for radial movement in said slots, a work-holder threaded on said barrel and having an annular peripheral groove at its inner extremity, a cam post plate rotatably disposed in said groove, a snap ring for detachably connecting said plate to said barrel, and a series of cam posts projecting into said chaser slots in rear of said chasers, said cam post plate being formed with a series of radially open slots to receive and fioatingly anchor the ends of said cam posts.  \\n  4. In a thread cutting tool, a chaser-carrier plate formed of cast metal and having a series of radial chaser slots formed therein, said plate having abutments built up around the chaser slot and extending beyond the confines of the slot adjacent the trailing edge of the chasers for furnishing the chasers with lateral support during a thread cutting operation.  \\n WILLIAM O.
