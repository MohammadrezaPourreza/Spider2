Aerial vehicle  100  may be selectively operable in a multicopter configuration and/or a fixed wing configuration. In the multicopter configuration, lift may be provided predominantly by propelling air mass downwardly from the aerial vehicle  100 . In the fixed wing configuration, lift may be provided predominantly by rearward air movement across or onto the wing(s) of the aerial vehicle  100 . The multicopter configuration (also referred to herein as a vertical thrust configuration) may conveniently permit vertical takeoffs and landings. The fixed wing configuration (also referred to herein as a horizontal thrust configuration) may provide enhanced flight efficiency for greater range between takeoff and landing. \\n     In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle  100  includes a body  102  configured as a flying wing  104 . That is, aerial vehicle  100  is absent a distinct fuselage or tail. As shown in  FIG. 3 , the cross-section of wing  104  may be shaped as an aerofoil for developing lift in the fixed wing configuration as described in more detail below. As used herein and in the claims, an aerofoil is any cross-sectional shape suitable for a wing to develop lift in response to forward relative movement of the wing through air. In other embodiments, wing  104  may be a flat wing that provides lift by its angle of attack. \\n     Returning to  FIG. 1 , wing  104  may have any top view shape. In the illustrated example, wing  104  is substantially triangularly shaped. In other embodiments, the top view shape of wing  104  may be similar to another regular shape (e.g. circular, square, or other polygonal shape), or an irregular shape.  FIG. 15  shows an embodiment  500  including a rectangular shaped wing  104 .  FIG. 20  shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle  100  including a diamond shaped wing  104 . \\n     With continuing reference to  FIG. 1 , aerial vehicle  100  may include a multicopter  108  mounted in a multicopter opening (i.e. aperture)  112  in wing  104 . Multicopter  108  may be substantially centered along a longitudinal wing axis  116 , and/or substantially centered along a lateral wing axis  120 . Wing axes  116  and  120  each extend through the center of mass of aerial vehicle  100 . In the illustrated example, multicopter  108  and multicopter opening  112  are substantially centered along both wing axes  116  and  120 . This may improve the mass balance/symmetry of aerial vehicle  100 , and may enhance the balance/symmetry of thrust developed by multicopter  108 . In alternative embodiments, multicopter  108  may be positioned off-centered from both wing axes  116  and  120 .  FIG. 15  shows an embodiment  500  including a multicopter  108  mounted outside of wing  104 . \\n     Multicopter opening  112  may have any shape. In the illustrated example, multicopter opening  112  is circular. In alternative embodiments, multicopter opening may have another regular shape (e.g. triangular, rectangular, hexagonal, etc.), or an irregular shape.  FIG. 24  shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle  100  including a multicopter opening  112  that is rectangular. \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 1 , multicopter  108  may be mounted to wing  104  with free rotation about a multicopter axis  124 . This may permit free relative rotation of multicopter  108  relative to wing  104  at least within a non-zero angular range of motion. The non-zero angular range of motion may be between 10-360 degrees, such as 10-180 degrees, 10-90 degrees, 10-60 degrees, at least 30 degrees, or 30-90 degrees for example. For example, multicopter  108  may be rotatable about multicopter axis  124  relative to wing  104  substantially without any transmission of torque between multicopter  108  and wing  104  (except perhaps insignificant friction at the rotational joint). In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  100  may be free of devices which transmit torque to rotate multicopter  108  about multicopter axis  124  relative to wing  104 . \\n     Multicopter axis  124  may extend in any direction relative to wing  104 . In some embodiments, multicopter axis  124  may extend parallel to one of wing axes  116  and  120 , or multicopter axis  124  may be coplanar with wing axes  116  and  120 . For example, multicopter axis  124  may extend parallel to, or be collinear with, lateral wing axis  120  as shown. As exemplified in  FIG. 4 , this may permit multicopter  108  to rotate about multicopter axis  124  to change the direction  128  of thrust provided by multicopter  108  to aerial vehicle  100 .  FIG. 21  shows another embodiment where multicopter axis  124  is parallel and spaced apart from lateral wing axis  120 . In the illustrated example, multicopter axis  124  is positioned below lateral wing axis  120 . \\n     Referring again to  FIG. 1 , multicopter  108  may include a plurality of rotors  132 . Multicopter  108  including rotors  132  may be rotatable, relative to wing  104 , as a unitary assembly about multicopter axis  124 . As shown in  FIG. 4 , rotation of multicopter  108  about multicopter axis  124  may include rotation of each rotor  132  about multicopter axis  124 . In some embodiments, multicopter rotors  132  may be fixedly positioned and oriented relative to each other. For example, multicopter  108  may be free of actuators for controlling the position or orientation of multicopter rotors  132  relative to each other. Multicopter rotors  132  may be rigidly connected together in any manner. For example, multicopter rotors  132  may be rigidly connected by a frame  144 . \\n     Multicopter  108  may be freely rotatably mounted to body  102  in any manner. In the illustrated embodiment, multicopter frame  144  is mounted to an axle  148 , which itself is mounted to wing  104 . As shown, multicopter frame  144  may be rigidly mounted to axle  148  and axle  148  may be rotatably mounted to wing  104 . In this example, axle  148  may be collinear with multicopter axis  124 . Axle  148  is shown mounted to wing  104  at opposite ends of multicopter opening  112 . Optionally, axle  148  may be mounted to wing  104  by axle bearings  152 . Alternatively or in addition, axle  148  may be loosely held in axle openings  156  formed in wing  104  and wing  104  may be free of bearings  152 . In alternative embodiments, multicopter frame  144  may be rotatably mounted to axle  148 , and axle  148  may be rigidly connected to wing  104 . In a further alternative, multicopter frame  144  may be rotatably mounted to axle  148 , and axle  148  may be rotatably mounted to wing  104 . \\n     Multicopter  108  may include any number of rotors  132 . For example, multicopter  108  may include 2 or more rotors  132 , or at least  4  rotors  132 . In the illustrated embodiments, multicopter  108  includes four rotors  132 , and is commonly referred to as a quadcopter.  FIG. 24  shows another example including a multicopter  108  with two rotors  132 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 1 , each multicopter rotor  132  may include any number of rotor blades  136 . Further, each multicopter rotor  132  may include the same number of blades  136  as each other multicopter rotor  132 , or one or more (or all) multicopter rotors  132  may include a different number of rotor blades  136  than one or more other multicopter rotors  132 . In some examples, each multicopter rotor  132  may include 1 or more rotor blades  136 . In the illustrated embodiment, each rotor  132  includes 2 rotor blades  136 .  FIG. 24  shows an example of a multicopter  108  where each rotor  132  includes 3 rotor blades  136 . Each multicopter rotor  132  may include rotor blades  136  of the same size, or one or more (or all) multicopter rotors  132  may include rotor blades  136  of different sizes than the other multicopter rotors  132 . In the illustrated embodiment, all multicopter rotor blades  136  are the same size. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 3 , each multicopter rotor  132  is operable to rotate rotor blades  136  about a respective rotor axis  140 . Typically, the direction  160  of thrust for a multicopter rotor  132  is parallel to its rotor axis  140 . Rotor axes  140  of multicopter  108  may all be parallel as shown. Alternatively, one or more (or all) rotor axes  140  may extend at an angle to other rotor axes  140 . In this case, multicopter thrust direction  128  may be the average of multicopter rotor thrust directions  160  weighted by thrust magnitude. \\n     Referring back to  FIG. 1 , multicopter rotors  132  may be arranged in any positional arrangement. For example, multicopter rotors  132  may be evenly or unevenly distributed in a regular arrangement (e.g. a circular arrangement, a regular polygon arrangement, or a grid arrangement) or an irregular arrangement, which may be centered on multicopter axis  124  or center-offset from multicopter axis  124 . In the illustrated example, multicopter rotors  132  are evenly distributed in a circular arrangement centered on multicopter axis  124 .  FIG. 24  shows another example of multicopter  108  including multicopter rotors  132  aligned with wing longitudinal axis  116 . As shown, one multicopter rotor  132  is forwardly of the multicopter axis  124 , and one multicopter rotor  132  is rearward of the multicopter axis  124 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 3 , each multicopter rotor  132  is operable to rotate its respective rotor blades  136  about its respective rotor axis  140 . For example, each multicopter rotor  132  may include a rotor motor  164  connected to the rotor blades  136  of that multicopter rotor  132 , as shown. In some embodiments, the rotary direction of a rotor motor  164  may be selectively reversible for reversing the thrust direction of the multicopter rotor  132 . \\n     Referring to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , aerial vehicle  100  may include a hardware controller  168 . As shown, hardware controller  168  may include a wireless receiver  172  for receiving wireless control signals (e.g. from user operable handheld controller), and a processor  176  for interpreting the control signals from wireless receiver  172 . Processor  176  may be connected (e.g. by one or more I/O ports  178 ) to the motors (e.g. rotor motors  164 ), and other actuators of aerial vehicle  100  to operate the aerial vehicle as described herein. For example, processor  176  may be electrically connected to each multicopter rotor motor  164  to separately control the torque of each rotor motor  164 . Hardware controller  168  may also include one or more sensors  180  in communication with processor  176  by wire or wirelessly. For example, a sensor  180  may be a multi-axis gyroscopic sensor for determining the angular orientation of wing  104  and multicopter  108 , a GPS sensor for determining the location coordinates of aerial vehicle  100 , a barometer, a sonar sensor, or an infrared sensor for determining the altitude of aerial vehicle  100  above a surface below. In some embodiments, one or more of sensors  180  may be positioned on wing  104 , and one or more of sensors  180  may be positioned on multicopter  108 . For example, separate accelerometers may be mounted to each of wing  104  and multicopter  108  for sensing the orientations of both the wing  104  and multicopter  108 . \\n     Hardware controller  168  may be mounted to any component of aerial vehicle  100 . In the illustrated embodiment, hardware controller  168  is mounted to wing  104 .  FIG. 24  shows another embodiment where hardware controller  168  is mounted to multicopter  108 . In other embodiments, some parts of hardware controller  168  may be separately mounted to different components of aerial vehicle  100 . For example, processor  176  may be mounted to multicopter  108 , and wireless receiver  172  may be mounted to body  102 . \\n     Referring to  FIGS. 3 and 4 , multicopter rotors  132  may be operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168  ( FIG. 1 )) to rotate their respective rotor blades  136  at different torques to control the thrust produced, and therefore control the acceleration and velocity of aerial vehicle  100 . Preferably, different multicopter rotors  132  may be selectively operable at different torques to produce different thrust than other multicopter rotors  132 . This may permit control over the rotation of multicopter  108  about multicopter axis  124  by modulating the torques of the different multicopter rotors  132 . For example, a positive or negative torque about the multicopter axis  124  may be developed by increasing or decreasing the relative torques of the multicopter rotor(s)  132  on one side of the multicopter axis  124  compared to the torques of the multicopter rotor(s)  132  on the other side of the multicopter axis  124 . In the illustrated example, multicopter  108  may be pitched forwardly (i.e. rotate counter-clockwise relative to gravity when viewed from the left) by producing greater thrust with the rear multicopter rotors  132   b  than the front multicopter rotors  132   a  (and vice versa). This may permit aerial vehicle  100  to transition between the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 3 ) and the fixed wing configuration ( FIG. 4 ). \\n     In some embodiments, multicopter rotors  132  may be operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168  ( FIG. 1 )), to reverse the rotary direction, and therefore reverse the rotor thrust direction  160 . For example, multicopter  108  may be rapidly pitched forwardly by producing upward thrust with the rear multicopter rotors  132   b , and downward thrust with the front multicopter rotors  132   a  (and vice versa). This may permit aerial vehicle  100  to transition quickly between the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 3 ) and the fixed wing configuration ( FIG. 4 ). \\n       FIG. 3  shows aerial vehicle  100  in a multicopter configuration. The multicopter configuration may provide the convenience of vertical takeoff and landing, and stationary hovering. As shown, in the multicopter configuration, multicopter  108  may be substantially parallel (e.g. co-planar) with wing  104  (e.g. parallel with wing axes  120  and  124  ( FIG. 1 )). In this orientation, multicopter rotors  132  may be upwardly facing with an upward (e.g. in the direction of gravity) multicopter thrust direction  128 . The magnitude of the multicopter thrust may determine whether aerial vehicle  100  rises, falls, or hovers at constant elevation. As shown, in the multicopter configuration one or more (or all) multicopter rotors may be at least partially (or completely) positioned inside of multicopter opening  112 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 25 , in some embodiments, multicopter  108  may be rotated out of the plane of wing  104  in the multicopter configuration. For example, multicopter  108  may be rotated substantially perpendicular to wing  104  with multicopter rotors  132  extending above and/or below wing  104 . This may reduce the drag from wing  104  during vertical takeoff and landing. Optionally, body  102  may be shaped to permit aerial vehicle  100  to be self-supporting on a surface below in the vertical orientation shown. For example, body  102  may include a vertical stabilizer  252  which extends transverse (e.g. perpendicular) to wing  104  to provide additional stability for landing. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 1 , in the multicopter configuration, free rotation between multicopter  108  and wing  104  may permit wind and/or air resistance to cause wing  104  to rotate about multicopter axis  124  (e.g. pitch forwardly or rearwardly in the example shown). In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  100  may include a brake  182  selectively operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to inhibit relative rotation between multicopter  108  and wing  104 . Brake  182  may be activated while multicopter  108  is in the multicopter configuration, and released to permit multicopter  108  to rotate relative to wing  104  to the fixed wing configuration. In some embodiments, brake  182  may be activated while in the fixed wing configuration. In some embodiments, brake  182  may be activated to lesser degrees to slow the rotation of wing  104  relative to multicopter  108 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 1 , as an alternative to brake  182 , or in addition to brake  182 , aerial vehicle  100  may include an actuator  184  (e.g. motor) operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to control the rotary orientation of wing  104  relative to multicopter  108 . Actuator  184  may be operated while multicopter  108  is in the multicopter configuration, or the fixed wing configuration, or both, and released when transitioning between the two modes to permit free rotation of multicopter  108  relative to wing  104 . In use, actuator  184  may be operable to make fine adjustments to the angle between multicopter  108  and wing  104  in support of steering aerial vehicle  100 . \\n     Referring to  FIGS. 1 and 3 , as an alternative to brake  182  and actuator  184 , or in addition to one or both of brake  182  and actuator  184 , aerial vehicle  100  may include a wing stabilization system  188 . Wing stabilization system  188  may include one or more rotors  192  which produce thrust to create torque for reorienting body  102  relative to multicopter  108 . For example, stabilization rotor(s)  192  may be selectively activated to control the pitch or roll of wing  104 . \\n     Wing stabilization system  188  may include any number of stabilization rotors  192 . For example, wing stabilization system  188  may include one or more stabilization rotors  192 . In the illustrated example, wing stabilization system  188  includes two stabilization rotors  192 , which may be selectively activated to develop thrust for providing torque for pitch control.  FIG. 5  shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle  100  including a wing stabilization system  188  with three stabilization rotors  192  for pitch and roll control.  FIGS. 20 and 24  show embodiments of aerial vehicle  100  including a wing stabilization system  188  with four stabilization rotors  192 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 1 , each stabilization rotor  192  may be positioned in a stabilization rotor aperture  196  which penetrates wing  104 . Stabilization rotors  192  and apertures  196  may be arranged in any positional arrangement about wing  104 . For example, stabilization rotors  192  and apertures  196  may be evenly or unevenly distributed about wing  104 . In some embodiments, stabilization rotors  192  and apertures  196  may be positioned on opposite sides of one or both of wing axes  116  and  120 . This may permit stabilization rotors  192  to provide thrust about opposite sides of the wing axis  116  or  120  for rotating wing  104  about that axis  116  or  120 . \\n     In the illustrated embodiment, wing stabilization system  188  includes a front stabilization rotor  192   a  in a front stabilization rotor aperture  196   a , and a rear stabilization rotor  192   b  in a rear stabilization rotor aperture  196 b. Rotors  192   a  and  192   b  may be selectively activated independently of multicopter rotors  132  for adjusting the pitch of wing  104  relative to multicopter  108 .  FIG. 5  shows another embodiment including a front stabilization rotor  192   a , a rear left stabilization rotor  192   b L, and a rear right stabilization rotor  192   b R. As shown, rear stabilization rotors  192   b L and  192   b R may be positioned on opposite sides of longitudinal wing axis  116  to control the roll of wing  104 . In the illustrated embodiment, rear stabilization rotors  192   b L and  192   b R may be selectively activated to control the roll of aerial vehicle  100  as a whole (i.e. including wing  104  and multicopter  108 ). \\n     Referring to  FIG. 3 , each stabilization rotor  192  may be oriented to provide thrust in any direction  200 . For example, all stabilization rotors  192  may have an upward thrust direction  200 , all stabilization rotors  192  may have a downward thrust direction  200 , or some stabilization rotors  192  may have an upward thrust direction  200  while other stabilization rotors  192  have a downward thrust direction  200 . In some embodiments, one or more (or all) stabilization rotors  192  may be operable to selectively change their thrust directions  200 . For example, a stabilization rotor  192  may be operable to reverse the rotation of its rotor blades  204  to invert its thrust direction  200 . \\n     Alternatively, or in addition, a stabilization rotor  192  may be rotatable to selectively face a different direction. For example,  FIG. 6  shows an embodiment where each stabilization rotor  192  is rotatably mounted to wing  104  by a stabilization rotor axle  208 . A motor  212  may be connected to each axle  208 . Motor  212  may be selectively operated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to rotate the connected stabilization rotor  192  to face a selected direction. \\n     Returning to  FIG. 3 , stabilization rotors  192  may be rigidly connected to wing  104 . As shown, each stabilization rotor  192  may have an upward thrust direction  200  that may or may not be reversible. In this example, wing  104  may be pitched forwardly or rearwardly by modulating the relative thrusts of front and rear stabilization rotors  192   a  and  192   b . Stabilization rotors  192  may also be activated to provide lift during either or both of the multicopter configuration and the fixed wing configuration. \\n     Similar to multicopter rotors  132 , each stabilization rotor  192  is operable to rotate its respective stabilization rotor blades  204  about its respective stabilization rotor axis  216 . For example, each stabilization rotor  192  may include a stabilization rotor motor  216  connected to the rotor blades  204  of that stabilization rotor  192 , as shown. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 4 , which shows aerial vehicle  100  in a fixed wing configuration. In this configuration, multicopter  108  may be independently rotated out of the plane of wing  104  to provide horizontal (e.g. forward) thrust. As shown, multicopter  108  may be rotated at an angle  220  to wing  104 . One or more (or all) multicopter rotors  132  may be at least partially (or completely) positioned outside of multicopter opening  112  in the fixed wing configuration (e.g. above or below wing  104 ). This may permit those multicopter rotors  132  to provide effective thrust for propelling wing  104  horizontally (e.g. forward along longitudinal axis  116 ). The shape of wing  104  (e.g. aerofoil shape) and/or the angle of attack of wing  104  may passively create lift for aerial vehicle  100  in response to forward movement of wing  104  through air. Optionally, stabilization rotors  192  (if present) may be activated to provide supplemental lift. \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 4 , multicopter  108  may be rotated to any angle  220  in the fixed wing configuration. For example, multicopter angle  220  may be greater than 10 degrees, such as 10-90 degrees. In the illustrated embodiment, angle  220  is approximately 45 degrees. At some multicopter angles  220  (e.g. less than 90 degrees), multicopter thrust direction  128  may deviate from horizontal (i.e. be non-horizontal) so that multicopter thrust direction  128  may have both upward and forward components to provide both lift and forward thrust. At some other multicopter angles  220  (e.g. 90 degrees), multicopter thrust direction  128  may be substantially horizontal so that multicopter  108  may contribute forward thrust with little or no lift. \\n     Referring back to  FIG. 1 , aerial vehicle  100  may include one or more devices for stabilizing the orientation of wing  104 . For example, aerial vehicle  100  may include one or more of a brake  182 , actuator  184 , and wing stabilization system  188 , as described above. Alternative, or in addition to any one or more of these devices, aerial vehicle  100  may include one or more control surfaces  224 . Control surfaces  224  may be movably mounted (e.g. pivotably mounted) to wing  104 . The movement of control surfaces  224  may be controlled (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to operate as ailerons for controlling roll, to operate as elevators for controlling pitch, to operate as a rudder to control yaw, or a combination thereof depending on the number, size, position, and orientation of control surfaces  224 . In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle  100  is shown including two control surfaces  224  symmetrically disposed on opposite sides of wing longitudinal axis  116 , on a rear end  228  of wing  104 . Each control surface  224  may be individually activated (e.g. pivoted upwardly or downwardly) by actuators (e.g. motors  232 ) to create drag for controlling roll and steering of aerial vehicle  100 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 7 , in some embodiments, body  102  may include a tail  236  which extends rearwardly from wing  104 . In the illustrated embodiment, tail  236  is a passive tail without control surfaces. Tail  236  may be rigidly connected to wing  104  to provide drag which may help to orient aerial vehicle  100  so that aerial vehicle  100  tends to travel in a forward direction  240  in the fixed wing configuration. Tail  236  may be made of any material, which may be flexible or rigid. In some embodiments, tail  236  may be made of a flexible material, such as a sheet of flexible plastic. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 8 , in some embodiments, tail  236  may be an active tail including one or more control surfaces  224 . As shown, tail  236  may include a vertical stabilizer  252  including a vertical control surface  224 , which may act as a rudder for influencing yaw. Tail  236  may be rigidly connected to wing  104 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 9 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  300  in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As exemplified, aerial vehicle  300  may include a body  102  having a frame  304 , wings  308 , and a tail  312 . A multicopter  108  is positioned in a multicopter opening  112  of frame  304 . Further, multicopter  108  is freely rotatably mounted to frame  304  similarly to how multicopter  108  is freely rotatably mounted to wing  104  in aerial vehicle  100  (see  FIG. 1 ). This may permit multicopter  108  to rotate about multicopter axis  124  independently of the frame  304 , wings  308 , and tail  312  for transitioning between the multicopter configuration and the fixed wing configuration, as described above with respect to aerial vehicle  100 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 9 , each wing  308  may extend laterally outwardly from vehicle frame  304 . Wings  308  may have a cross-sectional shape suitable for producing lift in response to forward movement through air. For example, each wing  308  may be shaped as an aerofoil. This may permit wings  308  to contribute lift to aerial vehicle  300  when operating in the fixed wing configuration where multicopter  108  may be oriented forwardly to provide forward thrust. \\n     As exemplified, tail  312  may extend rearwardly from vehicle frame  304 . Tail  312  may be directly connected in contact with vehicle frame  304  or rearwardly spaced apart from vehicle frame  304 . In the illustrated embodiment, tail  312  is shown rearwardly spaced apart from vehicle frame  304  by a tail bracket  316 . Tail  312  may be a passive tail without control surfaces (e.g. similar to tail  236  of  FIG. 7 ), or tail may be an active tail with one or more control surfaces (e.g. similar to tail  236  of  FIG. 8 ). In the illustrated embodiment, tail  312  is an active tail formed as a control surface  224 . Control surface  224  may be selectively rotatable (e.g. pivotable) upwardly and downwardly by activating control surface motor  232  (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ). This may permit control surface  224  to create drag to operate as an elevator for influencing the pitch of aerial vehicle  300 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 9 , frame  304  may have any shape. In the illustrated example, frame  304  is substantially square in top plan view. In alternative embodiments, frame  304  may have another regular shape (e.g. circular, triangular, octagonal) or an irregular shape. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 21 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  600  in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle  600  may include a body  102 , including a frame  304  and wings  308 . In the illustrated example, wings  308  extend laterally outwardly of frame  304  along lateral wing axis  120 . Frame  304  is shown extending downwardly, transverse to wings  120 . Multicopter  108  is rotatably mounted (e.g. freely rotatably mounted) to frame  304  similarly to how multicopter  108  is rotatably mounted to wing  104  in aerial vehicle  100  (see  FIG. 1 ). As exemplified, multicopter axis  124  may extend parallel to and spaced apart below lateral wing axis  120 . \\n     In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  600  may further include a counterweight  602  mounted to body  102 . As shown, counterweight  602  may be permanently or removably mounted to the bottom of frame  304 . Counterweight  602  may help to maintain aerial vehicle  600  oriented so that frame  304  (and multicopter  108 ) extends below wings  308 . In some embodiments, counterweight  602  may be a functional component, such as an energy source (e.g. batteries or fuel). In alternative embodiments, aerial vehicle  600  may not include counterweight  602 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 22 , in some embodiments, wings  308  may be upwardly or downwardly rotatable relative to multicopter  108 . For example, wings  308  may be rotated upwardly as shown or downwardly, in the multicopter configuration or for compact storage. In the multicopter configuration, turning wings  308  upwardly or downwardly may reduce the resistance from wings  308  during vertical takeoff and landing, and may permit aerial vehicle  300  to land in a smaller area. \\n     Wings  308  may be upwardly or downwardly rotatable relative to multicopter  108  by any wing angle  320 . For example, wing angle  320  may be less than 30 degrees, such as 0 degrees, in the fixed wing configuration, and wing angle  320  may be at least 30 degrees, such as 90 degrees in the multicopter configuration. \\n     Wings  308  may be upwardly or downwardly rotatable relative to multicopter  108  in any manner. As exemplified, wings  308  may be pivotably connected to frame  304 . Wing motors  324  may be selectively activated (e.g. by control signals from controller  168 ) to rotate wings  308  to the desired wing angle  320 . In an alternative embodiment, upward or downward rotation of wings  308  may be exclusively manually operated (e.g. free of electronic actuators) or additionally manually operated for the purpose of making aerial vehicle  300  more compact for storage. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 15  where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  500  in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle  500  may include a body  102 , including a wing  104  and a tail  236 . Body  102  is shown positioned between rotors  136  of multicopter  108 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  136  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by a multicopter axle  148  which extends laterally across and outboard of wing  104 . As exemplified, this allows body  102  to be free of multicopter openings  112  ( FIG. 1 ), which may enhance the aerodynamics of body  102 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 15 , multicopter  108  is rotatable as a whole (i.e. a unitary element) about multicopter axis  124  relative to body  102 . That is, all multicopter rotors  136  of multicopter  108  are collectively rotatable about multicopter axis  124  relative to body  102 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 10  where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  400  in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle  400  may be shaped as a traditional airplane including a body  102  having a fuselage  404 , wings  308 , and a tail  236 . Multicopter  108  may be positioned in multicopter opening  112  formed in fuselage  404 , and freely rotatably mounted to fuselage  404  analogously to the description above with respect to the mounting of multicopter  108  in aerial vehicle  100 . \\n     As shown, tail  236  may include a tailplane  244  including left and right horizontal stabilizers  248 , and a vertical stabilizer  252 . One or more (or all) of stabilizers  248  and  252  may include a control surface  224 . In the illustrated example, each horizontal stabilizer  248  includes a horizontal control surface  224 , which may act as elevators for influencing pitch, and vertical stabilizer  252  includes a vertical control surface  224 , which may act as a rudder for influencing yaw. Tail  236  may be formed of any material, which may be rigid for example. \\n     Fuselage  404  may provide storage capacity for transporting cargo and/or passengers as in a traditional airplane. Multicopter  108  may provide lift for vertical takeoff and landing in the multicopter configuration. Wings  308  may be appropriately shaped (e.g. as aerofoils) to provide lift in the fixed wing configuration where multicopter  108  is angled forwardly to provide forward thrust. One or both of wings  308  and tail  236  may include one or more control surfaces  224 , which may act as ailerons, elevators, rudders, or combinations thereof. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 11 . As an alternative to or in addition to positioning a multicopter  108  in a multicopter opening  112  formed in fuselage  404 , aerial vehicle  400  may include one or more multicopters  108   b  positioned in multicopter openings  112  in wings  308 . Each multicopter  108   b  may be freely hingedly mounted to a respective wing  308  analogously to the description above with respect to the mounting of multicopter  108  in aerial vehicle  100 . In one aspect, multicopters  108   b  may provide enhanced control over the roll of aerial vehicle  400 . For example, multicopters  108   b  may be controlled to produce different magnitudes of thrust to influence the roll of aerial vehicle  400 . In another aspect, multicopters  108   b  may substitute a multicopter positioned in fuselage  404  as shown, which may permit fuselage  404  to carry more cargo and/or passengers. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 20 , which shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle  100 . In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle  100  includes a multicopter  108  rotatably mounted (e.g. freely rotatably mounted) in a multicopter opening  112 . As shown, body  102  is free of control surfaces. Instead, stabilization system  188  may include four stabilization rotors  192 . In some embodiments, stabilization rotors  192  may be operated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) in the fixed-wing configuration for steering (e.g. to pitch and roll wing  104 ). \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 12 . In some embodiments aerial vehicle  100  may be configured to carry one or more articles of cargo  256  (referred to herein as packages). For example, aerial vehicle  100  may include one or more releasable cargo mounts  260  for holding packages  256  (e.g. suspended below wing  104 ). Cargo mounts  260  may include any retention members (e.g. straps, arms, brackets, etc.), and may be manually releasable (e.g. by hand), and/or electronically releasable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ). This may permit aerial vehicle  100  to operate as a delivery drone for delivering packages (e.g. to fulfill internet orders). \\n     Aerial vehicle  100  may include any number of cargo mounts  260 . For example, aerial vehicle  100  may include 1 or more cargo mounts. In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle  100  includes  8  cargo mounts. \\n     Cargo mounts  260  may have any size. For example, all cargo mounts  260  may be configured for holding similarly sized packages  256  as shown, or at least one cargo mount  260  may be configured for holding a differently sized (e.g. larger or smaller) package  256 . In some cases, cargo mounts  260  may be adjustable for holding a variety of package sizes, and/or combinable for holding larger sized packages  256  (e.g. double, triple, or quadruple sized packages  256 ). \\n     Cargo mounts  260  may be positionally arranged in any manner about aerial vehicle  100 . For example, cargo mounts  260  may be arranged to hold packages aligned in rows, columns, or arbitrary positions about aerial vehicle  100 . In the illustrated embodiment, cargo mounts  260  are positioned to hold packages  256  in a single file row proximate each of the left and right sides  264  and  268  of wing  104 . Cargo mounts  260  may be connected to any portion of aerial vehicle  100 . For example, cargo mounts  260  may be connected to the body  102  of aerial vehicle  100 , such as to wing  104 . \\n     It will be appreciated that packages  256  may act to laterally and/or longitudinally offset the center of gravity of aerial vehicle  100 . For example, packages  256  may be asymmetrically arranged about wing  104 , or packages  256  may be asymmetrically weighted about wing  104 . The asymmetry of packages  256  may be further aggravated upon releasing (e.g. delivering) a subset of packages  256  being carried by aerial vehicle  100 . Unless compensated for, an offset center of gravity may cause aerial vehicle  100  to unwantedly pitch, roll, or yaw. \\n     In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  100  may include a mass balancing system  272  mounted to the body  102  of aerial vehicle  100  (e.g. connected to wing  104 ). Mass balancing system  272  may include one or more masses  276  (e.g. relatively heavy solid object or liquid volume) which is selectively movable to help restore the center of gravity of aerial vehicle  100 . In some embodiments, masses  276  may be a functional component such as an energy source (e.g. battery or fuel). Each mass  276  may be movable in any direction. For example, mass  276  may be laterally movable as shown, longitudinally movable (see  FIG. 13 ), or both. In a simple example, if a package  256  is released from the left side of aerial vehicle  100 , then mass  276  may be moved leftwardly to compensate. \\n     Mass  276  may be movable in any manner. For example, mass  276  may be movable manually (e.g. by hand), or electronically (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ). In the illustrated embodiment, mass  276  is a solid object mounted to slide along a rail  280 . In this example, a motor  284  (which may constitute mass  276  or contribute to the weight of mass  276 ) may be connected to mass  276  for moving mass  276  along rail  280 . For example, motor  284  may be mounted to mass  276  and drive a sprocket or wheel (not shown) which engages rail  280  to move mass  276  along rail  280 . \\n     It will be appreciated that as an alternative to, or in addition to mass balancing system  272 , aerial vehicle  100  may include a wing stabilization system  188  and/or control surfaces  224  to help counteract pitch, yaw, or roll caused by mass imbalances. For example,  FIG. 12  shows an example including a mass balancing system  272  with a laterally movable mass  276  which may compensate for lateral mass imbalance that might cause roll, and a pitch stabilization system  188  which may be operable to compensate for longitudinal mass imbalance that might cause pitch. Similarly,  FIGS. 13 and 14  show examples including a mass balancing system  272 , with one or more longitudinally movable masses  276 , which may compensate for longitudinal mass imbalance that might cause pitch, and a pitch stabilization system  188  which may be operable to compensate for lateral mass imbalance that might cause roll. In  FIG. 13 , mass  276  is longitudinally movable along a range of motion defined by rail  280  which is centered laterally and positioned forwardly of multicopter  108 . In  FIG. 14 , two masses  276  are longitudinally movable along separate paths defined by separate rails  280  which are laterally outboard of opposite sides of multicopter  108 , and which extend forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter  108 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 23 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the other figures, and where an aerial vehicle  700  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, body  102  may include frame  304 , wings  308 , and cargo holds  702 . Cargo holds  702  may provide storage for packages  256 . Packages  256  can be manually stored in cargo holds  702 . Optionally, packages  256  may be selectively jettisoned (e.g. by control signals) from cargo holds  702  (e.g. to complete a package delivery). \\n     Cargo holds  702  may be positioned anywhere on aerial vehicle  700 . In the illustrated example, cargo holds  702  are positioned forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter  108 . This may help to distribute the weight of packages  256  on aerial vehicle  700 . \\n     It will be appreciated that in any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the body  102  of the aerial vehicle ( 100 ,  200 ,  300 ,  400 ,  500 ,  600 , or  700 ) may be provided as a subassembly (e.g. retrofit kit) for attachment with a compatible (e.g. appropriately sized) multicopter  108 . This allows an existing multicopter  108  to be enhanced with a fixed wing configuration. \\n       FIG. 16  shows an example of body  102  of aerial vehicle  100  of  FIG. 1 , which is suitable for attachment to an existing multicopter. Body  102  may be connected to a multicopter in any manner that allows the multicopter to rotate about the multicopter axis  124 . In the illustrated embodiment, wing  104  of body  102  includes an axle  148  which extends across multicopter opening  112  and which is rotatably mounted to wing  104  by axle bearings  156 . As shown, a multicopter mounting bracket  288  may be secured to axle  148  in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, straps, or by integrally forming multicopter mounting bracket  288  and axle  148 . A multicopter may be rigidly fastened to multicopter mounting bracket  288  in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, or straps. In some embodiments, multicopter mounting bracket  288  may accommodate a releasable connection to a multicopter so that the multicopter can be selectively disconnected from body  102  as desired. \\n     In alternative embodiments, axle  148  may be rigidly connected to wing  104  in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, or by integrally forming axle  148  and wing  104 . In this case, multicopter mounting bracket  288  may be rotatably mounted to axle  148  in any manner suitable for allowing the multicopter connected to mounting bracket  288  to rotate about multicopter axis  124 . \\n       FIG. 19  shows another example of a body  102  suitable for attachment to an existing multicopter. As shown, body  102  may include stabilization system  188 , wings  308  with control surfaces  224   c , and tail  312  with control surface  224   a . As with the embodiment of  FIG. 16 , body  102  may be connected to a multicopter in any manner that allows the multicopter to rotate about the multicopter axis  124 . In the illustrated embodiment, frame  304  of body  102  includes an axle  148  which extends across multicopter opening  112  and which is rotatably mounted to frame  304  by axle bearings  156 . As shown, a multicopter mounting bracket  288  may be secured to axle  148  in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, straps, or by integrally forming multicopter mounting bracket  288  and axle  148 . As described with respect to  FIG. 16 , a multicopter may be rigidly fastened to multicopter mounting bracket  288  in any manner, multicopter mounting bracket  288  may accommodate a releasable connection to a multicopter, and axle  148  may alternatively be rigidly connected to frame  304  and multicopter mounting bracket  288  rotatably mounted to axle  148 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 17 , aerial vehicle  300  may provide simplified movement control. For example, in some embodiments, aerial vehicle  3  may have seven degrees of freedom and effectively seven actuators, which may be mapped to a square 7\u00d77 matrix. As a square matrix, it is invertible and single-solution. This may reduce the computational demand on hardware controller  168 . For example, when a user directs hardware controller  168  (e.g. by remote control) to produce a specific movement in one or more of the seven degrees of freedom, the hardware controller  168  may resolve a single solution (e.g. a single set of instructions for the seven actuators). In contrast, where there are more actuators than degrees of freedom (e.g. an 8\u00d77 matrix), there will be several solutions for each movement scenario, which may require hardware controller  168  to assess and select the best solution. This may be more computationally intensive. Still, in some embodiments, aerial vehicle  300  has more actuators than degrees of freedom. \\n     The seven degrees of freedom include movement along three axes (e.g. x, y, z) and rotation about the three axes (e.g. roll, yaw, and pitch), as well as rotation of the body  102  about multicopter axis  124  relative to multicopter  108 . In the illustrated embodiment, the seven actuators may include the four multicopter rotors  132 , the two control surfaces  224   c  of wings  308 , and the control surface  224   a  of tail  312 . The rotational connection between multicopter  108  and wing  104  may be unactuated (i.e. free of torque producing devices). \\n     In some embodiments, a group of two or more actuators may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator. As used herein, and in the claims, a group of actuators are said to operate \u201csynchronously\u201d where those actuators are operated according to a predefined fixed relationship. For example, hardware controller  168  may be configured to control two synchronously operated actuators according to a predefined relationship which may be to actuate the two actuators identically, oppositely, or according to one or more mathematical correlations. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 1 , aerial vehicle  100  may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors  132 , the two stabilization rotors  192 , and the two control surfaces  224 . In this example, the two stabilization rotors  192  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, or the two control surfaces  224  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 8 , aerial vehicle  100  may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors  132 , the two stabilization rotors  192 , the two control surfaces  224   a , and the control surface  224   b . In this example, the two stabilization rotors  192  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, and the two control surfaces  224  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator. \\n     Referring to  FIG. 18 , aerial vehicle  300  may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors  132 , the two stabilization rotors  192 , the one control surface  224   a , and the two control surfaces  224   c . In this example, the two stabilization rotors  192  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, and the two control surfaces  224   c  may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 26 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  800  in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle  800  may include a body  102  including a wing  104 , which is positioned between rotors  132  of multicopter  108 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  136  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by a multicopter linkage  802  which extends forwardly and rearwardly of wing  104 . This allows body  102  to be free of multicopter openings  112  ( FIG. 1 ), which may enhance the aerodynamics of body  102 , and make multicopter  108  more easily retrofitted to existing aerial vehicles. \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 26 , multicopter  108  may include one or more first multicopter rotors  132   1 , and one or more second multicopter rotors  132   2  connected to wing  104  by a multicopter linkage  802 . First multicopter rotors  132   1  may be positioned forwardly of second multicopter rotors  132   2 . In the illustrated example of a multicopter configuration, the first multicopter rotors  132   1  are positioned forwardly of wing  104 , and the second multicopter rotors  132   2  are positioned rearwardly of wing  104 . Multicopter linkage  802  allows the first multicopter rotors  132   1  to rotate about a first axis  806 , and allows the second multicopter rotors  132   2  about a second axis  810 , for moving between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     Multicopter  108  may include any number of first and second multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2 .  FIG. 27  shows an example of multicopter  108  including one first multicopter rotor  132   1 , and one second multicopter rotor  132   2 . In the illustrated example, aerial vehicle  800  may further include control surfaces  224  for additional control.  FIG. 28  shows an example of multicopter  108  include one first multicopter rotor  132   1 , and two second multicopter rotors  132   2 .  FIG. 29  shows an example of multicopter  108  including two first multicopter rotors  132   1 , and two multicopter rotors  132   2 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 30 and 31 , which show aerial vehicle  800  in a multicopter configuration and a fixed-wing configuration, respectively. Multicopter linkage  802  may be any mechanical linkage that connects the first and second multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  to wing  104  and allows the first and second multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  to rotate about spaced apart first and second axes  806  and  810 , respectively. \\n     Multicopter linkage  802  synchronizes the movement of multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. This may optionally allow aerial vehicle  800  to be constructed free of actuators or other devices which directly apply torque to rotate multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  about axes  806  and  810 , respectively. Instead, the thrust developed by multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  may be controlled (e.g. by hardware controller  168 ) to cause multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  to move between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, substantially as described with respect to other embodiments. In other embodiments, aerial vehicle  800  may include one or more actuators or brakes (not shown) for moving or restricting the movement of multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     In some embodiments, multicopter linkage  802  operates as a four-bar linkage. As shown, multicopter linkage  802  may include a first rotor arm  814  connected to multicopter rotor  132   1 , a second rotor arm  818  connected to multicopter rotor  132   2 , and a connecting arm  822 . The first rotor arm is rotatably connected to wing  104  for rotation about the first axis  806 , the second rotor arm is rotatably connected to wing  104  for rotation about the second axis  810 , and connecting arm  822  is rotatably connected to both of the first and second rotor arms  814  and  818  for tying the rotation of the first and second rotor arms  814  and  818  together. For example, clockwise rotation of first multicopter rotor  132   1  about first axis  806  relative to wing  104  moves connecting arm  822  which causes second multicopter rotor  132   2  to rotate clockwise about second axis  810  relative to wing  104 . \\n     Rotor arms  814  and  818  may be rotatably connected to wing  104  in any manner that allows rotor arms  814  and  818  to rotate about first and second axes  806  and  810 , respectively. In the illustrated example, first rotor arm  814  is shown rotatably mounted to a first mount  826  that is rigidly connected to an underside  827  of wing  104 . Similarly, second rotor arm  818  is shown rotatably mounted to a second mount  830  that is rigidly connected to the underside of wing  104 . As shown, first and second mounts  826  and  830  extend from wing  104  downwardly to provide rotary connections  834  and  838 , respectively, which are spaced apart from wing  104 . In other embodiments, one or both of first and second mounts  826  and  830  may be connected to an upper side  829  of wing  104  and extend upwardly. In alternative embodiments, aerial vehicle  800  may not include one or both of mounts  826  and  830 , and instead one or both of rotor arms  814  and  818  may be directly rotatably connected to wing  104 . \\n     First and second axes  806  and  810  may be positioned anywhere relative to wing  104  that allows first and second multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  move between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. In the illustrated example, first and second axes  806  and  810  are parallel and spaced apart, with first axis  806  positioned forward of second axis  810 . As shown, first and second axes  806  and  810  may be spaced apart from wing  104 , and positioned below wing  104 . In alternative embodiments, one or both of first and second axes  806  and  810  may be positioned above wing  104 . In some embodiments, one or both of axes  806  and  810  may extend through (e.g. be coincident with) wing  104 . \\n     In the illustrated embodiment, first axis  806  is positioned rearward of wing front end  842 , and second axis  810  is positioned forward of wing rear end  846 . In alternative embodiments, first axis  806  may be positioned forward of wing front end  842 , second axis  810  may be positioned rearward of wing rear end  846 , or both. \\n     Still referring to  FIGS. 30 and 31 , connecting arm  822  may be connected to first and second rotor arms  814  and  818  in any manner that allows connector arm  822  to synchronize the movement of first and second rotor arms  814  and  818 . In the illustrated embodiment, connector arm  822  is rotatably connected to first rotor arm  814  at first arm rotary connection  850 , and connector arm  822  is rotatably connected to second rotor arm  818  at second arm rotary connection  854 . As shown, first and second arm rotary connections  850  and  854  are spaced apart from first and second mount rotary connections  834  and  838  respectively. In this way, connection arm  822  may be made to move whenever either of rotor arms  814  or  818  rotates about first or second axis  806  or  810 . \\n     First and second rotor arms  814  and  818  may have any shape suitable for moving first and second multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. In the illustrated example, first and second rotor arms  814  and  818  are shown each including first and second arm portions  858  and  862 . The first arm portion  858  is rotatably connected to wing  104  and connecting arm  822 , and the second arm portion  862  joins a multicopter rotor  132  to first arm portion  858 . In the illustrated embodiment, wing  104  and connecting arm  822  are rotatably mounted to first and second ends  866  and  870  of first arm portion  858 , respectively. Second arm portion  862  has a first end  874  connected to first arm portion first end  866 , and a second end  878  connected to multicopter rotor  132 . \\n       FIGS. 32 and 33  show an embodiment of aerial vehicle  800  where connecting arm  822  is rotatably mounted to first arm portion  858  of second rotor arm  818  between first and second ends  866  and  870 , and second arm portion  862  of second rotor arm  818  is connected to first arm portion second end  870 . As shown, this can help to provide clearance between wing  104  and second rotor arm  818  in the fixed-wing configuration to allow greater range of motion between the multicopter configuration and the fixed-wing configuration. \\n       FIGS. 34 and 35  show an embodiment of aerial vehicle  800  where second arm portion  862  of second rotor arm  818  includes a concave portion  882 . As shown, concave portion  882  may receive a wing rear end  846  to provide clearance between wing  104  and second rotor arm  818  in the fixed-wing configuration for greater range of motion between the multicopter configuration and the fixed-wing configuration. \\n     Multicopter rotors  132  may be positioned in any position relative to wing  104  that allows multicopter rotors  132  to contribute lift in the multicopter configuration, and to contribute forward thrust in the fixed-wing configuration. In the multicopter configuration, first multicopter rotors  132   1  may be positioned forward of wing front end  842 , and second multicopter rotors  132   2  may be positioned rearward of wing rear end  846 . This allows the air streams through multicopter rotors  132  to pass substantially uninterrupted by wing  104 . In alternative embodiments, one or more (or all) of multicopter rotors  132  may be partially or entirely positioned between the wing front and rear ends  842  and  846 . \\n     In the multicopter configuration, first multicopter rotors  132   1  may be coplanar with second multicopter rotors  132   2 , as shown in  FIG. 30 . Alternatively, first multicopter rotors  132   1  may be vertically offset from second multicopter rotors  132   2  in the multicopter configuration, as shown in  FIG. 32 . \\n     In the fixed-wing configuration, a portion (or all) of first multicopter rotor  132   1  may be positioned below wing  104 , and a portion (or all) of second multicopter rotor  132   2  may be positioned above wing  104 , as shown in  FIG. 31 . As shown, first multic 8 opter rotor  132   1  may be forward of wing front end  842  and second multicopter rotor  132   2  may be rearward of wing rear end  846  in the fixed-wing configuration.  FIG. 33  shows an embodiment where first multicopter rotor  132   1  is at least partially rearward of wing front end  842  in the fixed-wing configuration.  FIG. 35  shows an embodiment where second multicopter rotor  132   2  is forward of wing rear end  846  in the fixed-wing configuration. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 36 , which shows an aerial vehicle  900 . Multicopter linkage  902  includes two coupled linkages similar to linkages  802  shown in previous embodiments. First and second multicopter rotors  132   1A  and  132   2A  are mounted to wing  104  through rotor arms  914   A ,  918   A  and connecting arms  922   A . First and second multicopter rotors  132   1B  and  132   2B  are mounted to wing  104  through rotor arms  914   B ,  918   B  and connecting arms  922   B . Connecting arms  922   A  and  922   B  are rigidly coupled through crossbar  924  such that connecting arms  922 A,  922 B and crossbar  924  move as a unit. Rotors  132  move in unison through movement of multicopter linkage  902  such that rotors  1321  rotate together about axis  906  and rotors  1322  rotate together about axis  910 . Aerial vehicle  900  may have no actuators other devices that apply torque directly to rotate rotors  132  about axes  906  and  910 . In other embodiments, multicopter linkage  902  may actuated or braked to allow the rotation of rotors  132  about axes  906  and  910  to be controlled. \\n     Reference is next made to  FIG. 37  which shows an aerial vehicle  1000  that is similar to aerial vehicle  900 . The use of use like reference numerals identifies like components. Aerial vehicle  1000  has a fuselage  1026  and a pair of wings  1004 A and  1004 B on opposite sides of the fuselage. Multicopter linkage  902  is mounted to wings  1004 A and  1004 B in a manner similar to that described above in relation to previous embodiments. Fuselage  1026  may be used to carry cargo or passengers. \\n     It will be appreciated that multicopter  108  of aerial vehicle  800  may be provided as a retrofit kit for attachment to a wing  104 . The retrofit kit may include at least multicopter rotors  108 , multicopter linkage  802 , and hardware controller  168 . Optionally, the retrofit kit may further include mounts  826  and  830  for connecting the multicopter  108  to the wing. The retrofit kit allows an existing wing  104  (e.g. of a fixed-wing aerial vehicle) to be enhanced with a multicopter configuration. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 38 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  1000  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle  1000  includes a body  102  including a wing  104 , which is positioned between rotors  132  of multicopter  108 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  132  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by a multicopter linkage  1004  which extends forwardly and rearwardly of wing  104 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 42 , aerial vehicle  1000  is similar to aerial vehicle  800  in many respects, except for example the configuration of the multicopter linkage  1004 , which now includes a sensor mount  1008 . As shown, multicopter linkage  1004  includes a wing mount  1012 , a plurality of rotor arms  1016 , and a connecting arm  1020  connected to wing mount  1012  by rotor arms  1016 . Collectively, wing mount  1012 , rotor arms  1016 , and connecting arm  1020  form a four-bar linkage that is movable relative to wing  104  between the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 38 ) and a fixed-wing configuration seen in  FIG. 39 . \\n     Referring to  FIGS. 40-41 , rotor arms  1016  include a front arm  1016   1  and a rear arm  1016   2 . Each arm  1016  has a rotor arm first end  1024  connected to wing mount  1012 , and a rotor arm second end  1028  connected to connecting arm  1020 . Each rotor arm  1016  can be connected to wing mount  1012  in any manner that allows the rotor arm  1016  to rotate with respect wing mount  1012  about a respective lateral axis  1032 . Similarly, each rotor arm  1016  can be connected to connecting arm  1020  in any manner that allows rotor arms  1016  to rotate with respect to connecting arm  1020  about a respective lateral axis  1036 . In the illustrated example, rotor arms  1016  are rotatably connected to wing mount  1012  by a first rotary connection formed by first axles  1040 , and rotor arms  1016  are rotatably connected to connecting arm  1020  by a second rotary connection formed by second axles  1044 . As shown, axles  1040  extend parallel to lateral axes  1032 , and second axles  1044  extend parallel to lateral axes  1036 . Lateral axis  1032   1  is longitudinally spaced apart from lateral axis  1032   2 , and lateral axis  1036   1  is longitudinal spaced apart from lateral axis  1036   2 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 42 , wing mount  1012  can be any device configured to accommodate a connection to a wing  104  and rotor arms  1016 . In the illustrated example, wing mount  1012  is formed as a rigid open frame including a wing mount upper surface  1048  that is shaped to support wing  104 . Wing  104  may be connected to wing mount  1012  in any manner, such as by one or more of fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, or magnets, for example. In alternative embodiments, wing  104  and wing mount  1012  are integrally formed. fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, or magnets, for example. In alternative embodiments, wing  104  and wing mount  1012  are integrally formed. Each rotor arm  1016  is connected to one or more rotors  132 , and rotationally connected to wing mount  1012  and connecting arm  1020 . In the illustrated embodiment, each rotor arm  1016  is formed as a rigid frame. As shown, rotor arm  1016  may include rotor arm trusses  1052  to enhance strength and rigidity. \\n     Each rotor arm  1016  can be coupled to one or more multicopter rotors  132  in any manner that allows multicopter rotor  132  to rotate together with rotor arm  1016  between the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 38 ) and the fixed-wing configuration ( FIG. 39 ). For example, rotor arm  1016  may accommodate a rigid connection with one or more multicopter rotors  132  so that the rotor arm  1016  and multicopter rotors  132  behave as a unitary element. In the illustrated example, each rotor arm  1016  includes two rotor mounts  1056  for connecting two multicopter rotors  132 . As shown, the rotor mounts  1056  of each rotor arm  1016  are laterally spaced apart to connect with laterally spaced apart multicopter rotors  132 . Each multicopter rotor  132  is shown supported on a rotor rod  1068 , which is connected to a rotor arm  1016  by a rotor mount  1056 . Rotor rods  1068  can connect with rotor arms  1016  in any manner, such as by one or more of fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, interference fit, or magnets, for example. In the illustrated example, rotor mounts  1056  are formed as clamps, which receive a proximal end  1072  of a rotor arm  1016  and tighten with fasteners  1076 . \\n     Rotor rods  1068  can have any size and shape. In some embodiments, a rotor rod  1068  is shaped to provide a rigid connection between a multicopter rotor  132  and a rotor arm  1016  so that the rotor rod  1068  and rotor arm  1016  behave a unitary element. In the illustrated example, rotor rods  1068  are formed as shafts with non-circular (e.g. rectangular) cross-section. This can provide rotor rods  1068  with enhanced rigidity and resistance to axial rotation relative to rotor arm  1016 . In alternative embodiments, a rotor rod  1068  is integrally formed or permanently connected with a rotor arm  1016 . \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 42 , in some embodiment aerial vehicle  1000  includes a tail  236 . Tail  236  can be connected to wing  104  in any manner. For example, multicopter linkage  1004  or wing  104  may be configured to accommodate a connection to tail  236 . In the illustrated embodiment, tail  236  is connected to wing mount  1012  by a tail rod  1080 . Tail rod  1080  can be connected to wing mount  1012  in any manner. For example, tail rod  1080  can be connected to wing mount  1012  by one or more of fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, interference fit, or magnets, for example. In the illustrated embodiment, wing mount  1012  includes a tail mount  1084  sized and positioned to receive tail rod  1080 . As shown, tail mount  1084  may include a receptacle (e.g. recess or aperture) sized to receive tail rod proximal end  1088 . In alternative embodiment, tail rod  1080  is integrally formed with wing  104  or multicopter linkage  1004 . For example, tail rod  1080  may be integrally formed with wing mount  1012 . \\n     Tail  236  can be an active tail with one or more control surfaces  224  as shown, or a passive tail free of control surfaces. In the illustrated example, tail  236  includes a tail actuator  1092  to control the position of control surface  224 . Tail actuator  1092  can be any device that can be electronically actuated to move control surface  224 . In the illustrated example, tail actuator  1092  includes a tail motor  1096 , and a tail linkage  1100  that drivingly connects tail motor  1096  to control surface  224 . Tail linkage  1100  converts rotary movement of tail motor  1096  into pivotal movement of control surface  224 . As shown, tail linkage  1100  includes a first arm  1104  rigidly connected to tail motor output shaft  1116 , a second arm  1108  rigidly connected to control surface  224 , and a third arm  1112  rotatably connected to first and second arms  1104  and  1108 . Actuation of tail motor  1096  rotates tail motor output shaft  1116  and therefore first arm  1104 , which pulls or pushes on third arm  1112 , which rotates second arm  1108  and therefore control surface  224  upwardly or downwardly. \\n     Returning to  FIG. 42 , multicopter linkage  1004  includes a sensor mount  1008 . Sensor mount  1008  can be any device configured to accommodate a connection to a movement sensor  1120   1 , and that rotates with multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 38 ) and the fixed wing configuration ( FIG. 39 ). This allows a connected hardware controller  168  to determine the position of multicopter rotors  132 , in respect of movement between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, based on readings from the movement sensor  1120   1 . Movement sensor  1120   1  can include one or more of accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and rotation sensors for example. In some embodiments, movement sensor  1120   1  is an inertial measurement unit. \\n     Sensor mount  1008  can be connected to multicopter rotors  132  in any manner that allows a connected movement sensor  1120   1  to move with multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter and fixed wing configurations. In the illustrated embodiment, sensor mount  1008  includes laterally opposed sensor mount arms  1024   1  and  1024   2 , each of which is rotatably connected to wing mount  1012  and connecting arm  1020  by axles  1040   3  and  1044   3  respectively. This allows sensor mount  1008  to pivot forwardly and rearwardly relative to wing mount  1012  (and wing  104 ) as multicopter linkage  1004  (and rotors  132 ) moves between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. Movement sensor  1120   1  reports on this movement with sensor readings that allow hardware controller  168  to determine the position of multicopter rotors  132 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 41 , sensor mount  1008  can accommodate a connection with a movement sensor  1120   1  in any manner. For example, sensor  1120   1  may be connected to sensor mount  1008  by one or more of fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, interference fit, or magnets, for example. In the illustrated example, each sensor mount arm  1124  includes a mounting platform  1128  with receptacles  1132  (e.g. recesses or apertures) sized to receive a fastener  1136  (e.g. screw, bolt, or rivet) that secures movement sensor  1120   1  to mounting platform  1128 . As shown, mounting platforms  1128  are positioned longitudinally between rotor arms  1016  and vertically between wing mount  1012  and connecting arm  1020 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 38 , in some embodiments aerial vehicle  1000  includes a second movement sensor  1120   2  which is positioned so that multicopter linkage  1004  moves between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations independently of the second movement sensor  1120   2 . For example, second movement sensor  1120   2  may be coupled to wing mount  1012 , wing  104 , or tail  236 . In the illustrated example, second movement sensor  1120   2  is connected to wing  104 . Second movement sensor  1120   2  can include one or more of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, for example. In some embodiments, movement sensor  1120   2  is an inertial measurement unit. In some embodiments, movement sensor  1120   2  is a relative pitch or rotation sensor that senses the relative pitch or rotation between wing  104  and components of multicopter linkage  1004  that move between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. Hardware controller  168  is communicatively coupled to the first and second movement sensors  1120   1  (obscured from view) and  1120   2  to receive movement sensor readings. This allows hardware controller  168  to determine the position of multicopter linkage  1004  as between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, and also to determine movement information (e.g. spatial orientation, velocity, and/or acceleration) of aerial vehicle  1000  as a whole. \\n       FIG. 43  shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle  1000  including a configuration actuator  184 . Configuration actuator  184  can be any device operable to move multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. For example, actuator  184  may be rigidly coupled to wing  104  and engaged with a movable portion of multicopter linkage  1004  so that multicopter linkage  1004  (and therefore multicopter rotors  132 ) can be selectively moved between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations by activating actuator  184 . In the illustrated example, actuator  184  is a motor that is rigidly connected to wing mount  1012 .  FIG. 43B  shows another embodiment in which actuator  184  is a motor that is rigidly connected to connecting arm  1020 . In  FIG. 43B , the wing  104  is partially sectioned for clarity of illustration. As shown, actuator  184  is operable to cause rotor arms  1016  to rotate relative to wing mount  1012 . Actuator  184  can act upon rotor arms  1016  by directly or indirectly by way of one or more of gears, belts, and axles for example. \\n     In the example of  FIG. 43 , actuator  184  drives an output gear  1148 , first axle  1040   1  includes an axle gear  1152  meshed with output shaft gear  1148 , and rotor arm first end  1024   1  is rigidly connected to first axle  1040   1 . Actuator  184  can be activated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to rotate output gear  1148 , which rotates first axle  1040   1  (and therefore rotor arms  1016 ) by way of gear  1152 . Thus, actuator  184  can be operated to move multicopter linkage  1004 , and therefore multicopter rotors  132 , between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     In the example of  FIG. 43B , actuator  184  drives an output gear  1148 , second axle  1044   2  includes an axle gear  1152  meshed with output shaft gear  1148 , and rotor arm second end  1028   2  is rigidly connected to second axle  1044   2 . Actuator  184  can be activated (e.g. by control signals from the hardware controller) to rotate output gear  1148 , which rotates second axle  1044   2  (and therefore rotor arms  1016 ) by way of gear  1152 . Thus, actuator  184  can be operated to move multicopter linkage  1004 , and therefore multicopter rotors  132 , between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     In some embodiments, hardware controller  168  operates actuator  184  based at least in part on sensor readings from movement sensor(s)  1120 . For example, sensor  1120   1  (obscured from view, see  FIG. 40 ) or sensors  1120   1  and  1120   2  can provide hardware controller  168  with feedback on the current position of multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, whereby hardware controller  168  can activate actuator  184  until sensor readings from sensor(s)  1120  indicate that the multicopter rotors  132  have moved to the desired position (e.g. as commanded by a user by remote control). As a result, sensor(s)  1120  can allow hardware controller  168  to move multicopter rotors  132  more accurately, which can provide more responsive user control over aerial vehicle  1000 . \\n     Referring to  FIG. 42 , multicopter linkage  1004  can be sold as a discrete component for user&#39;s to assemble with custom or off-the-shelf wing  104 , rotors  132 , and tail  236  to form an aerial vehicle  1000 . This allows hobbyist users to customize aerial vehicle  1000  to their liking, and can also reduce user costs when employing off-the-shelf or homemade components  104 ,  132 , and  236 . \\n     In some embodiments, multicopter linkage  1004  is packaged in a kit  1156  including multicopter linkage  1004 , and one or more (or all) of hardware controller  168 , movement sensor  1120   1 , and configuration actuator  184 . Kit  1156  provides users with the freedom to customized aerial vehicle  1000  with custom or off-the-shelf wing  104 , multicopter rotors  132 , and tail  236 , while saving the user from having to source and configure one or more (or all) of the electronics (e.g. hardware controller  168 , movement sensor(s)  1120 , and/or actuator  184 ) that operate the aerial vehicle  1000 . This can be a boon for users without the skills or access to parts that are required to source and configure these components. \\n     In other embodiments, kit  1156  includes all of the components necessary to build aerial vehicle  1000 . For example, kit  1156  may include multicopter linkage  1004 , hardware controller  168 , movement sensor(s)  1120  (if present), actuator  184  (if present), a plurality of multicopter rotors  132 , and a tail  236 . An unassembled kit  1156  can reduce assembly costs, and these savings can be passed on to the consumer. Unassembled kit  1156  can also provide a useful learning exercise for users new to the hobby, or a pleasurable activity for users that enjoy assembling the aerial vehicle  1000  but want to avoid sourcing and configuring the parts. \\n     Still referring to  FIG. 42 , in some embodiments aerial vehicle  1000  includes one or more configuration locks  1160  for selectively locking the position of multicopter rotors  132  in a fixed-wing or multicopter configuration. In the illustrated example, aerial vehicle  1000  includes a multicopter lock  1160   1  and a fixed wing lock  1160   2 . Each configuration lock  1160  is connectable to multicopter linkage  1004  to inhibit movement of the multicopter linkage  1004  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. Multicopter lock  1160   1  is removably connectable to multicopter linkage  1004  to lock multicopter linkage  1004  in the multicopter configuration, and fixed-wing lock  1160   2  is removably connectable to lock multicopter linkage  1004  in the fixed-wing configuration. This allows aerial vehicle  1000  to be pre-configured in a multicopter or fixed-wing configuration prior to take off so that aerial vehicle  1000  remains in the chosen configuration for the duration of the flight. One or both of configuration locks  1160   1  and  1160   2  can be included in a kit  1156 . \\n     Configuration lock  1160  can be any device operable to selectively lock the position of multicopter rotors  132  in a fixed-wing or multicopter configuration. In the illustrated example, each configuration lock  1160  is formed as a locking bar that attaches to multicopter linkage  1004  at two positions which do not move synchronously (i.e. the distance between the two positions changes) between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. For example, a configuration lock  1160  may be a rigid bar having a first configuration lock end  1164  connectable to first axle  1040   1  and a second configuration lock end  1168  connectable to second axle  1044   3 . Because first axle  1040   1  and second axle  1044   3  move relative to one another when multicopter linkage  1004  moves between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, configuration lock  1160  is able to lock the position of the multicopter linkage  1004  by rigidly connecting the first and second axles  1040   1  and  1044   3 . \\n     The length of each configuration lock  1160  corresponds to the distance between the two positions on the multicopter linkage  1004  in the associated configuration. For example, a multicopter lock will be sized according to the distance between the two positions on multicopter linkage  1004  when in the multicopter position, and the fixed-wing lock will be sized according to the distance between two positions on multicopter linkage  1004  when in the fixed-wing configuration. In the illustrated example, the multicopter lock  1160   1  has a lock length  1172   1  corresponding to the distance  1176   1  ( FIG. 38 ) between first and second axles  1040   1  and  1044   3  when in the multicopter configuration, and fixed-wing lock  1160   2  has a lock length  1172   2  corresponding to the distance  1176   2  ( FIG. 39 ) between first and second axles  1040   1  and  1044   3  in the fixed-wing configuration. \\n     It will be appreciated that different configuration locks can be configured to connect to the same or different positions on multicopter linkage  1004 . For example, the multicopter and fixed-wing locks  1160   1  and  1160   2  can be configured to connect to the same pair of positions on multicopter linkage  1004  as each other, or can be configured to connect to different pairs of positions on multicopter linkage  1004 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 44 and 45 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  1100  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle  1100  includes a body  102  including a wing  104 . A multicopter  108  including rotors  132  is mounted to wing  104  by multicopter linkage  1004 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  132  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by multicopter linkage  1004  between a multicopter configuration ( FIG. 44 ) and a fixed-wing configuration ( FIG. 45 ). \\n     Still referring to  FIGS. 44 and 45 , aerial vehicle  1100  is similar to aerial vehicle  1000  in many respects, except for example the configuration of wing  104 . As shown, wing  104  extends forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter rotors  132 , and includes a plurality of rotor apertures  1204 . Collectively, rotor apertures  1204  are sized and positioned in alignment with multicopter rotors  132  to allow air moved by multicopter rotors  132  when in the multicopter configuration to flow through wing  104  substantially unobstructed. \\n     As shown, rear rotor apertures  1204   2  are also sized and positioned to provide passage for rear multicopter rotors  132   2  to move from the multicopter configuration ( FIG. 44 ) to the fixed wing position ( FIG. 45 ). In the fixed wing configuration, rear multicopter rotors  132   2  extend above wing  104 . A portion of multicopter linkage  1004  may extend through rear rotor apertures  1204   2  to support multicopter rotors  132   2  above wing  104 . \\n     Wing  104  can have any number of rotor apertures  1204 . For example, wing  104  can have one rotor aperture  1204  for each multicopter rotor  132 , as shown. In other embodiments, wing  104  can have fewer rotor apertures  1204  than the number of multicopter rotors  132 . For example, a rotor aperture  1204  may be sized to align with a plurality of multicopter rotors  132  (e.g. one large rotor aperture  1204  may be sized and shaped to align with both front multicopter rotors  132   1 ). \\n     Rotor apertures  1204  can have any shape. In the illustrated example, rotor apertures  1204  are substantially quadrilateral. In other embodiments, rotor apertures  1204  can be circular, triangular, square, or another regular or irregular shape. \\n     Any number of control surfaces  224  may be movably mounted (e.g. pivotably mounted) to wing  104 . The movement of control surfaces  224  may be controlled (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller  168 ) to operate as ailerons for controlling roll, to operate as elevators for controlling pitch, to operate as a rudder to control yaw, or a combination thereof depending on the number, size, position, and orientation of control surfaces  224 . In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle  1100  is shown including three control surfaces  224 . Each control surface  224  may be individually activated (e.g. pivoted upwardly or downwardly) by actuators to create drag for controlling the movement of aerial vehicle  1100 . In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  1100  may have no control surfaces  224 . \\n     Aerial vehicle  1100  may include any number of rotors  192  which produce thrust to create torque for pitching body  102  relative to multicopter  108  or pitching aerial vehicle  1100  as a whole. For example, rotor  192  may be selectively activated to control the pitch of wing  104 . As shown, rotor  192  may be positioned in a rotor aperture  196  which penetrates wing  104 . In the illustrated example, aerial vehicle  1100  includes one rotor aperture  196  and rotor  192  positioned rearward of multicopter rotors  132 . Alternatively, aperture  196  and rotor  192  may be positioned forward of multicopter rotors  132 . In other embodiments, aerial vehicle  1100  may include a plurality of rotors  192  and apertures  196 , which may be arranged in any positional arrangement about wing  104 , as described above in connection with aerial vehicle  100 . In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  1100  may have no rotors  192  and no apertures  196 . \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 46-48 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  1200  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle  1200  includes a body  102  including a wing  104 . The wing  104  is partially sectioned for clarity of illustration. A multicopter  108  including rotors  132  is mounted to wing  104  by multicopter linkage  1004 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  132  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by multicopter linkage  1004  between a multicopter configuration and a fixed-wing configuration. Aerial vehicle  1200  is similar to aerial vehicle  1000  in many respects, except for example the configuration of multicopter linkage  1004  which is not formed as a four-bar linkage. \\n     As shown, multicopter linkage  1004  includes a wing mount  1012 , front and rear axles  1040   1  and  1040   2 , and a transmission  1208 . Multicopter rotors  132  are connected to front and rear axles  1040 , and are thereby rotatable with axles  1040  about lateral axes  1032  relative to body  102  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. Transmission  1208  can be any device that can coordinate the rotation of front and rear axles  1040   1  and  1040   2 , so that front and rear axles  1040   1  and  1040   2  are constrained to rotate simultaneously between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n       FIG. 46  shows an example in which transmission  1208  includes a drive shaft  1212  having a bevel gear  1216  at each end, where the bevel gears  1216  are meshed with the bevel gears  1220  of the front and rear axles  1040 . As a result of the geared connections, the drive shaft  1212  and both axles  1040  are constrained to rotate in unison between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n       FIG. 47  shows another example in which transmission  1208  includes a drive belt  1224  that is wound around the pulleys  1228  of the front and rear axles  1040 . As a result of the pulley connection, the drive belt  1224  constrains the two axles  1040  to rotate in unison between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n       FIG. 48  shows another example in which transmission  1208  includes a drive cable  1228  that is wound at each end around a different one of axles  1040 . As a result of the cable connection, the drive cable  1228  constrains the two axles  1040  to rotate in unison between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     Referring again to  FIGS. 46-48 , multicopter linkage  1004  synchronizes the movement of multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. This may optionally allow aerial vehicle  1200  to be constructed free of actuators or other devices which directly apply torque to rotate multicopter rotors  132  about axles  1040   1  and  1040   2 . Instead, the thrust developed by rotors  132   1  and  132   2  about axles  1040   1  and  1040   2  may be controlled (e.g. by a hardware controller) to cause multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  to move between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, substantially as described with respect to other embodiments. \\n     In some embodiments, aerial vehicle  1200  may include a configuration actuator  184  as shown. Configuration actuator  184  may be operable to move multicopter rotors  132  between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. As shown, configuration actuator  184  may be rigidly coupled to body  102  or wing  104 . For example, configuration actuator may be rigidly connected to wing mount  1012 . \\n       FIG. 46  shows an example in which configuration actuator  184  drives an output gear  1148 , and drive shaft  1212  includes an axle gear  1152  meshed with output shaft gear  1148 , whereby configuration actuator  184  is operable to rotate drive shaft  1212  and therefore axles  1040  and multicopter rotors  132  in unison between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n       FIGS. 47 and 48  show an example in which configuration actuator  184  drives an output gear  1148 , and an axle  1040  includes an axle gear  1152  meshed with output shaft gear  1148 , whereby configuration actuator  184  is operable to rotate the axle  1040 , and therefore the other axle  1040  and multicopter rotors  132  by way of transmission  1208 , between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIG. 49 , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  1300  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle  1300  includes a multicopter  108  rotatably mounted to a body  102  about a multicopter axis  124 . In the example shown, body  102  includes a tail  236 , a nose  1228 , and a multicopter opening  112  positioned between tail  236  and nose  1228 . Multicopter  108  may be rotatably coupled to body  102  in any manner, such as by multicopter axle  148  as shown. \\n     Reference is now made to  FIGS. 50A-50B , where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle  1400  is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle may include a body  102  having body rotors  1404 . A multicopter  108  including rotors  132  is mounted to body  102  by multicopter linkage  1004 . As exemplified, multicopter rotors  132  may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body  102  by multicopter linkage  1004  between a vertical thrust configuration and a horizontal thrust configuration. Aerial vehicle  1400  is similar to aerial vehicle  1000  in many respects, except for example the configuration of body  102  which has body rotors  1404  and no wing. \\n     As shown, multicopter linkage  1004  includes a transmission  1208  and a body mount  1012 . Transmission  1208  may have any configuration suitable to synchronize the rotation of the multicopter rotors  132  between the horizontal thrust configuration ( FIG. 50A ) and the vertical thrust configuration ( FIG. 50B ). For example, transmission  1208  may include a four bar linkage as shown, a drive shaft as illustrated by example in  FIG. 46 , a drive belt as illustrated by example in  FIG. 47 , or a drive cable as illustrated by example in  FIG. 48 . \\n     Body mount  1012  may be any device configured to provide a connection between body  102  and multicopter linkage  1004 . In the illustrated example, body mount  1012  includes front and rear mounting members  1408  which are secured to body  102 . Body  102  may be connected to body mount  1012  in any manner, such as by one or more of fasteners (e.g. screws, bolts, or rivets), adhesives (e.g. glue, cement, or epoxy), welds, strapping (e.g. string, wire, or chain), hooks and loops, or magnets, for example. In some embodiments, body  102  and body mount  1012  are integrally formed. \\n     Body  102  may include a plurality of body rotors  1404  (e.g. 2 to 10 body rotors  1404 ). In the illustrated example, body  102  includes four body rotors  1404 . Body rotors  1404  may have any configuration described above with respect to multicopter rotors  132 , including for example the description of the rotor motor and blades, the number and size(s) of rotors, the positional arrangement of the rotors, and the angularity of the rotors. \\n     Each of body rotors  1404  may have a fixed orientation (thrust direction) relative to body  102 , as shown. In alternative embodiments, body rotors  1404  may be movably connected to body  102 . For example, body rotors  1404  may be rotatably connected to body  102 . \\n       FIG. 50A  shows an example of aerial vehicle  1400  in a vertical thrust configuration. As shown, in the vertical thrust configuration, each of multicopter rotors  132  and body rotors  1404  may be oriented to produce vertical thrust (e.g. thrust in a direction that is within 30 degrees of parallel to a direction of gravity). This may permit multicopter rotors  132  and body rotors  1404  to cooperatively generate lift for vertical take-off and landing, as well as hovering, for example. \\n       FIG. 50B  shows aerial vehicle  1400  in a horizontal thrust configuration. As shown, front multicopter rotor  132   1  has rotated about lateral axis  1032   1  relative to body  102 , and rear multicopter rotor  132   2  has rotated about lateral axis  1032   2  relative to body  102 . The rotation of the front and rear multicopter rotors  132   1  and  132   2  is synchronized by transmission  1208  of multicopter linkage  1004 . Rotors  132  may be freely rotatable between the vertical and horizontal thrust configurations by modulating the thrust of the multicopter rotors  132  and body rotors  1404 . \\n     In the horizontal thrust configuration, multicopter rotors  132  may be oriented to produce horizontal thrust (e.g. thrust in a direction that is within 30 degrees of perpendicular to gravity). Body rotors  1404  may remain oriented to produce vertical thrust. This may permit multicopter rotors  132  to provide forward and/or backward thrust that propels aerial vehicle  1400  forward and/or backward, while body rotors  1404  provide vertical thrust to control the elevation of aerial vehicle  1400 . \\n     Body rotors  1404  may have any orientation in the vertical and horizontal thrust configurations.  FIGS. 50A-50B  show an example in which body rotors  1404  are oriented to produce vertical thrust in the vertical and horizontal thrust configurations.  FIGS. 51A-51B  show a different example in which body rotors  1404  are oriented to produce horizontal thrust in the vertical and horizontal thrust configurations. In other embodiments, body rotors  1404  may be oriented to produce thrust in a direction that is at an angle to vertical and horizontal (e.g. 30-60 degrees from vertical or horizontal), whereby body rotors  1404  may be operable to produce thrust having significant vertical and horizontal components. \\n     The aerial vehicle embodiments disclosed herein (e.g. aerial vehicle  100 ,  300 ,  400 ,  500 ,  600 ,  700 ,  800 ,  900 ,  1000 ,  1100 ,  1200 ,  1300 , and  1400 ) can be scaled to any size. For example, the aerial vehicles can be scaled from small toys, to medium sized personal carriers (e.g. for carrying one or more human passengers), to large sized cargo carriers (e.g. for carrying large shipping containers). \\n     While the above description provides examples of the embodiments, it will be appreciated that some features and/or functions of the described embodiments are susceptible to modification without departing from the spirit and principles of operation of the described embodiments. Accordingly, what has been described above has been intended to be illustrative of the invention and non-limiting and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that other variants and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto.

Aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may be selectively operable in a multicopter configuration and/or a fixed wing configuration. In the multicopter configuration, lift may be provided predominantly by propelling air mass downwardly from the aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In the fixed wing configuration, lift may be provided predominantly by rearward air movement across or onto the wing(s) of the aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. The multicopter configuration (also referred to herein as a vertical thrust configuration) may conveniently permit vertical takeoffs and landings. The fixed wing configuration (also referred to herein as a horizontal thrust configuration) may provide enhanced flight efficiency for greater range between takeoff and landing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> includes a body <b>102</b> configured as a flying wing <b>104</b>. That is, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> is absent a distinct fuselage or tail. As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the cross-section of wing <b>104</b> may be shaped as an aerofoil for developing lift in the fixed wing configuration as described in more detail below. As used herein and in the claims, an aerofoil is any cross-sectional shape suitable for a wing to develop lift in response to forward relative movement of the wing through air. In other embodiments, wing <b>104</b> may be a flat wing that provides lift by its angle of attack.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">Returning to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, wing <b>104</b> may have any top view shape. In the illustrated example, wing <b>104</b> is substantially triangularly shaped. In other embodiments, the top view shape of wing <b>104</b> may be similar to another regular shape (e.g. circular, square, or other polygonal shape), or an irregular shape. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> shows an embodiment <b>500</b> including a rectangular shaped wing <b>104</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref> shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> including a diamond shaped wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">With continuing reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a multicopter <b>108</b> mounted in a multicopter opening (i.e. aperture) <b>112</b> in wing <b>104</b>. Multicopter <b>108</b> may be substantially centered along a longitudinal wing axis <b>116</b>, and/or substantially centered along a lateral wing axis <b>120</b>. Wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b> each extend through the center of mass of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In the illustrated example, multicopter <b>108</b> and multicopter opening <b>112</b> are substantially centered along both wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>. This may improve the mass balance/symmetry of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>, and may enhance the balance/symmetry of thrust developed by multicopter <b>108</b>. In alternative embodiments, multicopter <b>108</b> may be positioned off-centered from both wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> shows an embodiment <b>500</b> including a multicopter <b>108</b> mounted outside of wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">Multicopter opening <b>112</b> may have any shape. In the illustrated example, multicopter opening <b>112</b> is circular. In alternative embodiments, multicopter opening may have another regular shape (e.g. triangular, rectangular, hexagonal, etc.), or an irregular shape. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref> shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> including a multicopter opening <b>112</b> that is rectangular.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, multicopter <b>108</b> may be mounted to wing <b>104</b> with free rotation about a multicopter axis <b>124</b>. This may permit free relative rotation of multicopter <b>108</b> relative to wing <b>104</b> at least within a non-zero angular range of motion. The non-zero angular range of motion may be between 10-360 degrees, such as 10-180 degrees, 10-90 degrees, 10-60 degrees, at least 30 degrees, or 30-90 degrees for example. For example, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rotatable about multicopter axis <b>124</b> relative to wing <b>104</b> substantially without any transmission of torque between multicopter <b>108</b> and wing <b>104</b> (except perhaps insignificant friction at the rotational joint). In some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may be free of devices which transmit torque to rotate multicopter <b>108</b> about multicopter axis <b>124</b> relative to wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">Multicopter axis <b>124</b> may extend in any direction relative to wing <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, multicopter axis <b>124</b> may extend parallel to one of wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>, or multicopter axis <b>124</b> may be coplanar with wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>. For example, multicopter axis <b>124</b> may extend parallel to, or be collinear with, lateral wing axis <b>120</b> as shown. As exemplified in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, this may permit multicopter <b>108</b> to rotate about multicopter axis <b>124</b> to change the direction <b>128</b> of thrust provided by multicopter <b>108</b> to aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 21</figref> shows another embodiment where multicopter axis <b>124</b> is parallel and spaced apart from lateral wing axis <b>120</b>. In the illustrated example, multicopter axis <b>124</b> is positioned below lateral wing axis <b>120</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">Referring again to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, multicopter <b>108</b> may include a plurality of rotors <b>132</b>. Multicopter <b>108</b> including rotors <b>132</b> may be rotatable, relative to wing <b>104</b>, as a unitary assembly about multicopter axis <b>124</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, rotation of multicopter <b>108</b> about multicopter axis <b>124</b> may include rotation of each rotor <b>132</b> about multicopter axis <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be fixedly positioned and oriented relative to each other. For example, multicopter <b>108</b> may be free of actuators for controlling the position or orientation of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> relative to each other. Multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be rigidly connected together in any manner. For example, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be rigidly connected by a frame <b>144</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">Multicopter <b>108</b> may be freely rotatably mounted to body <b>102</b> in any manner. In the illustrated embodiment, multicopter frame <b>144</b> is mounted to an axle <b>148</b>, which itself is mounted to wing <b>104</b>. As shown, multicopter frame <b>144</b> may be rigidly mounted to axle <b>148</b> and axle <b>148</b> may be rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b>. In this example, axle <b>148</b> may be collinear with multicopter axis <b>124</b>. Axle <b>148</b> is shown mounted to wing <b>104</b> at opposite ends of multicopter opening <b>112</b>. Optionally, axle <b>148</b> may be mounted to wing <b>104</b> by axle bearings <b>152</b>. Alternatively or in addition, axle <b>148</b> may be loosely held in axle openings <b>156</b> formed in wing <b>104</b> and wing <b>104</b> may be free of bearings <b>152</b>. In alternative embodiments, multicopter frame <b>144</b> may be rotatably mounted to axle <b>148</b>, and axle <b>148</b> may be rigidly connected to wing <b>104</b>. In a further alternative, multicopter frame <b>144</b> may be rotatably mounted to axle <b>148</b>, and axle <b>148</b> may be rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">Multicopter <b>108</b> may include any number of rotors <b>132</b>. For example, multicopter <b>108</b> may include 2 or more rotors <b>132</b>, or at least <b>4</b> rotors <b>132</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, multicopter <b>108</b> includes four rotors <b>132</b>, and is commonly referred to as a quadcopter. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref> shows another example including a multicopter <b>108</b> with two rotors <b>132</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> may include any number of rotor blades <b>136</b>. Further, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> may include the same number of blades <b>136</b> as each other multicopter rotor <b>132</b>, or one or more (or all) multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may include a different number of rotor blades <b>136</b> than one or more other multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. In some examples, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> may include 1 or more rotor blades <b>136</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, each rotor <b>132</b> includes 2 rotor blades <b>136</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref> shows an example of a multicopter <b>108</b> where each rotor <b>132</b> includes 3 rotor blades <b>136</b>. Each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> may include rotor blades <b>136</b> of the same size, or one or more (or all) multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may include rotor blades <b>136</b> of different sizes than the other multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, all multicopter rotor blades <b>136</b> are the same size.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> is operable to rotate rotor blades <b>136</b> about a respective rotor axis <b>140</b>. Typically, the direction <b>160</b> of thrust for a multicopter rotor <b>132</b> is parallel to its rotor axis <b>140</b>. Rotor axes <b>140</b> of multicopter <b>108</b> may all be parallel as shown. Alternatively, one or more (or all) rotor axes <b>140</b> may extend at an angle to other rotor axes <b>140</b>. In this case, multicopter thrust direction <b>128</b> may be the average of multicopter rotor thrust directions <b>160</b> weighted by thrust magnitude.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">Referring back to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be arranged in any positional arrangement. For example, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be evenly or unevenly distributed in a regular arrangement (e.g. a circular arrangement, a regular polygon arrangement, or a grid arrangement) or an irregular arrangement, which may be centered on multicopter axis <b>124</b> or center-offset from multicopter axis <b>124</b>. In the illustrated example, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> are evenly distributed in a circular arrangement centered on multicopter axis <b>124</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref> shows another example of multicopter <b>108</b> including multicopter rotors <b>132</b> aligned with wing longitudinal axis <b>116</b>. As shown, one multicopter rotor <b>132</b> is forwardly of the multicopter axis <b>124</b>, and one multicopter rotor <b>132</b> is rearward of the multicopter axis <b>124</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> is operable to rotate its respective rotor blades <b>136</b> about its respective rotor axis <b>140</b>. For example, each multicopter rotor <b>132</b> may include a rotor motor <b>164</b> connected to the rotor blades <b>136</b> of that multicopter rotor <b>132</b>, as shown. In some embodiments, the rotary direction of a rotor motor <b>164</b> may be selectively reversible for reversing the thrust direction of the multicopter rotor <b>132</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a hardware controller <b>168</b>. As shown, hardware controller <b>168</b> may include a wireless receiver <b>172</b> for receiving wireless control signals (e.g. from user operable handheld controller), and a processor <b>176</b> for interpreting the control signals from wireless receiver <b>172</b>. Processor <b>176</b> may be connected (e.g. by one or more I/O ports <b>178</b>) to the motors (e.g. rotor motors <b>164</b>), and other actuators of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to operate the aerial vehicle as described herein. For example, processor <b>176</b> may be electrically connected to each multicopter rotor motor <b>164</b> to separately control the torque of each rotor motor <b>164</b>. Hardware controller <b>168</b> may also include one or more sensors <b>180</b> in communication with processor <b>176</b> by wire or wirelessly. For example, a sensor <b>180</b> may be a multi-axis gyroscopic sensor for determining the angular orientation of wing <b>104</b> and multicopter <b>108</b>, a GPS sensor for determining the location coordinates of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>, a barometer, a sonar sensor, or an infrared sensor for determining the altitude of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> above a surface below. In some embodiments, one or more of sensors <b>180</b> may be positioned on wing <b>104</b>, and one or more of sensors <b>180</b> may be positioned on multicopter <b>108</b>. For example, separate accelerometers may be mounted to each of wing <b>104</b> and multicopter <b>108</b> for sensing the orientations of both the wing <b>104</b> and multicopter <b>108</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">Hardware controller <b>168</b> may be mounted to any component of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, hardware controller <b>168</b> is mounted to wing <b>104</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 24</figref> shows another embodiment where hardware controller <b>168</b> is mounted to multicopter <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, some parts of hardware controller <b>168</b> may be separately mounted to different components of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, processor <b>176</b> may be mounted to multicopter <b>108</b>, and wireless receiver <b>172</b> may be mounted to body <b>102</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>)) to rotate their respective rotor blades <b>136</b> at different torques to control the thrust produced, and therefore control the acceleration and velocity of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. Preferably, different multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be selectively operable at different torques to produce different thrust than other multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. This may permit control over the rotation of multicopter <b>108</b> about multicopter axis <b>124</b> by modulating the torques of the different multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. For example, a positive or negative torque about the multicopter axis <b>124</b> may be developed by increasing or decreasing the relative torques of the multicopter rotor(s) <b>132</b> on one side of the multicopter axis <b>124</b> compared to the torques of the multicopter rotor(s) <b>132</b> on the other side of the multicopter axis <b>124</b>. In the illustrated example, multicopter <b>108</b> may be pitched forwardly (i.e. rotate counter-clockwise relative to gravity when viewed from the left) by producing greater thrust with the rear multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <i>b </i>than the front multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <i>a </i>(and vice versa). This may permit aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to transition between the multicopter configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) and the fixed wing configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">In some embodiments, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>)), to reverse the rotary direction, and therefore reverse the rotor thrust direction <b>160</b>. For example, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rapidly pitched forwardly by producing upward thrust with the rear multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <i>b</i>, and downward thrust with the front multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <i>a </i>(and vice versa). This may permit aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to transition quickly between the multicopter configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) and the fixed wing configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> shows aerial vehicle <b>100</b> in a multicopter configuration. The multicopter configuration may provide the convenience of vertical takeoff and landing, and stationary hovering. As shown, in the multicopter configuration, multicopter <b>108</b> may be substantially parallel (e.g. co-planar) with wing <b>104</b> (e.g. parallel with wing axes <b>120</b> and <b>124</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>)). In this orientation, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be upwardly facing with an upward (e.g. in the direction of gravity) multicopter thrust direction <b>128</b>. The magnitude of the multicopter thrust may determine whether aerial vehicle <b>100</b> rises, falls, or hovers at constant elevation. As shown, in the multicopter configuration one or more (or all) multicopter rotors may be at least partially (or completely) positioned inside of multicopter opening <b>112</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25</figref>, in some embodiments, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rotated out of the plane of wing <b>104</b> in the multicopter configuration. For example, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rotated substantially perpendicular to wing <b>104</b> with multicopter rotors <b>132</b> extending above and/or below wing <b>104</b>. This may reduce the drag from wing <b>104</b> during vertical takeoff and landing. Optionally, body <b>102</b> may be shaped to permit aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to be self-supporting on a surface below in the vertical orientation shown. For example, body <b>102</b> may include a vertical stabilizer <b>252</b> which extends transverse (e.g. perpendicular) to wing <b>104</b> to provide additional stability for landing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, in the multicopter configuration, free rotation between multicopter <b>108</b> and wing <b>104</b> may permit wind and/or air resistance to cause wing <b>104</b> to rotate about multicopter axis <b>124</b> (e.g. pitch forwardly or rearwardly in the example shown). In some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a brake <b>182</b> selectively operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to inhibit relative rotation between multicopter <b>108</b> and wing <b>104</b>. Brake <b>182</b> may be activated while multicopter <b>108</b> is in the multicopter configuration, and released to permit multicopter <b>108</b> to rotate relative to wing <b>104</b> to the fixed wing configuration. In some embodiments, brake <b>182</b> may be activated while in the fixed wing configuration. In some embodiments, brake <b>182</b> may be activated to lesser degrees to slow the rotation of wing <b>104</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, as an alternative to brake <b>182</b>, or in addition to brake <b>182</b>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include an actuator <b>184</b> (e.g. motor) operable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to control the rotary orientation of wing <b>104</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b>. Actuator <b>184</b> may be operated while multicopter <b>108</b> is in the multicopter configuration, or the fixed wing configuration, or both, and released when transitioning between the two modes to permit free rotation of multicopter <b>108</b> relative to wing <b>104</b>. In use, actuator <b>184</b> may be operable to make fine adjustments to the angle between multicopter <b>108</b> and wing <b>104</b> in support of steering aerial vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, as an alternative to brake <b>182</b> and actuator <b>184</b>, or in addition to one or both of brake <b>182</b> and actuator <b>184</b>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a wing stabilization system <b>188</b>. Wing stabilization system <b>188</b> may include one or more rotors <b>192</b> which produce thrust to create torque for reorienting body <b>102</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b>. For example, stabilization rotor(s) <b>192</b> may be selectively activated to control the pitch or roll of wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">Wing stabilization system <b>188</b> may include any number of stabilization rotors <b>192</b>. For example, wing stabilization system <b>188</b> may include one or more stabilization rotors <b>192</b>. In the illustrated example, wing stabilization system <b>188</b> includes two stabilization rotors <b>192</b>, which may be selectively activated to develop thrust for providing torque for pitch control. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> including a wing stabilization system <b>188</b> with three stabilization rotors <b>192</b> for pitch and roll control. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 20 and 24</figref> show embodiments of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> including a wing stabilization system <b>188</b> with four stabilization rotors <b>192</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may be positioned in a stabilization rotor aperture <b>196</b> which penetrates wing <b>104</b>. Stabilization rotors <b>192</b> and apertures <b>196</b> may be arranged in any positional arrangement about wing <b>104</b>. For example, stabilization rotors <b>192</b> and apertures <b>196</b> may be evenly or unevenly distributed about wing <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, stabilization rotors <b>192</b> and apertures <b>196</b> may be positioned on opposite sides of one or both of wing axes <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>. This may permit stabilization rotors <b>192</b> to provide thrust about opposite sides of the wing axis <b>116</b> or <b>120</b> for rotating wing <b>104</b> about that axis <b>116</b> or <b>120</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">In the illustrated embodiment, wing stabilization system <b>188</b> includes a front stabilization rotor <b>192</b> <i>a </i>in a front stabilization rotor aperture <b>196</b> <i>a</i>, and a rear stabilization rotor <b>192</b> <i>b </i>in a rear stabilization rotor aperture <b>196</b>b. Rotors <b>192</b> <i>a </i>and <b>192</b> <i>b </i>may be selectively activated independently of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> for adjusting the pitch of wing <b>104</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows another embodiment including a front stabilization rotor <b>192</b> <i>a</i>, a rear left stabilization rotor <b>192</b> <i>b</i>L, and a rear right stabilization rotor <b>192</b> <i>b</i>R. As shown, rear stabilization rotors <b>192</b> <i>b</i>L and <b>192</b> <i>b</i>R may be positioned on opposite sides of longitudinal wing axis <b>116</b> to control the roll of wing <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, rear stabilization rotors <b>192</b> <i>b</i>L and <b>192</b> <i>b</i>R may be selectively activated to control the roll of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> as a whole (i.e. including wing <b>104</b> and multicopter <b>108</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may be oriented to provide thrust in any direction <b>200</b>. For example, all stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may have an upward thrust direction <b>200</b>, all stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may have a downward thrust direction <b>200</b>, or some stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may have an upward thrust direction <b>200</b> while other stabilization rotors <b>192</b> have a downward thrust direction <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, one or more (or all) stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may be operable to selectively change their thrust directions <b>200</b>. For example, a stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may be operable to reverse the rotation of its rotor blades <b>204</b> to invert its thrust direction <b>200</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">Alternatively, or in addition, a stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may be rotatable to selectively face a different direction. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment where each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> is rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b> by a stabilization rotor axle <b>208</b>. A motor <b>212</b> may be connected to each axle <b>208</b>. Motor <b>212</b> may be selectively operated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to rotate the connected stabilization rotor <b>192</b> to face a selected direction.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">Returning to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may be rigidly connected to wing <b>104</b>. As shown, each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may have an upward thrust direction <b>200</b> that may or may not be reversible. In this example, wing <b>104</b> may be pitched forwardly or rearwardly by modulating the relative thrusts of front and rear stabilization rotors <b>192</b> <i>a </i>and <b>192</b> <i>b</i>. Stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may also be activated to provide lift during either or both of the multicopter configuration and the fixed wing configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">Similar to multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> is operable to rotate its respective stabilization rotor blades <b>204</b> about its respective stabilization rotor axis <b>216</b>. For example, each stabilization rotor <b>192</b> may include a stabilization rotor motor <b>216</b> connected to the rotor blades <b>204</b> of that stabilization rotor <b>192</b>, as shown.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, which shows aerial vehicle <b>100</b> in a fixed wing configuration. In this configuration, multicopter <b>108</b> may be independently rotated out of the plane of wing <b>104</b> to provide horizontal (e.g. forward) thrust. As shown, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rotated at an angle <b>220</b> to wing <b>104</b>. One or more (or all) multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be at least partially (or completely) positioned outside of multicopter opening <b>112</b> in the fixed wing configuration (e.g. above or below wing <b>104</b>). This may permit those multicopter rotors <b>132</b> to provide effective thrust for propelling wing <b>104</b> horizontally (e.g. forward along longitudinal axis <b>116</b>). The shape of wing <b>104</b> (e.g. aerofoil shape) and/or the angle of attack of wing <b>104</b> may passively create lift for aerial vehicle <b>100</b> in response to forward movement of wing <b>104</b> through air. Optionally, stabilization rotors <b>192</b> (if present) may be activated to provide supplemental lift.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, multicopter <b>108</b> may be rotated to any angle <b>220</b> in the fixed wing configuration. For example, multicopter angle <b>220</b> may be greater than 10 degrees, such as 10-90 degrees. In the illustrated embodiment, angle <b>220</b> is approximately 45 degrees. At some multicopter angles <b>220</b> (e.g. less than 90 degrees), multicopter thrust direction <b>128</b> may deviate from horizontal (i.e. be non-horizontal) so that multicopter thrust direction <b>128</b> may have both upward and forward components to provide both lift and forward thrust. At some other multicopter angles <b>220</b> (e.g. 90 degrees), multicopter thrust direction <b>128</b> may be substantially horizontal so that multicopter <b>108</b> may contribute forward thrust with little or no lift.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">Referring back to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include one or more devices for stabilizing the orientation of wing <b>104</b>. For example, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include one or more of a brake <b>182</b>, actuator <b>184</b>, and wing stabilization system <b>188</b>, as described above. Alternative, or in addition to any one or more of these devices, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include one or more control surfaces <b>224</b>. Control surfaces <b>224</b> may be movably mounted (e.g. pivotably mounted) to wing <b>104</b>. The movement of control surfaces <b>224</b> may be controlled (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to operate as ailerons for controlling roll, to operate as elevators for controlling pitch, to operate as a rudder to control yaw, or a combination thereof depending on the number, size, position, and orientation of control surfaces <b>224</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> is shown including two control surfaces <b>224</b> symmetrically disposed on opposite sides of wing longitudinal axis <b>116</b>, on a rear end <b>228</b> of wing <b>104</b>. Each control surface <b>224</b> may be individually activated (e.g. pivoted upwardly or downwardly) by actuators (e.g. motors <b>232</b>) to create drag for controlling roll and steering of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>, in some embodiments, body <b>102</b> may include a tail <b>236</b> which extends rearwardly from wing <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, tail <b>236</b> is a passive tail without control surfaces. Tail <b>236</b> may be rigidly connected to wing <b>104</b> to provide drag which may help to orient aerial vehicle <b>100</b> so that aerial vehicle <b>100</b> tends to travel in a forward direction <b>240</b> in the fixed wing configuration. Tail <b>236</b> may be made of any material, which may be flexible or rigid. In some embodiments, tail <b>236</b> may be made of a flexible material, such as a sheet of flexible plastic.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, in some embodiments, tail <b>236</b> may be an active tail including one or more control surfaces <b>224</b>. As shown, tail <b>236</b> may include a vertical stabilizer <b>252</b> including a vertical control surface <b>224</b>, which may act as a rudder for influencing yaw. Tail <b>236</b> may be rigidly connected to wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>300</b> in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As exemplified, aerial vehicle <b>300</b> may include a body <b>102</b> having a frame <b>304</b>, wings <b>308</b>, and a tail <b>312</b>. A multicopter <b>108</b> is positioned in a multicopter opening <b>112</b> of frame <b>304</b>. Further, multicopter <b>108</b> is freely rotatably mounted to frame <b>304</b> similarly to how multicopter <b>108</b> is freely rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b> in aerial vehicle <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>). This may permit multicopter <b>108</b> to rotate about multicopter axis <b>124</b> independently of the frame <b>304</b>, wings <b>308</b>, and tail <b>312</b> for transitioning between the multicopter configuration and the fixed wing configuration, as described above with respect to aerial vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, each wing <b>308</b> may extend laterally outwardly from vehicle frame <b>304</b>. Wings <b>308</b> may have a cross-sectional shape suitable for producing lift in response to forward movement through air. For example, each wing <b>308</b> may be shaped as an aerofoil. This may permit wings <b>308</b> to contribute lift to aerial vehicle <b>300</b> when operating in the fixed wing configuration where multicopter <b>108</b> may be oriented forwardly to provide forward thrust.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">As exemplified, tail <b>312</b> may extend rearwardly from vehicle frame <b>304</b>. Tail <b>312</b> may be directly connected in contact with vehicle frame <b>304</b> or rearwardly spaced apart from vehicle frame <b>304</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, tail <b>312</b> is shown rearwardly spaced apart from vehicle frame <b>304</b> by a tail bracket <b>316</b>. Tail <b>312</b> may be a passive tail without control surfaces (e.g. similar to tail <b>236</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>), or tail may be an active tail with one or more control surfaces (e.g. similar to tail <b>236</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, tail <b>312</b> is an active tail formed as a control surface <b>224</b>. Control surface <b>224</b> may be selectively rotatable (e.g. pivotable) upwardly and downwardly by activating control surface motor <b>232</b> (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>). This may permit control surface <b>224</b> to create drag to operate as an elevator for influencing the pitch of aerial vehicle <b>300</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 9</figref>, frame <b>304</b> may have any shape. In the illustrated example, frame <b>304</b> is substantially square in top plan view.

As shown, aerial vehicle <b>600</b> may include a body <b>102</b>, including a frame <b>304</b> and wings <b>308</b>. In the illustrated example, wings <b>308</b> extend laterally outwardly of frame <b>304</b> along lateral wing axis <b>120</b>. Frame <b>304</b> is shown extending downwardly, transverse to wings <b>120</b>. Multicopter <b>108</b> is rotatably mounted (e.g. freely rotatably mounted) to frame <b>304</b> similarly to how multicopter <b>108</b> is rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b> in aerial vehicle <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>).

As shown, counterweight <b>602</b> may be permanently or removably mounted to the bottom of frame <b>304</b>. Counterweight <b>602</b> may help to maintain aerial vehicle <b>600</b> oriented so that frame <b>304</b> (and multicopter <b>108</b>) extends below wings <b>308</b>.

For example, wings <b>308</b> may be rotated upwardly as shown or downwardly, in the multicopter configuration or for compact storage. In the multicopter configuration, turning wings <b>308</b> upwardly or downwardly may reduce the resistance from wings <b>308</b> during vertical takeoff and landing, and may permit aerial vehicle <b>300</b> to land in a smaller area.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\">Wings <b>308</b> may be upwardly or downwardly rotatable relative to multicopter <b>108</b> by any wing angle <b>320</b>. For example, wing angle <b>320</b> may be less than 30 degrees, such as 0 degrees, in the fixed wing configuration, and wing angle <b>320</b> may be at least 30 degrees, such as 90 degrees in the multicopter configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\">Wings <b>308</b> may be upwardly or downwardly rotatable relative to multicopter <b>108</b> in any manner.

Wing motors <b>324</b> may be selectively activated (e.g. by control signals from controller <b>168</b>) to rotate wings <b>308</b> to the desired wing angle <b>320</b>. In an alternative embodiment, upward or downward rotation of wings <b>308</b> may be exclusively manually operated (e.g. free of electronic actuators) or additionally manually operated for the purpose of making aerial vehicle <b>300</b> more compact for storage.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 15</figref> where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>500</b> in accordance with another embodiment is shown.

Body <b>102</b> is shown positioned between rotors <b>136</b> of multicopter <b>108</b>. As exemplified, multicopter rotors <b>136</b> may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body <b>102</b> by a multicopter axle <b>148</b> which extends laterally across and outboard of wing <b>104</b>.

That is, all multicopter rotors <b>136</b> of multicopter <b>108</b> are collectively rotatable about multicopter axis <b>124</b> relative to body <b>102</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 10</figref> where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>400</b> in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle <b>400</b> may be shaped as a traditional airplane including a body <b>102</b> having a fuselage <b>404</b>, wings <b>308</b>, and a tail <b>236</b>. Multicopter <b>108</b> may be positioned in multicopter opening <b>112</b> formed in fuselage <b>404</b>, and freely rotatably mounted to fuselage <b>404</b> analogously to the description above with respect to the mounting of multicopter <b>108</b> in aerial vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\">As shown, tail <b>236</b> may include a tailplane <b>244</b> including left and right horizontal stabilizers <b>248</b>, and a vertical stabilizer <b>252</b>. One or more (or all) of stabilizers <b>248</b> and <b>252</b> may include a control surface <b>224</b>. In the illustrated example, each horizontal stabilizer <b>248</b> includes a horizontal control surface <b>224</b>, which may act as elevators for influencing pitch, and vertical stabilizer <b>252</b> includes a vertical control surface <b>224</b>, which may act as a rudder for influencing yaw. Tail <b>236</b> may be formed of any material, which may be rigid for example.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\">Fuselage <b>404</b> may provide storage capacity for transporting cargo and/or passengers as in a traditional airplane. Multicopter <b>108</b> may provide lift for vertical takeoff and landing in the multicopter configuration. Wings <b>308</b> may be appropriately shaped (e.g. as aerofoils) to provide lift in the fixed wing configuration where multicopter <b>108</b> is angled forwardly to provide forward thrust. One or both of wings <b>308</b> and tail <b>236</b> may include one or more control surfaces <b>224</b>, which may act as ailerons, elevators, rudders, or combinations thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 11</figref>. As an alternative to or in addition to positioning a multicopter <b>108</b> in a multicopter opening <b>112</b> formed in fuselage <b>404</b>, aerial vehicle <b>400</b> may include one or more multicopters <b>108</b> <i>b </i>positioned in multicopter openings <b>112</b> in wings <b>308</b>. Each multicopter <b>108</b> <i>b </i>may be freely hingedly mounted to a respective wing <b>308</b> analogously to the description above with respect to the mounting of multicopter <b>108</b> in aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In one aspect, multicopters <b>108</b> <i>b </i>may provide enhanced control over the roll of aerial vehicle <b>400</b>. For example, multicopters <b>108</b> <i>b </i>may be controlled to produce different magnitudes of thrust to influence the roll of aerial vehicle <b>400</b>. In another aspect, multicopters <b>108</b> <i>b </i>may substitute a multicopter positioned in fuselage <b>404</b> as shown, which may permit fuselage <b>404</b> to carry more cargo and/or passengers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0119\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 20</figref>, which shows another embodiment of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> includes a multicopter <b>108</b> rotatably mounted (e.g. freely rotatably mounted) in a multicopter opening <b>112</b>. As shown, body <b>102</b> is free of control surfaces. Instead, stabilization system <b>188</b> may include four stabilization rotors <b>192</b>. In some embodiments, stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may be operated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) in the fixed-wing configuration for steering (e.g. to pitch and roll wing <b>104</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0120\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>. In some embodiments aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may be configured to carry one or more articles of cargo <b>256</b> (referred to herein as packages). For example, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include one or more releasable cargo mounts <b>260</b> for holding packages <b>256</b> (e.g. suspended below wing <b>104</b>). Cargo mounts <b>260</b> may include any retention members (e.g. straps, arms, brackets, etc.), and may be manually releasable (e.g. by hand), and/or electronically releasable (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>). This may permit aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to operate as a delivery drone for delivering packages (e.g. to fulfill internet orders).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0121\">Aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include any number of cargo mounts <b>260</b>. For example, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include 1 or more cargo mounts. In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> includes <b>8</b> cargo mounts.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0122\">Cargo mounts <b>260</b> may have any size. For example, all cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be configured for holding similarly sized packages <b>256</b> as shown, or at least one cargo mount <b>260</b> may be configured for holding a differently sized (e.g. larger or smaller) package <b>256</b>. In some cases, cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be adjustable for holding a variety of package sizes, and/or combinable for holding larger sized packages <b>256</b> (e.g. double, triple, or quadruple sized packages <b>256</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0123\">Cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be positionally arranged in any manner about aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be arranged to hold packages aligned in rows, columns, or arbitrary positions about aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, cargo mounts <b>260</b> are positioned to hold packages <b>256</b> in a single file row proximate each of the left and right sides <b>264</b> and <b>268</b> of wing <b>104</b>. Cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be connected to any portion of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, cargo mounts <b>260</b> may be connected to the body <b>102</b> of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>, such as to wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0124\">It will be appreciated that packages <b>256</b> may act to laterally and/or longitudinally offset the center of gravity of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, packages <b>256</b> may be asymmetrically arranged about wing <b>104</b>, or packages <b>256</b> may be asymmetrically weighted about wing <b>104</b>. The asymmetry of packages <b>256</b> may be further aggravated upon releasing (e.g. delivering) a subset of packages <b>256</b> being carried by aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. Unless compensated for, an offset center of gravity may cause aerial vehicle <b>100</b> to unwantedly pitch, roll, or yaw.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0125\">In some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a mass balancing system <b>272</b> mounted to the body <b>102</b> of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> (e.g. connected to wing <b>104</b>). Mass balancing system <b>272</b> may include one or more masses <b>276</b> (e.g. relatively heavy solid object or liquid volume) which is selectively movable to help restore the center of gravity of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, masses <b>276</b> may be a functional component such as an energy source (e.g. battery or fuel). Each mass <b>276</b> may be movable in any direction. For example, mass <b>276</b> may be laterally movable as shown, longitudinally movable (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>), or both. In a simple example, if a package <b>256</b> is released from the left side of aerial vehicle <b>100</b>, then mass <b>276</b> may be moved leftwardly to compensate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0126\">Mass <b>276</b> may be movable in any manner. For example, mass <b>276</b> may be movable manually (e.g. by hand), or electronically (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, mass <b>276</b> is a solid object mounted to slide along a rail <b>280</b>. In this example, a motor <b>284</b> (which may constitute mass <b>276</b> or contribute to the weight of mass <b>276</b>) may be connected to mass <b>276</b> for moving mass <b>276</b> along rail <b>280</b>. For example, motor <b>284</b> may be mounted to mass <b>276</b> and drive a sprocket or wheel (not shown) which engages rail <b>280</b> to move mass <b>276</b> along rail <b>280</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0127\">It will be appreciated that as an alternative to, or in addition to mass balancing system <b>272</b>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may include a wing stabilization system <b>188</b> and/or control surfaces <b>224</b> to help counteract pitch, yaw, or roll caused by mass imbalances. For example, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref> shows an example including a mass balancing system <b>272</b> with a laterally movable mass <b>276</b> which may compensate for lateral mass imbalance that might cause roll, and a pitch stabilization system <b>188</b> which may be operable to compensate for longitudinal mass imbalance that might cause pitch. Similarly, <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show examples including a mass balancing system <b>272</b>, with one or more longitudinally movable masses <b>276</b>, which may compensate for longitudinal mass imbalance that might cause pitch, and a pitch stabilization system <b>188</b> which may be operable to compensate for lateral mass imbalance that might cause roll. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 13</figref>, mass <b>276</b> is longitudinally movable along a range of motion defined by rail <b>280</b> which is centered laterally and positioned forwardly of multicopter <b>108</b>. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>, two masses <b>276</b> are longitudinally movable along separate paths defined by separate rails <b>280</b> which are laterally outboard of opposite sides of multicopter <b>108</b>, and which extend forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter <b>108</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0128\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 23</figref>, where like part numbers refer to like parts in the other figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>700</b> is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, body <b>102</b> may include frame <b>304</b>, wings <b>308</b>, and cargo holds <b>702</b>. Cargo holds <b>702</b> may provide storage for packages <b>256</b>. Packages <b>256</b> can be manually stored in cargo holds <b>702</b>. Optionally, packages <b>256</b> may be selectively jettisoned (e.g. by control signals) from cargo holds <b>702</b> (e.g. to complete a package delivery).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0129\">Cargo holds <b>702</b> may be positioned anywhere on aerial vehicle <b>700</b>. In the illustrated example, cargo holds <b>702</b> are positioned forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter <b>108</b>. This may help to distribute the weight of packages <b>256</b> on aerial vehicle <b>700</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0130\">It will be appreciated that in any of the embodiments disclosed herein, the body <b>102</b> of the aerial vehicle (<b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, or <b>700</b>) may be provided as a subassembly (e.g. retrofit kit) for attachment with a compatible (e.g. appropriately sized) multicopter <b>108</b>. This allows an existing multicopter <b>108</b> to be enhanced with a fixed wing configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0132\" num=\"0131\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref> shows an example of body <b>102</b> of aerial vehicle <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, which is suitable for attachment to an existing multicopter. Body <b>102</b> may be connected to a multicopter in any manner that allows the multicopter to rotate about the multicopter axis <b>124</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, wing <b>104</b> of body <b>102</b> includes an axle <b>148</b> which extends across multicopter opening <b>112</b> and which is rotatably mounted to wing <b>104</b> by axle bearings <b>156</b>. As shown, a multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> may be secured to axle <b>148</b> in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, straps, or by integrally forming multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> and axle <b>148</b>. A multicopter may be rigidly fastened to multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, or straps. In some embodiments, multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> may accommodate a releasable connection to a multicopter so that the multicopter can be selectively disconnected from body <b>102</b> as desired.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0132\">In alternative embodiments, axle <b>148</b> may be rigidly connected to wing <b>104</b> in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, or by integrally forming axle <b>148</b> and wing <b>104</b>. In this case, multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> may be rotatably mounted to axle <b>148</b> in any manner suitable for allowing the multicopter connected to mounting bracket <b>288</b> to rotate about multicopter axis <b>124</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0133\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 19</figref> shows another example of a body <b>102</b> suitable for attachment to an existing multicopter. As shown, body <b>102</b> may include stabilization system <b>188</b>, wings <b>308</b> with control surfaces <b>224</b> <i>c</i>, and tail <b>312</b> with control surface <b>224</b> <i>a</i>. As with the embodiment of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>, body <b>102</b> may be connected to a multicopter in any manner that allows the multicopter to rotate about the multicopter axis <b>124</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, frame <b>304</b> of body <b>102</b> includes an axle <b>148</b> which extends across multicopter opening <b>112</b> and which is rotatably mounted to frame <b>304</b> by axle bearings <b>156</b>. As shown, a multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> may be secured to axle <b>148</b> in any manner, such as by screws, bolts, welds, magnets, straps, or by integrally forming multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> and axle <b>148</b>. As described with respect to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 16</figref>, a multicopter may be rigidly fastened to multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> in any manner, multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> may accommodate a releasable connection to a multicopter, and axle <b>148</b> may alternatively be rigidly connected to frame <b>304</b> and multicopter mounting bracket <b>288</b> rotatably mounted to axle <b>148</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0134\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 17</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>300</b> may provide simplified movement control. For example, in some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>3</b> may have seven degrees of freedom and effectively seven actuators, which may be mapped to a square 7\u00d77 matrix. As a square matrix, it is invertible and single-solution. This may reduce the computational demand on hardware controller <b>168</b>. For example, when a user directs hardware controller <b>168</b> (e.g. by remote control) to produce a specific movement in one or more of the seven degrees of freedom, the hardware controller <b>168</b> may resolve a single solution (e.g. a single set of instructions for the seven actuators). In contrast, where there are more actuators than degrees of freedom (e.g. an 8\u00d77 matrix), there will be several solutions for each movement scenario, which may require hardware controller <b>168</b> to assess and select the best solution. This may be more computationally intensive. Still, in some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>300</b> has more actuators than degrees of freedom.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0135\">The seven degrees of freedom include movement along three axes (e.g. x, y, z) and rotation about the three axes (e.g. roll, yaw, and pitch), as well as rotation of the body <b>102</b> about multicopter axis <b>124</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the seven actuators may include the four multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, the two control surfaces <b>224</b> <i>c </i>of wings <b>308</b>, and the control surface <b>224</b> <i>a </i>of tail <b>312</b>. The rotational connection between multicopter <b>108</b> and wing <b>104</b> may be unactuated (i.e. free of torque producing devices).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0136\">In some embodiments, a group of two or more actuators may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator. As used herein, and in the claims, a group of actuators are said to operate \u201csynchronously\u201d where those actuators are operated according to a predefined fixed relationship. For example, hardware controller <b>168</b> may be configured to control two synchronously operated actuators according to a predefined relationship which may be to actuate the two actuators identically, oppositely, or according to one or more mathematical correlations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0137\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b>, and the two control surfaces <b>224</b>. In this example, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, or the two control surfaces <b>224</b> may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0138\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>100</b> may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b>, the two control surfaces <b>224</b> <i>a</i>, and the control surface <b>224</b> <i>b</i>. In this example, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, and the two control surfaces <b>224</b> may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0139\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 18</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>300</b> may be characterized as having effectively seven actuators including the four multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b>, the one control surface <b>224</b> <i>a</i>, and the two control surfaces <b>224</b> <i>c</i>. In this example, the two stabilization rotors <b>192</b> may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator, and the two control surfaces <b>224</b> <i>c </i>may operate synchronously as effectively one actuator.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0140\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26</figref>, where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>800</b> in accordance with another embodiment is shown. As shown, aerial vehicle <b>800</b> may include a body <b>102</b> including a wing <b>104</b>, which is positioned between rotors <b>132</b> of multicopter <b>108</b>. As exemplified, multicopter rotors <b>136</b> may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body <b>102</b> by a multicopter linkage <b>802</b> which extends forwardly and rearwardly of wing <b>104</b>. This allows body <b>102</b> to be free of multicopter openings <b>112</b> (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>), which may enhance the aerodynamics of body <b>102</b>, and make multicopter <b>108</b> more easily retrofitted to existing aerial vehicles.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0141\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 26</figref>, multicopter <b>108</b> may include one or more first multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1</sub>, and one or more second multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>connected to wing <b>104</b> by a multicopter linkage <b>802</b>.

Multicopter linkage <b>802</b> allows the first multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>to rotate about a first axis <b>806</b>, and allows the second multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>about a second axis <b>810</b>, for moving between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0142\">Multicopter <b>108</b> may include any number of first and second multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2</sub>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 27</figref> shows an example of multicopter <b>108</b> including one first multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>1</sub>, and one second multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>2</sub>.

Multicopter linkage <b>802</b> may be any mechanical linkage that connects the first and second multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>to wing <b>104</b> and allows the first and second multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>to rotate about spaced apart first and second axes <b>806</b> and <b>810</b>, respectively.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0144\">Multicopter linkage <b>802</b> synchronizes the movement of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations.

Instead, the thrust developed by multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>may be controlled (e.g. by hardware controller <b>168</b>) to cause multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>to move between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, substantially as described with respect to other embodiments. In other embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>800</b> may include one or more actuators or brakes (not shown) for moving or restricting the movement of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0145\">In some embodiments, multicopter linkage <b>802</b> operates as a four-bar linkage. As shown, multicopter linkage <b>802</b> may include a first rotor arm <b>814</b> connected to multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>1</sub>, a second rotor arm <b>818</b> connected to multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>2</sub>, and a connecting arm <b>822</b>.

For example, clockwise rotation of first multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>1 </sub>about first axis <b>806</b> relative to wing <b>104</b> moves connecting arm <b>822</b> which causes second multicopter rotor <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>to rotate clockwise about second axis <b>810</b> relative to wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0146\">Rotor arms <b>814</b> and <b>818</b> may be rotatably connected to wing <b>104</b> in any manner that allows rotor arms <b>814</b> and <b>818</b> to rotate about first and second axes <b>806</b> and <b>810</b>, respectively.

For example, actuator <b>184</b> may be rigidly coupled to wing <b>104</b> and engaged with a movable portion of multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> so that multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> (and therefore multicopter rotors <b>132</b>) can be selectively moved between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations by activating actuator <b>184</b>. In the illustrated example, actuator <b>184</b> is a motor that is rigidly connected to wing mount <b>1012</b>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 43B</figref> shows another embodiment in which actuator <b>184</b> is a motor that is rigidly connected to connecting arm <b>1020</b>. In <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 43B</figref>, the wing <b>104</b> is partially sectioned for clarity of illustration. As shown, actuator <b>184</b> is operable to cause rotor arms <b>1016</b> to rotate relative to wing mount <b>1012</b>. Actuator <b>184</b> can act upon rotor arms <b>1016</b> by directly or indirectly by way of one or more of gears, belts, and axles for example.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0172\">In the example of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 43</figref>, actuator <b>184</b> drives an output gear <b>1148</b>, first axle <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>includes an axle gear <b>1152</b> meshed with output shaft gear <b>1148</b>, and rotor arm first end <b>1024</b> <sub>1 </sub>is rigidly connected to first axle <b>1040</b> <sub>1</sub>. Actuator <b>184</b> can be activated (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to rotate output gear <b>1148</b>, which rotates first axle <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>(and therefore rotor arms <b>1016</b>) by way of gear <b>1152</b>. Thus, actuator <b>184</b> can be operated to move multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>, and therefore multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0173\">In the example of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 43B</figref>, actuator <b>184</b> drives an output gear <b>1148</b>, second axle <b>1044</b> <sub>2 </sub>includes an axle gear <b>1152</b> meshed with output shaft gear <b>1148</b>, and rotor arm second end <b>1028</b> <sub>2 </sub>is rigidly connected to second axle <b>1044</b> <sub>2</sub>. Actuator <b>184</b> can be activated (e.g. by control signals from the hardware controller) to rotate output gear <b>1148</b>, which rotates second axle <b>1044</b> <sub>2 </sub>(and therefore rotor arms <b>1016</b>) by way of gear <b>1152</b>. Thus, actuator <b>184</b> can be operated to move multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>, and therefore multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0174\">In some embodiments, hardware controller <b>168</b> operates actuator <b>184</b> based at least in part on sensor readings from movement sensor(s) <b>1120</b>. For example, sensor <b>1120</b> <sub>1 </sub>(obscured from view, see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 40</figref>) or sensors <b>1120</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1120</b> <sub>2 </sub>can provide hardware controller <b>168</b> with feedback on the current position of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, whereby hardware controller <b>168</b> can activate actuator <b>184</b> until sensor readings from sensor(s) <b>1120</b> indicate that the multicopter rotors <b>132</b> have moved to the desired position (e.g. as commanded by a user by remote control). As a result, sensor(s) <b>1120</b> can allow hardware controller <b>168</b> to move multicopter rotors <b>132</b> more accurately, which can provide more responsive user control over aerial vehicle <b>1000</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0175\">Referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 42</figref>, multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> can be sold as a discrete component for user&#39;s to assemble with custom or off-the-shelf wing <b>104</b>, rotors <b>132</b>, and tail <b>236</b> to form an aerial vehicle <b>1000</b>. This allows hobbyist users to customize aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> to their liking, and can also reduce user costs when employing off-the-shelf or homemade components <b>104</b>, <b>132</b>, and <b>236</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0176\">In some embodiments, multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> is packaged in a kit <b>1156</b> including multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>, and one or more (or all) of hardware controller <b>168</b>, movement sensor <b>1120</b> <sub>1</sub>, and configuration actuator <b>184</b>. Kit <b>1156</b> provides users with the freedom to customized aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> with custom or off-the-shelf wing <b>104</b>, multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, and tail <b>236</b>, while saving the user from having to source and configure one or more (or all) of the electronics (e.g. hardware controller <b>168</b>, movement sensor(s) <b>1120</b>, and/or actuator <b>184</b>) that operate the aerial vehicle <b>1000</b>. This can be a boon for users without the skills or access to parts that are required to source and configure these components.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0177\">In other embodiments, kit <b>1156</b> includes all of the components necessary to build aerial vehicle <b>1000</b>. For example, kit <b>1156</b> may include multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>, hardware controller <b>168</b>, movement sensor(s) <b>1120</b> (if present), actuator <b>184</b> (if present), a plurality of multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, and a tail <b>236</b>. An unassembled kit <b>1156</b> can reduce assembly costs, and these savings can be passed on to the consumer. Unassembled kit <b>1156</b> can also provide a useful learning exercise for users new to the hobby, or a pleasurable activity for users that enjoy assembling the aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> but want to avoid sourcing and configuring the parts.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0178\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 42</figref>, in some embodiments aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> includes one or more configuration locks <b>1160</b> for selectively locking the position of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> in a fixed-wing or multicopter configuration. In the illustrated example, aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> includes a multicopter lock <b>1160</b> <sub>1 </sub>and a fixed wing lock <b>1160</b> <sub>2</sub>. Each configuration lock <b>1160</b> is connectable to multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> to inhibit movement of the multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. Multicopter lock <b>1160</b> <sub>1 </sub>is removably connectable to multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> to lock multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> in the multicopter configuration, and fixed-wing lock <b>1160</b> <sub>2 </sub>is removably connectable to lock multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> in the fixed-wing configuration. This allows aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> to be pre-configured in a multicopter or fixed-wing configuration prior to take off so that aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> remains in the chosen configuration for the duration of the flight. One or both of configuration locks <b>1160</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1160</b> <sub>2 </sub>can be included in a kit <b>1156</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0179\">Configuration lock <b>1160</b> can be any device operable to selectively lock the position of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> in a fixed-wing or multicopter configuration. In the illustrated example, each configuration lock <b>1160</b> is formed as a locking bar that attaches to multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> at two positions which do not move synchronously (i.e. the distance between the two positions changes) between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations. For example, a configuration lock <b>1160</b> may be a rigid bar having a first configuration lock end <b>1164</b> connectable to first axle <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>and a second configuration lock end <b>1168</b> connectable to second axle <b>1044</b> <sub>3</sub>. Because first axle <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>and second axle <b>1044</b> <sub>3 </sub>move relative to one another when multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> moves between the multicopter and fixed-wing configurations, configuration lock <b>1160</b> is able to lock the position of the multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> by rigidly connecting the first and second axles <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1044</b> <sub>3</sub>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0180\">The length of each configuration lock <b>1160</b> corresponds to the distance between the two positions on the multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> in the associated configuration. For example, a multicopter lock will be sized according to the distance between the two positions on multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> when in the multicopter position, and the fixed-wing lock will be sized according to the distance between two positions on multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> when in the fixed-wing configuration. In the illustrated example, the multicopter lock <b>1160</b> <sub>1 </sub>has a lock length <b>1172</b> <sub>1 </sub>corresponding to the distance <b>1176</b> <sub>1 </sub>(<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 38</figref>) between first and second axles <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1044</b> <sub>3 </sub>when in the multicopter configuration, and fixed-wing lock <b>1160</b> <sub>2 </sub>has a lock length <b>1172</b> <sub>2 </sub>corresponding to the distance <b>1176</b> <sub>2 </sub>(<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 39</figref>) between first and second axles <b>1040</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1044</b> <sub>3 </sub>in the fixed-wing configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0181\">It will be appreciated that different configuration locks can be configured to connect to the same or different positions on multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>. For example, the multicopter and fixed-wing locks <b>1160</b> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>1160</b> <sub>2 </sub>can be configured to connect to the same pair of positions on multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> as each other, or can be configured to connect to different pairs of positions on multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0182\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref>, where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> is shown in accordance with another embodiment. As shown, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> includes a body <b>102</b> including a wing <b>104</b>. A multicopter <b>108</b> including rotors <b>132</b> is mounted to wing <b>104</b> by multicopter linkage <b>1004</b>. As exemplified, multicopter rotors <b>132</b> may be rotatably coupled (e.g. freely rotatably coupled) to body <b>102</b> by multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> between a multicopter configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 44</figref>) and a fixed-wing configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 45</figref>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0183\">Still referring to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref>, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> is similar to aerial vehicle <b>1000</b> in many respects, except for example the configuration of wing <b>104</b>. As shown, wing <b>104</b> extends forwardly and rearwardly of multicopter rotors <b>132</b>, and includes a plurality of rotor apertures <b>1204</b>. Collectively, rotor apertures <b>1204</b> are sized and positioned in alignment with multicopter rotors <b>132</b> to allow air moved by multicopter rotors <b>132</b> when in the multicopter configuration to flow through wing <b>104</b> substantially unobstructed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0184\">As shown, rear rotor apertures <b>1204</b> <sub>2 </sub>are also sized and positioned to provide passage for rear multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>to move from the multicopter configuration (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 44</figref>) to the fixed wing position (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 45</figref>). In the fixed wing configuration, rear multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>extend above wing <b>104</b>. A portion of multicopter linkage <b>1004</b> may extend through rear rotor apertures <b>1204</b> <sub>2 </sub>to support multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>2 </sub>above wing <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0185\">Wing <b>104</b> can have any number of rotor apertures <b>1204</b>. For example, wing <b>104</b> can have one rotor aperture <b>1204</b> for each multicopter rotor <b>132</b>, as shown. In other embodiments, wing <b>104</b> can have fewer rotor apertures <b>1204</b> than the number of multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. For example, a rotor aperture <b>1204</b> may be sized to align with a plurality of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> (e.g. one large rotor aperture <b>1204</b> may be sized and shaped to align with both front multicopter rotors <b>132</b> <sub>1</sub>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0186\">Rotor apertures <b>1204</b> can have any shape. In the illustrated example, rotor apertures <b>1204</b> are substantially quadrilateral. In other embodiments, rotor apertures <b>1204</b> can be circular, triangular, square, or another regular or irregular shape.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0187\">Any number of control surfaces <b>224</b> may be movably mounted (e.g. pivotably mounted) to wing <b>104</b>. The movement of control surfaces <b>224</b> may be controlled (e.g. by control signals from hardware controller <b>168</b>) to operate as ailerons for controlling roll, to operate as elevators for controlling pitch, to operate as a rudder to control yaw, or a combination thereof depending on the number, size, position, and orientation of control surfaces <b>224</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> is shown including three control surfaces <b>224</b>. Each control surface <b>224</b> may be individually activated (e.g. pivoted upwardly or downwardly) by actuators to create drag for controlling the movement of aerial vehicle <b>1100</b>. In some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> may have no control surfaces <b>224</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0188\">Aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> may include any number of rotors <b>192</b> which produce thrust to create torque for pitching body <b>102</b> relative to multicopter <b>108</b> or pitching aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> as a whole. For example, rotor <b>192</b> may be selectively activated to control the pitch of wing <b>104</b>. As shown, rotor <b>192</b> may be positioned in a rotor aperture <b>196</b> which penetrates wing <b>104</b>. In the illustrated example, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> includes one rotor aperture <b>196</b> and rotor <b>192</b> positioned rearward of multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. Alternatively, aperture <b>196</b> and rotor <b>192</b> may be positioned forward of multicopter rotors <b>132</b>. In other embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> may include a plurality of rotors <b>192</b> and apertures <b>196</b>, which may be arranged in any positional arrangement about wing <b>104</b>, as described above in connection with aerial vehicle <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, aerial vehicle <b>1100</b> may have no rotors <b>192</b> and no apertures <b>196</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0189\">Reference is now made to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 46-48</figref>, where like part numbers refer to like parts in the previous figures, and where an aerial vehicle <b>1200</b> is shown in accordance with another embodiment.

For example, body rotors <b>1404</b> may be rotatably connected to body <b>102</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0204\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 50A</figref> shows an example of aerial vehicle <b>1400</b> in a vertical thrust configuration. As shown, in the vertical thrust configuration, each of multicopter rotors <b>132</b> and body rotors <b>1404</b> may be oriented to produce vertical thrust (e.g. thrust in a direction that is within 30 degrees of parallel to a direction of gravity). This may permit multicopter rotors <b>132</b> and body rotors <b>1404</b> to cooperatively generate lift for vertical take-off and landing, as well as hovering, for example.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0205\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 50B</figref> shows aerial vehicle <b>1400</b> in a horizontal thrust configuration.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'BACKGROUND \\n     A central premise in modern cancer treatment is that patient diagnosis, prognosis, risk assessment, and treatment response prediction can be improved by stratification of cancers based on genomic, transcriptional and epigenomic characteristics of the tumor alongside relevant clinical information gathered at the time of diagnosis (for example, patient history, tumor histology and stage) as well as subsequent clinical follow-up data (for example, treatment regimens and disease recurrence events). \\n     With the release of multiple tumor and matched normal whole genome sequences from projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), there is great need for computationally efficient tools that can extract as much genomic information as possible from these enormous datasets (TCGA, 2008). Considering that a single patient&#39;s whole genome sequence at high coverage (&gt;30X) can be hundreds of gigabytes in compressed form, an analysis comparing a pair of these large datasets is slow and difficult to manage, but absolutely necessary in order to discover the many genomic changes that occurred in each patient&#39;s tumor. \\n     Breast cancer is clinically and genomically heterogeneous and is composed of several pathologically and molecularly distinct subtypes. Patient responses to conventional and targeted therapeutics differ among subtypes motivating the development of marker guided therapeutic strategies. Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many of the molecular subtypes and pathways found in tumors, suggesting that treatment of cell lines with candidate therapeutic compounds can guide identification of associations between molecular subtypes, pathways and drug response. In a test of 77 therapeutic compounds, nearly all drugs show differential responses across these cell lines and approximately half show subtype-, pathway and/or genomic aberration-specific responses. These observations suggest mechanisms of response and resistance that may inform clinical drug deployment as well as efforts to combine drugs effectively. \\n     There is currently a need to provide methods that can be used in characterization, diagnosis, treatment, and determining outcome of diseases and disorders. \\n     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \\n     The invention provides methods for generating databases that may be used to determine an individual&#39;s risk, in particular, for example, but not limited to, risk of the individual&#39;s predisposition to a disease, disorder, or condition; risk at the individual&#39;s place of work, abode, at school, or the like; risk of an individual&#39;s exposure to toxins, carcinogens, mutagens, and the like, and risk of an individual&#39;s dietary habits.

Other embodiments can be utilized and structural changes can be made without departing from the scope of the claims of the present invention. \\n     As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to \u201can allele \u201d includes a plurality of such alelles, and a reference to \u201ca cluster\u201d is a reference to one or more clusters and equivalents thereof, and so forth. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201ccurated\u201d means the relationships between a set of biological molecules and/or non-biological molecules that has been tested, analyzed, and identified according to scientific and/or clinical principles using methods well known in the art, such as molecular biological, biochemical, physiological, anatomical, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, ADME, and bioinformatic techniques, and the like. The relationships may be biochemical such as biochemical pathways, genetic pathways, metabolic pathways, gene regulatory pathways, gene transcription pathways, gene translation pathways, miRNA-regulated pathways, pseudogene-regulated pathways, and the like. \\n     High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation, and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. \\n     Studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), and many more are planned in the near future for a wide variety of tumors. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. \\n     With the release of multiple fully-sequenced tumor and matched normal genomes from projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), there is great need for tools that can efficiently analyze these enormous datasets. \\n     To this end, we developed BamBam, a tool that simultaneously analyzes each genomic position from a patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes using the aligned short-read data contained in SAM/BAM-formatted files (SAMtools library; Li H, Handsaker B, Wysoker A, Fennell T, Ruan J, Homer N, Marth G, Abecasis G, Durbin R; 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup. The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools.  Bioinformatics.  2009 Aug. 15; 25(16):2078-9. Epub 2009 Jun. 8). BamBam interfaces with the SAMtools library to simultaneously analyze a patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes using short-read alignments from SAM/BAM-formatted files. In the present disclosure the BamBam tool can be a sequence analysis engine that is used to compare sequences, the sequences comprising strings of information. In one embodiment, the strings of information comprise biological information, for example, a polynucleotide sequence or a polypetide sequence. In another embodiment, the biological information can comprise expression data, for example relative concentration levels of mRNA transcripts or rRNA or tRNA or peptide or polypeptide or protein. In another embodiment, the biological information can be relative amounts of protein modification, such as for example, but not limited to, phosphorylation, sulphation, actylation, methylation, glycosilation, sialation, modification with glycosylphosphatidylinositol, or modification with proteoglycan. \\n     This method of processing enables BamBam to efficiently calculate overall copy number and infer regions of structural variation (for example, chromosomal translocations) in both tumor and germline genomes; to efficiently calculate overall and allele-specific copy number; infer regions exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and discover both somatic and germline sequence variants (for example, point mutations) and structural rearrangements (for example, chromosomal fusions. Furthermore, by comparing the two genome sequences at the same time, BamBam can also immediately distinguish somatic from germline sequence variants, calculate allele-specific copy number alterations in the tumor genome, and phase germline haplotypes across chromosomal regions where the allelic proportion has shifted in the tumor genome. By bringing together all of these analyses into a single tool, researchers can use BamBam to discover many types of genomic alterations that occurred within a patient&#39;s tumor genome, often to specific gene alleles, that help to identify potential drivers of tumorigenesis. \\n     To determine if a variant discovered is somatic (that is, a variant sequence found only in the tumor) or a germline (that is, a variant sequence that is inherited or heritable) variant requires that we compare the tumor and matched normal genomes in some way. This can be done sequentially, by summarizing data at every genomic position for both tumor and germline and then combining the results for analysis. Unfortunately, because whole-genome BAM files are hundreds of gigabytes in their compressed form (1-2 terabytes uncompressed), the intermediate results that would need to be stored for later analysis will be extremely large and slow to merge and analyze. \\n     To avoid this issue, BamBam reads from two files at the same time, constantly keeping each BAM file in synchrony with the other and piling up the genomic reads that overlap every common genomic location between the two files. For each pair of pileups, BamBam runs a series of analyses listed above before discarding the pileups and moving to the next common genomic location. By processing these massive BAM files with this method, the computer&#39;s RAM usage is minimal and processing speed is limited primarily by the speed that the filesystem can read the two files. This enables BamBam to process massive amounts of data quickly, while being flexible enough to run on a single computer or across a computer cluster. Another important benefit to processing these files with BamBam is that its output is fairly minimal, consisting only of the important differences found in each file. This produces what is essentially a whole-genome diff between the patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes, requiring much less disk storage than it would take if all genome information was stored for each file separately. \\n     BamBam is a computationally efficient method for surveying large sequencing datasets to produce a set of high-quality genomic events that occur within each tumor relative to its germline. These results provide a glimpse into the chromosomal dynamics of tumors, improving our understanding of tumors&#39; final states and the events that led to them. An exemplary scheme of BamBam Data Flow is shown at  FIG. 1 . \\n     One particular exemplary embodiment of the invention is creation and use of a differential genetic sequence object. As used herein, the object represents a digital object instantiated from the BamBam techniques and reflects a difference between a reference sequence (for example, a first serquence) and an analysis sequence (for example, a second sequence). The object may be considered a choke point on many different markets. One might consider the following factors related to use and management of such objects from a market perspective:\\n         An object can be dynamic and change with respect to a vector of parameters (for example, time, geographic region, genetic tree, species, etc.)   Objects can be considered to have a \u201cdistance\u201d relative to each other objects or reference sequences. The distance can be measured according to dimensions of relevance. For example, the distance can be a deviation from a hypothetical normal or a drift with respect to time.   Objects can be indicative of risk: risk of developing disease, susceptibility to exposure, risk to work at a location, etc.   Objects can be managed for presentation to stakeholders: health care providers, insurers, patients, etc.\\n           Can be presented as a graphical object   Can be presented in a statistical format: single person, a population, a canonical human, etc.   \\n           A reference sequence can be generated from the objects to form a normalized sequence. The normalized sequence can be built based on consensus derived from measured objects.   Objects are representative of large sub-genomic or genomic information rather than single-gene alignments and are annotated/contain meta data readable by standard software.   Objects can have internal patterns or structures which can be detected: a set of mutations in one spot might correlate to a second set of mutations in another spot which correlates to a condition; constellation of difference patterns could be a hot spot; use multi-variate analysis or other AI techniques to identify correlations; detect significance of a hot spot (for example, presence, absence, etc.)   Objects related to a single person could be used as a security key       \\n\\n     Updating a differential sequence object: Update includes creating, modifying, changing, deleting, etc.;\\n         Can be based on a template   Can be a de novo object   Can be an existing object       \\n\\n     In an alternative exemplary embodiment the method can be used to acertain and predict responsiveness of a patient to treatment: anticipated, assumed, predicted, actual, and the like. \\n     In an alternative exemplary embodiment the method can be used to provide patient-specific instructions: prescription, recommendation, prognosis, and the like. \\n     In one embodiment, the method may be used to provide clinical information that can be used in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications, such as detection of cancer tissue, staging of cancer tissue, detection of metastatic tissue, and the like; detection of neurological disorders, such as, but not limited to, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson&#39;s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and their complications; developmental disorders such as DiGeorge Syndrome, autism, autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and the like; treatment of an infection, such as, but not limited to, viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection, leishmania, schistosomiasis, malaria, tape-worm, elephantiasis, infections by nematodes, nematines, and the like. \\n     In one embodiment, the method may be used to provide clinical information to detect and quantify altered gene structures, gene mutations, gene biochemical modifications, including alterations and/or modifications to messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), antisense RNA (asRNA), and the like, for a condition associated with altered expression of a gene or protein.

The methods described herein may be also used to detect and quantify altered gene expression; absence, presence, or excess expression of mRNAs; or to monitor mRNA levels during therapeutic intervention Disorders associated with altered expression include akathesia, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, amnesia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxias, bipolar disorder, catatonia, cerebral palsy, cerebrovascular disease Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, dementia, depression, Down&#39;s syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, dystonias, epilepsy, Huntington&#39;s disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, neuralgias, neurofibromatosis, neuropathies, Parkinson&#39;s disease, Pick&#39;s disease, retinitis pigmentosa, schizophrenia, seasonal affective disorder, senile dementia, stroke, Tourette&#39;s syndrome and cancers including adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and teratocarcinomas, particularly of the brain. \\n     In order to provide a basis for the diagnosis of a condition, disease or disorder associated with gene expression, a normal or standard expression profile is established. This may be accomplished by combining a biological sample taken from normal subjects, either animal or human, with a probe under conditions for hybridization or amplification. Standard hybridization may be quantified by comparing the values obtained using normal subjects with values from an experiment in which a known amount of a substantially purified target sequence is used. Standard values obtained in this manner may be compared with values obtained from samples from patients who are symptomatic for a particular condition, disease, or disorder. Deviation from standard values toward those associated with a particular condition is used to diagnose that condition. \\n     Such assays may also be used to evaluate the efficacy of a particular therapeutic treatment regimen in animal studies and in clinical trial or to monitor the treatment of an individual patient. Once the presence of a condition is established and a treatment protocol is initiated, diagnostic assays may be repeated on a regular basis to determine if the level of expression in the patient begins to approximate the level that is observed in a normal subject. The assays may also be used to detect, quamtify, or measure gene structures, gene mutations, gene biochemical modifications, including alterations and/or modifications to messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), antisense RNA (asRNA), and the like, that indicate and/or identify the presence of a tumor, absence of a tumor, or remission status of the individual undergoing a clinical treatment or therapy. The results obtained from successive assays may be used to show the efficacy of treatment over a period ranging from several days to months. \\n     The methods disclosed herein may also be used to detect, quantify, and correlate a change in gene structures, gene mutations, gene biochemical modifications, including alterations and/or modifications to messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), microRNA (miRNA), antisense RNA (asRNA), and the like, that has not been previously identified or associated with a particular clinical disease, disorder, or condition. In the alternative, the methods disclosed herein may be used to identify a novel clinical disease, disorder, or condition. Novel changes in gene structures, gene mutations, and gene biochemical modifications, may then be compared with known chemical and biochemical properties of a nucleic acid sequence or protein sequence and which correlate with a clinical disease, disorder, or condition may be used to generate new databases and knowledge about cellular metabolism for clinical use. \\n     Model Systems \\n     Animal models may be used as bioassays where they exhibit a toxic response similar to that of humans and where exposure conditions are relevant to human exposures. Mammals are the most common models, and most toxicity studies are performed on rodents such as rats or mice because of low cost, availability, and abundant reference toxicology. Inbred rodent strains provide a convenient model for investigation of the physiological consequences of under- or over-expression of genes of interest and for the development of methods for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. A mammal inbred to over-express a particular gene (for example, secreted in milk) may also serve as a convenient source of the protein expressed by that gene. \\n     Toxicology \\n     Toxicology is the study of the effects of agents on living systems. The majority of toxicity studies are performed on rats or mice to help predict the effects of these agents on human health. Observation of qualitative and quantitative changes in physiology, behavior, homeostatic processes, and lethality are used to generate a toxicity profile and to assess the consequences on human health following exposure to the agent. \\n     Genetic toxicology identifies and analyzes the ability of an agent to produce genetic mutations. Genotoxic agents usually have common chemical or physical properties that facilitate interaction with nucleic acids and are most harmful when chromosomal aberrations are passed along to progeny. Toxicological studies may identify agents that increase the frequency of structural or functional abnormalities in progeny if administered to either parent before conception, to the mother during pregnancy, or to the developing organism. Mice and rats are most frequently used in these tests because of their short reproductive cycle that produces the number of organisms needed to satisfy statistical requirements. \\n     Acute toxicity tests are based on a single administration of the agent to the subject to determine the symptomology or lethality of the agent. Three experiments are conducted: (a) an initial dose-range-finding experiment, (b) an experiment to narrow the range of effective doses, and (c) a final experiment for establishing the dose-response curve. \\n     Prolonged toxicity tests are based on the repeated administration of the agent. Rats and dog are commonly used in these studies to provide data from species in different families. With the exception of carcinogenesis, there is considerable evidence that daily administration of an agent at high-dose concentrations for periods of three to four months will reveal most forms of toxicity in adult animals. \\n     Chronic toxicity tests, with a duration of a year or more, are used to demonstrate either the absence of toxicity or the carcinogenic potential of an agent. When studies are conducted on rats, a minimum of three test groups plus one control group are used, and animals are examined and monitored at the outset and at intervals throughout the experiment. \\n     Transgenic Animal Models \\n     Transgenic rodents which over-express or under-express a gene of interest may be inbred and used to model human diseases or to test therapeutic or toxic agents. (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866; 5,175,383; and 5,767,337; incorporated herein by reference.) In some cases, the introduced gene may be activated at a specific time in a specific tissue type during fetal development or postnatally. Expression of the transgene is monitored by analysis of phenotype or tissue-specific mRNA expression in transgenic animals before, during, and after challenge with experimental drug therapies. \\n     Embryonic Stem Cells \\n     Embryonic stem cells (ES) isolated from rodent embryos retain the potential to form an embryo. When ES cells are placed inside a carrier embryo, they resume normal development and contribute to all tissues of the live-born animal. ES cells are the preferred cells used in the creation of experimental knockout and knockin rodent strains. Mouse ES cells, such as the mouse 129/SvJ cell line, are derived from the early mouse embryo and are grown under culture conditions well known in the art. Vectors for knockout strains contain a disease gene candidate modified to include a marker gene that disrupts transcription and/or translation in vivo. The vector is introduced into ES cells by transformation methods such as electroporation, liposome delivery, microinjection, and the like which are well known in the art. The endogenous rodent gene is replaced by the disrupted disease gene through homologous recombination and integration during cell division. Transformed ES cells are identified, and preferably microinjected into mouse cell blastocysts such as those from the C57BL/6 mouse strain. The blastocysts are surgically transferred to pseudopregnant dams and the resulting chimeric progeny are genotyped and bred to produce heterozygous or homozygous strains. \\n     ES cells are also used to study the differentiation of various cell types and tissues in vitro, such as neural cells, hematopoietic lineages, and cardiomyocytes (Bain et al. (1995) Dev. Biol. 168: 342-357; Wiles and Keller (1991) Development 111: 259-267; and Klug et al. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98: 216-224). Recent developments demonstrate that ES cells derived from human blastocysts may also be manipulated in vitro to differentiate into eight separate cell lineages, including endoderm, mesoderm, and ectodermnal cell types (Thomson (1998) Science 282: 1145-1147). \\n     Knockout Analysis \\n     In gene knockout analysis, a region of a human disease gene candidate is enzymatically modified to include a non-mammalian gene such as the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo; see, for example, Capecchi (1989) Science 244: 1288-1292). The inserted coding sequence disrupts transcription and translation of the targeted gene and prevents biochemical synthesis of the disease candidate protein. The modified gene is transformed into cultured embryonic stem cells (described above), the transformed cells are injected into rodent blastulae, and the blastulae are implanted into pseudopregnant dams. Transgenic progeny are crossbred to obtain homozygous inbred lines. \\n     Knockin Analysis \\n     Totipotent ES cells, present in the early stages of embryonic development, can be used to create knockin humanized animals (pigs) or transgenic animal models (mice or rats) of human diseases. With knockin technology, a region of a human gene is injected into animal ES cells, and the human sequence integrates into the animal cell genome by recombination. Totipotent ES cells that contain the integrated human gene are handled as described above. Inbred animals are studied and treated to obtain information on the analogous human condition. These methods have been used to model several human diseases. (See, for example, Lee et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95: 11371-11376; Baudoin et al. (1998) Genes Dev. 12: 1202-1216; and Zhuang et al. (1998) Mol. Cell Biol. 18: 3340-3349). \\n     Non-Human Primate Model \\n     The field of animal testing deals with data and methodology from basic sciences such as physiology, genetics, chemistry, pharmacology and statistics. These data are paramount in evaluating the effects of therapeutic agents on non-human primates as they can be related to human health. Monkeys are used as human surrogates in vaccine and drug evaluations, and their responses are relevant to human exposures under similar conditions. Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulata) and common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are the most common non-human primates (NHPs) used in these investigations. Since great cost is associated with developing and maintaining a colony of NHPs, early research and toxicological studies are usually carried out in rodent models. In studies using behavioral measures such as drug addiction, NHPs are the first choice test animal. In addition, NHPs and individual humans exhibit differential sensitivities to many drugs and toxins and can be classified as \u201cextensive metabolizers\u201d and \u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d of these agents. \\n     Exemplary Uses of the Invention \\n     Personalized medicine promises to deliver specific treatment(s) to those patients mostly likely to benefit. We have shown that approximately half of therapeutic compounds are preferentially effective in one or more of the clinically-relevant transcriptional or genomic breast cancer subtypes. These findings support the importance of defining response-related molecular subtypes in breast cancer treatment. We also show that pathway integration of the transcriptional and genomic data on the cell lines reveals subnetworks that provide mechanistic explanations for the observed subtype specific responses. Comparative analysis of subnet activities between cell lines and tumors shows that the majority of subtype-specific subnetworks are conserved between cell lines and tumors. These analyses support the idea that preclinical screening of experimental compounds in a well-characterized cell line panel can identify candidate response-associated molecular signatures that can be used for sensitivity enrichment in early-phase clinical trials. We suggest that this in vitro assessment approach will increase the likelihood that responsive tumor subtypes will be identified before a compound&#39;s clinical development begins, thereby reducing cost, increasing the probability of eventual FDA approval and possibly avoiding toxicity associated with treating patients unlikely to respond. In this study we have assessed only molecular signatures that define transcriptional subtypes and selected recurrent genome copy number abnormalities (CNAs). We anticipate that the power and precision of this approach will increase as additional molecular features such as genetic mutation, methylation and alternative splicing, are included in the analysis. Likewise, increasing the size of the cell line panel will increase the power to assess less common molecular patterns within the panel and increase the probability of representing a more complete range of the diversity that exists in human breast cancers. \\n     Here, we disclose a new software tool we have called BamBam that enables a rapid comparison of tumor (somatic) and germline matched sequencing datasets. The results output by BamBam are varied, producing an exhaustive catalogue of the somatic and germline variants contained by each patient&#39;s samples. This catalogue provides researchers with the ability to quickly find important changes that occurred during the tumor&#39;s development, but also provide high-quality variants present in the patient&#39;s germline that may indicate predisposition to disease. Further improvements of BamBam will consist of methods that specifically search for multiple types of variants occurring in the same genomic region (for example, one allele of a gene deleted, the other allele containing a truncating mutation by breakpoint) that may point to drivers of tumorigenesis. We also plan to extend BamBam&#39;s ability to processing more than pairs of genomes, as well as provide researchers with the ability to plug in their own analysis methods into BamBam&#39;s pipeline. \\n     In additional embodiments, the polynucleotide nucleic acids may be used in any molecular biology techniques that have yet to be developed, provided the new techniques rely on properties of nucleic acid molecules that are currently known, including, but not limited to, such properties as the triplet genetic code and specific base pair interactions. \\n     The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention and not as limitations. \\n     EXAMPLES \\n     Example I \\n     Dataset Synchronization via the Reference Genome \\n     All short reads are aligned to the same reference genome, making the reference genome a natural way of organizing sequence data from multiple, related samples. BamBam takes in two short read sequencing datasets, one from the tumor and the other a matched normal (\u201cgermline\u201d) from the same patient, and the reference genome, and reads these datasets such that all sequences in both datasets overlapping the same genomic position are available to be processed at the same time. This is the most efficient method for processing such data, while also enabling complex analyses that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish in a serialized manner, where each dataset is processed by itself, and results are only merged afterwards. \\n     Such a method is easily extendible to more than two related sequencing datasets. For example, if three samples, matched normal, tumor, and relapse, were sequenced, this method could be used to search for changes specific to the tumor &amp; the relapse sample, and changes specific only to the relapse, suggesting the relapse tumor has changed somewhat from the original tumor from which it had presumably derived. Also, one could use this same method to determine the inherited portions of a child&#39;s genome given sequenced samples from child, father, and mother. \\n     Example II \\n     Somatic and Germline Variant Calling \\n     Because BamBam keeps the sequence data in the pair of files in sync across the genome, a complex mutation model that requires sequencing data from both tumor and germline BAM files as well as the human reference can be implemented easily. This model aims to maximize the joint probability of both the germline genotype (given the germline reads and the reference nucleotide) and the genotype of the tumor (given the germline genotype, a simple mutation model, an estimate of the fraction of contaminating normal tissue in the tumor sample, and the tumor sequence data). \\n     To find the optimal tumor and germline genotype, we aim to maximize the likelihood defined by \\n         P ( D   g   , D   g   , G   g   , G   t   |\u03b1, r ) = P ( D   g   |G   g ) P ( G   g   |r ) P ( D   t   |G   g   , G   g \u03b1) P ( G   t   |G   g ) \\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n \\n         P ( D   1   g, D   1   t, G   1   g, G   1   t\u2524|\u03b1,r )= P ( D   1   g\u2524|G   1   g ) P ( G   1   g\u2524|r ) P ( D   1   t\u2524|G   1   g, G   1   t,  \u03b1) P ( G   1   t\u2524|G   1   g ) \\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n \\n     where r is the observed reference allele, \u03b1 the fraction of normal contamination, and the tumor and germline genotypes are defined by Gt=(t 1 , t 2 ) and Gg=(g 1 , g 2 ) where t 1 , t 2 , g 1 , g 2 , \u2208{A, T, C, G}. The tumor and germline sequence data are defined as a set of reads D t ={d t   1 , d t   2 , . . . , d t   m } and D g ={d g   1 , d g   2 , . . . , d g   n }, respectively, with the observed bases d t   i , d g   i  \u2208{A, T, C, G}. All data used in the model must exceed user-defined base and mapping quality thresholds. \\n     The probability of the germline alleles given the germline genotype is modeled as a multinomial over the four nucleotides: \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n             \\n               \\n                 P \\n                 \\ue8a0 \\n                 \\n                   ( \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       D \\n                       g \\n                     \\n                     | \\n                     \\n                       G \\n                       g \\n                     \\n                   \\n                   ) \\n                 \\n               \\n               = \\n               \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     n \\n                     ! \\n                   \\n                   \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         n \\n                         A \\n                       \\n                       ! \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         n \\n                         T \\n                       \\n                       ! \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         n \\n                         G \\n                       \\n                       ! \\n                     \\n                     \\ue89e \\n                     \\n                       \\n                         n \\n                         C \\n                       \\n                       ! \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n                 \\ue89e \\n                 \\n                   \\n                     \u220f \\n                     i \\n                     n \\n                   \\n                   \\ue89e \\n                   \\n                     P \\n                     \\ue8a0 \\n                     \\n                       ( \\n                       \\n                         \\n                           d \\n                           g \\n                           i \\n                         \\n                         | \\n                         \\n                           G \\n                           g \\n                         \\n                       \\n                       ) \\n                     \\n                   \\n                 \\n               \\n             \\n             , \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     where n is the total number of germline reads at this position and n A , n G , n C , n T  are the reads supporting each observed allele.

If the tumor and germline genotypes differ, the putative somatic mutation(s) will be reported along with its respective confidence. \\n     Maximizing the joint likelihood of both tumor and germline genotypes helps to improve the accuracy of both inferred genotypes, especially in situations where one or both sequence datasets have low coverage of a particular genomic position. Other mutation calling algorithms, such as MAQ and SNVMix, that analyze a single sequencing dataset are more likely to make mistakes when the non-reference or mutant alleles have low support (Li, H., et al. (2008) Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores, Genome Research, 11, 1851-1858; Goya, R. et al. (2010) SNVMix: predicting single nucleotide variants from next-generation sequencing of tumors, Bioinformatics, 26, 730-736). \\n     In addition to collecting allele support from all reads at a given genomic position, information on the reads are collected (such as which strand, forward or reverse, the read maps to, the position of the allele within the read, the average quality of the alleles, etc.) and used to selectively filter out false positive calls. We expect a random distribution of strands and allele positions for all of the allele supporting a variant, and if the distribution is skewed significantly from this random distribution (that is, all variant alleles are found near the tail end of a read), then this suggest that the variant call is suspect. \\n     Example III \\n     Overall and Allele-Specific Copy Number \\n     Overall somatic copy number is calculated using a dynamic windowing approach that expands and contracts the window&#39;s genomic width according to the coverage in either the tumor or germline data. The process is initialized with a window of zero width. Each unique read from either the tumor or germline sequence data will be tallied into tumor counts, Nt, or germline counts, Ng. The start and stop positions of each read will define the window&#39;s region, expanding as new reads exceed the boundaries of the current window. When either the tumor or germline counts exceed a user-defined threshold, the window&#39;s size and location are recorded, as well as the Nt, Ng, and relative coverage Nt. Tailoring the size of the Ng window according to the local read coverage will create large windows in regions of low coverage (for example, repetitive regions) or small windows in regions exhibiting somatic amplification, thereby increasing the genomic resolution of amplicons and increasing our ability to define the boundaries of the amplification. \\n     Allele-specific copy number is calculated similarly, except that only positions deemed heterozygous in the germline are included, as shown (see  FIG. 2 ). Heterozygosity is defined as a position in the germline that is believed to have two different alleles, one allele contributed by each parent. Majority and minority copy numbers are calculated using the same dynamic windowing technique described above for overall copy number in order to aggregate data in the same genomic neighborhood. The majority allele at a heterozygous site is defined herein as the allele that has the greatest number of supporting reads in the tumor dataset that overlap that genomic location, while the minority allele is allele that has the least support. All counts ascribed to the majority allele in both tumor and germline data will go towards calculation of the majority copy number, and similarly for the minority allele. The majority and minority allele counts are then normalized by the counts of both alleles in the germline data, Ng, to calculate majority and minority copy numbers. \\n     Allele-specific copy number is used to identify genomic regions exhibiting loss-of-heterozygosity (both copy-neutral and copy-loss) as well as amplifications or deletions specific to a single allele. This last point is especially important to help distinguish potentially disease-causing alleles as those that are either amplified or not-deleted in the tumor sequence data. Furthermore, regions that experience hemizygous loss (for example, one parental chromosome arm) can be used to directly estimate the amount of normal contaminant in the sequenced tumor sample, which can be used to improve the modeling of the germline and tumor genotypes described above. \\n       FIG. 2  shows an overview of allele-specific copy number calculation. Positions with heterozygous genotypes are determined using both germline and tumor sequencing data, as determined by the germline variant calling algorithm. All reads overlapping these locations are collected and the read support for each of the two alleles in the heterozygous genotype are found in both tumor and germline. The majority allele is determined to be the allele with the highest support, and majority copy number is calculated by normalizing this count by the overall number of reads at that position in the germline. \\n     Example IV \\n     Phasing Genotypes \\n     BamBam attempts to phase all heterozygous positions found in the germline by taking advantage of allelic imbalance caused by large scale genomic amplifications or deletions in the tumor. The majority vote base call is selected at every position in the tumor sequence data to construct the phased haplotype present in the tumor. The majority vote chooses the most abundant allele observed in the pool of short reads, which should select the allele that remains in the tumor after a deletion event or the duplicated allele of an amplification event. At each position, the allelic state of the germline is also identified, where a position is deemed homozygous if there exists only one allele with the requisite read support and heterozygous if at least two alleles have the required read support. The tumor&#39;s haplotype is assumed to represent one of the two parental haplotypes, where the second parental haplotype is derived as the sequence of germline alleles that do not belong to the tumor haplotype. This procedure is used genome-wide regardless of the allelic proportion in the tumor, so we expect the haplotype assignment of genotypes to be essentially random in regions that are equally balanced between major and minor alleles. Accurate phasing of germline sequence will only occur in regions that exhibit a consistent allelic imbalance resulting from a single genomic event (for example regional amplification or deletion) in the tumor. Validation of the tumor-derived haplotypes can be accomplished by comparing the tumor-derived haplotypes to phased genotypes available from the HapMap project (International HapMap Consortium (2007), Nature, 7164: 851-861). \\n     Example V \\n     Inferring Structural Variation Using Paired-End Clustering \\n     To identify putative intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements, BamBam searches for discordant paired reads where each read in the pair map to disparate regions of the reference sequence. Intra-chromosomal discordant pairs are those that have an abnormally large insert size (i.e. the genomic distance on the reference separating the paired reads exceeds a user-defined threshold) or those that map in an incorrect orientation (i.e. inversion). Inter-chromosomal discordant pairs are defined by paired reads that map to different chromosomes. All discordant paired-end reads that align to identical locations as other pairs are removed to avoid calling rearrangements supported by a large number of reads that are merely the result of the PCR amplification step in the short-read library&#39;s preparation. An overview of this process is shown in  FIG. 3 . \\n     All discordant paired-end reads are clustered according to their genomic locations to define an approximate genomic region where the breakpoint is believed to be. The aggregation process consists of grouping together the unique reads that overlap other reads on both sides of the putative breakpoint. The strand orientation of all overlapping reads must also match or are not include in the cluster of pairs. When the number of overlapping discordant pairs in a cluster exceeds a user-defined threshold, the breakpoint that describes the rearrangement is defined. If there are rearrangements present in both germline and tumor datasets at the same position, then they are compared as follows. Germline rearrangements require that the tumor and germline dataset support the same rearrangement since it is exceedingly unlikely that a structural variation observed in the germline would somehow be reversed in the tumor to precisely agree with the reference. On the other hand, somatic rearrangements must only be observed in the tumor sequencing data, and not substantially present in the germline dataset. Rearrangements that fulfill these requirements are stored for post-processing analysis and visualization, while those that do not are discarded as artifactual rearrangements caused by either the sequencing instrument, sample preparation (such as whole-genome amplification), or a systematic bias of the short-read mapping algorithm employed. \\n       FIG. 3  shows an overview of structural variation calling. The initial identification of a putative structural variant is identified by BamBam using discordantly mapped read pairs, where both reads fully map to the reference genome, but do so in an abnormal, non-reference manner. The putative breakpoints found by BamBam are then refined by a program called bridget using any available split-reads. \\n     Example VI \\n     Refinement of Structural Variation Using Split-Reads \\n     The breakpoints found initially by BamBam are approximate, in that they use fully-mapped reads that, by their nature, cannot overlap the actual junction of the breakpoint, since it represents sequence not present in the reference (or the germline dataset, in the case of a somatic rearrangement). To refine our knowledge of the location of the breakpoint, a program called Bridget was developed, which is summarized in  FIG. 4 . \\n     Bridget is given the approximate breakpoint found by BamBam and searches for all unaligned reads that are anchored near the putative breakpoint by a fully-mapped mate. Each of these unmapped reads have the potential to be \u201csplit reads\u201d that overlaps the rearrangement&#39;s breakpoint junction. Localized genomic sequences surrounding both sides of the breakpoint are broken up into a set of unique tiles (currently tile size=16 bp), and a tile database of the tile sequences and their location in the reference genome is built. A similar tile database is constructed for each unaligned read, by breaking up the read into tiles of the same size and noting their location within the read. Comparing the reference tile database and the unaligned tile database, the genomic location of each unaligned tile in the reference is determined. \u201cDual spanning sets\u201d of these locations are computed by determining the maximal set of tiles that are contiguous in BOTH the reference and unaligned reads, one for each side of the breakpoint. \\n     The minimum and maximum genomic locations of the \u201cdual spanning sets\u201d in reference coordinates precisely determine the breakpoint location, as well as the orientation (or strandedness) of the sequence. With the information describing the left and right boundaries of the breakpoint, the rearranged sequence is fully defined, that is, the left side is defined by (chromosome=chr1, location=1000 bp, strand=forward) and the right side is defined by (chromosome=chr5, location =500,000 bp, strand=reverse). The sequence homology of the breakpoint (that is, a short sequence, such as \u201cCA,\u201d observed to be identical on both boundaries of the breakpoint, but is observed only once in the aligned read at the junction of the two sequences) is also determined from these dual spanning sets. \\n     For each unaligned read, the dual spanning sets determine a potential location of the breakpoint. Since each unaligned read may determine slightly different locations for the breakpoint (due to sequence errors near the breakpoint, repetitive reference, etc.), all breakpoint locations determined from the dual spanning sets are used to generate possible junction sequences. All unmapped reads are newly aligned to each of these possible junction sequences and the overall improvement in their alignments is measured against how well the reads aligned to the original sequences. The junction sequence that yields the greatest improvement in alignment scores is judged as the best candidate for the true rearrangement. If this best junction sequence yields little-to-no improvement in the alignment scores, then this junction sequence is discarded as it is unlikely to represent the true rearrangement. In this case, it may also be determined that the lack of split-read confirmation is evidence that the original structural rearrangement found by BamBam could be artifactual. \\n       FIG. 4  shows an exemplary method to precisely identify the locations in the genome where the structural rearrangement occurred. Tiles (or kmers) are determined for both the potential split read and the reference genome. Dual spanning sets are determined (represent as the thick red and purple boxes on the bottom of this figure), which fully define how to construct the rearranged sequence. Dual spanning sets are robust to sequence errors or SNPs in the split read. \\n     Example VII \\n     Tumor-Specific Genome Browser \\n     To visualize all of the results output by BamBam, a tumor genome browser was developed that simultaneously displays all of the genomic variants found in a single tumor sample, versus its matched normal, as shown in  FIG. 5 . It is capable of displaying overall &amp; allele specific copy number, intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements, and mutations and small indels. It displays data in both linear and circular plots, the latter of which being much better suited for display inter-chromosomal rearrangements. \\n     By displaying the data together in a single image, the user can quickly navigate a single sample&#39;s data and understand the relationship between changes in copy number and a structural variation. For example, a large intra-chromosomal deletion-type rearrangement should have a concordant drop in copy number in the region between the breakpoints. Also, displaying mutation data with copy number data allows the user to understand if a somatic mutation was subsequently amplified, or if the wild-type allele was deleted in the tumor, both vital datapoints suggesting the importance of the genomic locus in this sample&#39;s tumorigenesis. \\n       FIG. 5  shows an exemplary tumor-specific genome browser. The browser shows all of the high-level somatic difference discovered by BamBam in a single image, enabling the synthesis of multiple distinct datasets to give an overall picture of the tumor&#39;s genome. The browser is able to zoom into and out of genomic regions rapidly, going from the full genome view, as shown above, to a single base resolution in just a few clicks. \\n     Example VIII \\n     Computational Requirements \\n     Both BamBam and Bridget were written in C, requiring only standard C libraries and the latest SAMtools source code (available from http://samtools.sourceforge.net). It may be run as a single process or broken up into a series of jobs across a cluster (for example, one job per chromosome). Processing a pair of 250 GB BAM files, each containing billions of 100 bp reads, BamBam will finish its whole-genome analysis in approximately 5 hours as a single process, or about 30 minutes on a modest cluster (24 nodes). BamBam&#39;s computational requirements were negligible, requiring only enough RAM to store the read data overlapping a single genomic position and enough disk space to store the well-supported variants found in either tumor or germline genomes. \\n     Bridget also had very modest computational requirements. Runtimes on a single machine were typically less than a second, which includes the time necessary to gather the reference sequence and any potential split-reads in the neighborhood of a breakpoint, build tile databases for both reference and split-reads, determine all dual spanning sets, construct potential junction sequences, re-align all split-reads to both reference and each junction sequence, and determine the best junction sequence. Regions that are highly amplified or have high numbers of unmapped reads increase the running time of Bridget, but this may be mitigated by the easy parallelizability of Bridget. \\n     Example IX \\n     Isolation of Genomic DNA \\n     Blood or other tissue samples (2-3 ml) are collected from patients and stored in EDTA-containing tubes at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. Genomic DNA is extracted from the blood samples using a DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer&#39;s instruction (PUREGENE, Gentra Systems, Minneapolis Minn.). DNA purity is measured as the ratio of the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (1 cm lightpath; A 260 /A 280 ) measured with a Beckman spectrophotometer. \\n     Example X \\n     Identification of SNPs \\n     A region of a gene from a patient&#39;s DNA sample is amplified by PCR using the primers specifically designed for the region. The PCR products are sequenced using methods well known to those of skill in the art, as disclosed above. SNPs identified in the sequence traces are verified using Phred/Phrap/Consed software and compared with known SNPs deposited in the NCBI SNP databank. \\n     Example XI \\n     Statistical Analysis \\n     Values are expressed as mean\u00b1SD. X 2  analysis (Web Chi Square Calculator, Georgetown Linguistics, Georgetown University, Washington D.C.) is used to assess differences between genotype frequencies in normal subjects and patients with a disorder. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis is performed as indicated to compare hemodynamics between different patient groups. \\n     Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various adaptations and modifications of the just-described embodiments can be configured without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Other suitable techniques and methods known in the art can be applied in numerous specific modalities by one skilled in the art and in light of the description of the present invention described herein.

Considering that a single patient&#39;s whole genome sequence at high coverage (&gt;30X) can be hundreds of gigabytes in compressed form, an analysis comparing a pair of these large datasets is slow and difficult to manage, but absolutely necessary in order to discover the many genomic changes that occurred in each patient&#39;s tumor.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Breast cancer is clinically and genomically heterogeneous and is composed of several pathologically and molecularly distinct subtypes. Patient responses to conventional and targeted therapeutics differ among subtypes motivating the development of marker guided therapeutic strategies. Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many of the molecular subtypes and pathways found in tumors, suggesting that treatment of cell lines with candidate therapeutic compounds can guide identification of associations between molecular subtypes, pathways and drug response. In a test of 77 therapeutic compounds, nearly all drugs show differential responses across these cell lines and approximately half show subtype-, pathway and/or genomic aberration-specific responses. These observations suggest mechanisms of response and resistance that may inform clinical drug deployment as well as efforts to combine drugs effectively.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">There is currently a need to provide methods that can be used in characterization, diagnosis, treatment, and determining outcome of diseases and disorders.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">The invention provides methods for generating databases that may be used to determine an individual&#39;s risk, in particular, for example, but not limited to, risk of the individual&#39;s predisposition to a disease, disorder, or condition; risk at the individual&#39;s place of work, abode, at school, or the like; risk of an individual&#39;s exposure to toxins, carcinogens, mutagens, and the like, and risk of an individual&#39;s dietary habits.

Thus, for example, a reference to \u201can allele \u201d includes a plurality of such alelles, and a reference to \u201ca cluster\u201d is a reference to one or more clusters and equivalents thereof, and so forth.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">As used herein, the term \u201ccurated\u201d means the relationships between a set of biological molecules and/or non-biological molecules that has been tested, analyzed, and identified according to scientific and/or clinical principles using methods well known in the art, such as molecular biological, biochemical, physiological, anatomical, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, ADME, and bioinformatic techniques, and the like. The relationships may be biochemical such as biochemical pathways, genetic pathways, metabolic pathways, gene regulatory pathways, gene transcription pathways, gene translation pathways, miRNA-regulated pathways, pseudogene-regulated pathways, and the like.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">High-throughput data is providing a comprehensive view of the molecular changes in cancer tissues. New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, DNA methylation, and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">Studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C), and many more are planned in the near future for a wide variety of tumors. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">With the release of multiple fully-sequenced tumor and matched normal genomes from projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), there is great need for tools that can efficiently analyze these enormous datasets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">To this end, we developed BamBam, a tool that simultaneously analyzes each genomic position from a patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes using the aligned short-read data contained in SAM/BAM-formatted files (SAMtools library; Li H, Handsaker B, Wysoker A, Fennell T, Ruan J, Homer N, Marth G, Abecasis G, Durbin R; 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup. The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools. <i>Bioinformatics. </i>2009 Aug. 15; 25(16):2078-9. Epub 2009 Jun. 8). BamBam interfaces with the SAMtools library to simultaneously analyze a patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes using short-read alignments from SAM/BAM-formatted files. In the present disclosure the BamBam tool can be a sequence analysis engine that is used to compare sequences, the sequences comprising strings of information. In one embodiment, the strings of information comprise biological information, for example, a polynucleotide sequence or a polypetide sequence. In another embodiment, the biological information can comprise expression data, for example relative concentration levels of mRNA transcripts or rRNA or tRNA or peptide or polypeptide or protein. In another embodiment, the biological information can be relative amounts of protein modification, such as for example, but not limited to, phosphorylation, sulphation, actylation, methylation, glycosilation, sialation, modification with glycosylphosphatidylinositol, or modification with proteoglycan.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">This method of processing enables BamBam to efficiently calculate overall copy number and infer regions of structural variation (for example, chromosomal translocations) in both tumor and germline genomes; to efficiently calculate overall and allele-specific copy number; infer regions exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and discover both somatic and germline sequence variants (for example, point mutations) and structural rearrangements (for example, chromosomal fusions. Furthermore, by comparing the two genome sequences at the same time, BamBam can also immediately distinguish somatic from germline sequence variants, calculate allele-specific copy number alterations in the tumor genome, and phase germline haplotypes across chromosomal regions where the allelic proportion has shifted in the tumor genome. By bringing together all of these analyses into a single tool, researchers can use BamBam to discover many types of genomic alterations that occurred within a patient&#39;s tumor genome, often to specific gene alleles, that help to identify potential drivers of tumorigenesis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">To determine if a variant discovered is somatic (that is, a variant sequence found only in the tumor) or a germline (that is, a variant sequence that is inherited or heritable) variant requires that we compare the tumor and matched normal genomes in some way. This can be done sequentially, by summarizing data at every genomic position for both tumor and germline and then combining the results for analysis. Unfortunately, because whole-genome BAM files are hundreds of gigabytes in their compressed form (1-2 terabytes uncompressed), the intermediate results that would need to be stored for later analysis will be extremely large and slow to merge and analyze.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">To avoid this issue, BamBam reads from two files at the same time, constantly keeping each BAM file in synchrony with the other and piling up the genomic reads that overlap every common genomic location between the two files. For each pair of pileups, BamBam runs a series of analyses listed above before discarding the pileups and moving to the next common genomic location. By processing these massive BAM files with this method, the computer&#39;s RAM usage is minimal and processing speed is limited primarily by the speed that the filesystem can read the two files. This enables BamBam to process massive amounts of data quickly, while being flexible enough to run on a single computer or across a computer cluster. Another important benefit to processing these files with BamBam is that its output is fairly minimal, consisting only of the important differences found in each file. This produces what is essentially a whole-genome diff between the patient&#39;s tumor and germline genomes, requiring much less disk storage than it would take if all genome information was stored for each file separately.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">BamBam is a computationally efficient method for surveying large sequencing datasets to produce a set of high-quality genomic events that occur within each tumor relative to its germline. These results provide a glimpse into the chromosomal dynamics of tumors, improving our understanding of tumors&#39; final states and the events that led to them. An exemplary scheme of BamBam Data Flow is shown at <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">One particular exemplary embodiment of the invention is creation and use of a differential genetic sequence object.

Novel changes in gene structures, gene mutations, and gene biochemical modifications, may then be compared with known chemical and biochemical properties of a nucleic acid sequence or protein sequence and which correlate with a clinical disease, disorder, or condition may be used to generate new databases and knowledge about cellular metabolism for clinical use.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0007\">Model Systems</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0073\">Animal models may be used as bioassays where they exhibit a toxic response similar to that of humans and where exposure conditions are relevant to human exposures. Mammals are the most common models, and most toxicity studies are performed on rodents such as rats or mice because of low cost, availability, and abundant reference toxicology. Inbred rodent strains provide a convenient model for investigation of the physiological consequences of under- or over-expression of genes of interest and for the development of methods for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. A mammal inbred to over-express a particular gene (for example, secreted in milk) may also serve as a convenient source of the protein expressed by that gene.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0008\">Toxicology</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0074\">Toxicology is the study of the effects of agents on living systems. The majority of toxicity studies are performed on rats or mice to help predict the effects of these agents on human health. Observation of qualitative and quantitative changes in physiology, behavior, homeostatic processes, and lethality are used to generate a toxicity profile and to assess the consequences on human health following exposure to the agent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0075\">Genetic toxicology identifies and analyzes the ability of an agent to produce genetic mutations. Genotoxic agents usually have common chemical or physical properties that facilitate interaction with nucleic acids and are most harmful when chromosomal aberrations are passed along to progeny. Toxicological studies may identify agents that increase the frequency of structural or functional abnormalities in progeny if administered to either parent before conception, to the mother during pregnancy, or to the developing organism. Mice and rats are most frequently used in these tests because of their short reproductive cycle that produces the number of organisms needed to satisfy statistical requirements.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0076\">Acute toxicity tests are based on a single administration of the agent to the subject to determine the symptomology or lethality of the agent. Three experiments are conducted: (a) an initial dose-range-finding experiment, (b) an experiment to narrow the range of effective doses, and (c) a final experiment for establishing the dose-response curve.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0077\">Prolonged toxicity tests are based on the repeated administration of the agent. Rats and dog are commonly used in these studies to provide data from species in different families. With the exception of carcinogenesis, there is considerable evidence that daily administration of an agent at high-dose concentrations for periods of three to four months will reveal most forms of toxicity in adult animals.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0078\">Chronic toxicity tests, with a duration of a year or more, are used to demonstrate either the absence of toxicity or the carcinogenic potential of an agent. When studies are conducted on rats, a minimum of three test groups plus one control group are used, and animals are examined and monitored at the outset and at intervals throughout the experiment.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0009\">Transgenic Animal Models</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0079\">Transgenic rodents which over-express or under-express a gene of interest may be inbred and used to model human diseases or to test therapeutic or toxic agents. (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,736,866; 5,175,383; and 5,767,337; incorporated herein by reference.) In some cases, the introduced gene may be activated at a specific time in a specific tissue type during fetal development or postnatally. Expression of the transgene is monitored by analysis of phenotype or tissue-specific mRNA expression in transgenic animals before, during, and after challenge with experimental drug therapies.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0010\">Embryonic Stem Cells</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0080\">Embryonic stem cells (ES) isolated from rodent embryos retain the potential to form an embryo. When ES cells are placed inside a carrier embryo, they resume normal development and contribute to all tissues of the live-born animal. ES cells are the preferred cells used in the creation of experimental knockout and knockin rodent strains. Mouse ES cells, such as the mouse 129/SvJ cell line, are derived from the early mouse embryo and are grown under culture conditions well known in the art. Vectors for knockout strains contain a disease gene candidate modified to include a marker gene that disrupts transcription and/or translation in vivo. The vector is introduced into ES cells by transformation methods such as electroporation, liposome delivery, microinjection, and the like which are well known in the art. The endogenous rodent gene is replaced by the disrupted disease gene through homologous recombination and integration during cell division. Transformed ES cells are identified, and preferably microinjected into mouse cell blastocysts such as those from the C57BL/6 mouse strain. The blastocysts are surgically transferred to pseudopregnant dams and the resulting chimeric progeny are genotyped and bred to produce heterozygous or homozygous strains.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0081\">ES cells are also used to study the differentiation of various cell types and tissues in vitro, such as neural cells, hematopoietic lineages, and cardiomyocytes (Bain et al. (1995) Dev. Biol. 168: 342-357; Wiles and Keller (1991) Development 111: 259-267; and Klug et al. (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 98: 216-224). Recent developments demonstrate that ES cells derived from human blastocysts may also be manipulated in vitro to differentiate into eight separate cell lineages, including endoderm, mesoderm, and ectodermnal cell types (Thomson (1998) Science 282: 1145-1147).</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0011\">Knockout Analysis</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0082\">In gene knockout analysis, a region of a human disease gene candidate is enzymatically modified to include a non-mammalian gene such as the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo; see, for example, Capecchi (1989) Science 244: 1288-1292). The inserted coding sequence disrupts transcription and translation of the targeted gene and prevents biochemical synthesis of the disease candidate protein. The modified gene is transformed into cultured embryonic stem cells (described above), the transformed cells are injected into rodent blastulae, and the blastulae are implanted into pseudopregnant dams. Transgenic progeny are crossbred to obtain homozygous inbred lines.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0012\">Knockin Analysis</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0083\">Totipotent ES cells, present in the early stages of embryonic development, can be used to create knockin humanized animals (pigs) or transgenic animal models (mice or rats) of human diseases. With knockin technology, a region of a human gene is injected into animal ES cells, and the human sequence integrates into the animal cell genome by recombination. Totipotent ES cells that contain the integrated human gene are handled as described above. Inbred animals are studied and treated to obtain information on the analogous human condition. These methods have been used to model several human diseases. (See, for example, Lee et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95: 11371-11376; Baudoin et al. (1998) Genes Dev. 12: 1202-1216; and Zhuang et al. (1998) Mol. Cell Biol. 18: 3340-3349).</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0013\">Non-Human Primate Model</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0084\">The field of animal testing deals with data and methodology from basic sciences such as physiology, genetics, chemistry, pharmacology and statistics. These data are paramount in evaluating the effects of therapeutic agents on non-human primates as they can be related to human health. Monkeys are used as human surrogates in vaccine and drug evaluations, and their responses are relevant to human exposures under similar conditions. Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, Macaca mulata) and common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are the most common non-human primates (NHPs) used in these investigations. Since great cost is associated with developing and maintaining a colony of NHPs, early research and toxicological studies are usually carried out in rodent models. In studies using behavioral measures such as drug addiction, NHPs are the first choice test animal. In addition, NHPs and individual humans exhibit differential sensitivities to many drugs and toxins and can be classified as \u201cextensive metabolizers\u201d and \u201cpoor metabolizers\u201d of these agents.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0014\">Exemplary Uses of the Invention</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0085\">Personalized medicine promises to deliver specific treatment(s) to those patients mostly likely to benefit. We have shown that approximately half of therapeutic compounds are preferentially effective in one or more of the clinically-relevant transcriptional or genomic breast cancer subtypes. These findings support the importance of defining response-related molecular subtypes in breast cancer treatment. We also show that pathway integration of the transcriptional and genomic data on the cell lines reveals subnetworks that provide mechanistic explanations for the observed subtype specific responses. Comparative analysis of subnet activities between cell lines and tumors shows that the majority of subtype-specific subnetworks are conserved between cell lines and tumors. These analyses support the idea that preclinical screening of experimental compounds in a well-characterized cell line panel can identify candidate response-associated molecular signatures that can be used for sensitivity enrichment in early-phase clinical trials. We suggest that this in vitro assessment approach will increase the likelihood that responsive tumor subtypes will be identified before a compound&#39;s clinical development begins, thereby reducing cost, increasing the probability of eventual FDA approval and possibly avoiding toxicity associated with treating patients unlikely to respond. In this study we have assessed only molecular signatures that define transcriptional subtypes and selected recurrent genome copy number abnormalities (CNAs). We anticipate that the power and precision of this approach will increase as additional molecular features such as genetic mutation, methylation and alternative splicing, are included in the analysis. Likewise, increasing the size of the cell line panel will increase the power to assess less common molecular patterns within the panel and increase the probability of representing a more complete range of the diversity that exists in human breast cancers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0086\">Here, we disclose a new software tool we have called BamBam that enables a rapid comparison of tumor (somatic) and germline matched sequencing datasets. The results output by BamBam are varied, producing an exhaustive catalogue of the somatic and germline variants contained by each patient&#39;s samples. This catalogue provides researchers with the ability to quickly find important changes that occurred during the tumor&#39;s development, but also provide high-quality variants present in the patient&#39;s germline that may indicate predisposition to disease. Further improvements of BamBam will consist of methods that specifically search for multiple types of variants occurring in the same genomic region (for example, one allele of a gene deleted, the other allele containing a truncating mutation by breakpoint) that may point to drivers of tumorigenesis. We also plan to extend BamBam&#39;s ability to processing more than pairs of genomes, as well as provide researchers with the ability to plug in their own analysis methods into BamBam&#39;s pipeline.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0087\">In additional embodiments, the polynucleotide nucleic acids may be used in any molecular biology techniques that have yet to be developed, provided the new techniques rely on properties of nucleic acid molecules that are currently known, including, but not limited to, such properties as the triplet genetic code and specific base pair interactions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0088\">The invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention and not as limitations.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0015\">EXAMPLES</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0016\">Example I</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0017\">Dataset Synchronization via the Reference Genome</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0089\">All short reads are aligned to the same reference genome, making the reference genome a natural way of organizing sequence data from multiple, related samples. BamBam takes in two short read sequencing datasets, one from the tumor and the other a matched normal (\u201cgermline\u201d) from the same patient, and the reference genome, and reads these datasets such that all sequences in both datasets overlapping the same genomic position are available to be processed at the same time. This is the most efficient method for processing such data, while also enabling complex analyses that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish in a serialized manner, where each dataset is processed by itself, and results are only merged afterwards.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0090\">Such a method is easily extendible to more than two related sequencing datasets. For example, if three samples, matched normal, tumor, and relapse, were sequenced, this method could be used to search for changes specific to the tumor &amp; the relapse sample, and changes specific only to the relapse, suggesting the relapse tumor has changed somewhat from the original tumor from which it had presumably derived. Also, one could use this same method to determine the inherited portions of a child&#39;s genome given sequenced samples from child, father, and mother.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0018\">Example II</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0019\">Somatic and Germline Variant Calling</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0091\">Because BamBam keeps the sequence data in the pair of files in sync across the genome, a complex mutation model that requires sequencing data from both tumor and germline BAM files as well as the human reference can be implemented easily. This model aims to maximize the joint probability of both the germline genotype (given the germline reads and the reference nucleotide) and the genotype of the tumor (given the germline genotype, a simple mutation model, an estimate of the fraction of contaminating normal tissue in the tumor sample, and the tumor sequence data).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0092\">To find the optimal tumor and germline genotype, we aim to maximize the likelihood defined by</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0000\"> <br/> <i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>, D</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>, G</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>, G</i> <sub>t</sub> <i>|\u03b1, r</i>) =<i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>|G</i> <sub>g</sub>)<i>P</i>(<i>G</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>|r</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>t</sub> <i>|G</i> <sub>g</sub> <i>, G</i> <sub>g</sub>\u03b1)<i>P</i>(<i>G</i> <sub>t</sub> <i>|G</i> <sub>g</sub>) \\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0000\"> <br/> <i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g, D</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>t, G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g, G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>t\u2524|\u03b1,r</i>)=<i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g\u2524|G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g\u2524|r</i>)<i>P</i>(<i>D</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>t\u2524|G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g, G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>t, </i>\u03b1)<i>P</i>(<i>G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>t\u2524|G</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>g</i>) \\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0000\">where r is the observed reference allele, \u03b1 the fraction of normal contamination, and the tumor and germline genotypes are defined by Gt=(t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) and Gg=(g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>) where t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, g<sub>1</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>, \u2208{A, T, C, G}.

Other mutation calling algorithms, such as MAQ and SNVMix, that analyze a single sequencing dataset are more likely to make mistakes when the non-reference or mutant alleles have low support (Li, H., et al. (2008) Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores, Genome Research, 11, 1851-1858; Goya, R. et al. (2010) SNVMix: predicting single nucleotide variants from next-generation sequencing of tumors, Bioinformatics, 26, 730-736).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0097\">In addition to collecting allele support from all reads at a given genomic position, information on the reads are collected (such as which strand, forward or reverse, the read maps to, the position of the allele within the read, the average quality of the alleles, etc.) and used to selectively filter out false positive calls. We expect a random distribution of strands and allele positions for all of the allele supporting a variant, and if the distribution is skewed significantly from this random distribution (that is, all variant alleles are found near the tail end of a read), then this suggest that the variant call is suspect.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0020\">Example III</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0021\">Overall and Allele-Specific Copy Number</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0098\">Overall somatic copy number is calculated using a dynamic windowing approach that expands and contracts the window&#39;s genomic width according to the coverage in either the tumor or germline data. The process is initialized with a window of zero width. Each unique read from either the tumor or germline sequence data will be tallied into tumor counts, Nt, or germline counts, Ng. The start and stop positions of each read will define the window&#39;s region, expanding as new reads exceed the boundaries of the current window. When either the tumor or germline counts exceed a user-defined threshold, the window&#39;s size and location are recorded, as well as the Nt, Ng, and relative coverage Nt. Tailoring the size of the Ng window according to the local read coverage will create large windows in regions of low coverage (for example, repetitive regions) or small windows in regions exhibiting somatic amplification, thereby increasing the genomic resolution of amplicons and increasing our ability to define the boundaries of the amplification.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0099\">Allele-specific copy number is calculated similarly, except that only positions deemed heterozygous in the germline are included, as shown (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>). Heterozygosity is defined as a position in the germline that is believed to have two different alleles, one allele contributed by each parent. Majority and minority copy numbers are calculated using the same dynamic windowing technique described above for overall copy number in order to aggregate data in the same genomic neighborhood. The majority allele at a heterozygous site is defined herein as the allele that has the greatest number of supporting reads in the tumor dataset that overlap that genomic location, while the minority allele is allele that has the least support. All counts ascribed to the majority allele in both tumor and germline data will go towards calculation of the majority copy number, and similarly for the minority allele. The majority and minority allele counts are then normalized by the counts of both alleles in the germline data, Ng, to calculate majority and minority copy numbers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0100\">Allele-specific copy number is used to identify genomic regions exhibiting loss-of-heterozygosity (both copy-neutral and copy-loss) as well as amplifications or deletions specific to a single allele. This last point is especially important to help distinguish potentially disease-causing alleles as those that are either amplified or not-deleted in the tumor sequence data. Furthermore, regions that experience hemizygous loss (for example, one parental chromosome arm) can be used to directly estimate the amount of normal contaminant in the sequenced tumor sample, which can be used to improve the modeling of the germline and tumor genotypes described above.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0101\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> shows an overview of allele-specific copy number calculation. Positions with heterozygous genotypes are determined using both germline and tumor sequencing data, as determined by the germline variant calling algorithm. All reads overlapping these locations are collected and the read support for each of the two alleles in the heterozygous genotype are found in both tumor and germline. The majority allele is determined to be the allele with the highest support, and majority copy number is calculated by normalizing this count by the overall number of reads at that position in the germline.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0022\">Example IV</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0023\">Phasing Genotypes</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0102\">BamBam attempts to phase all heterozygous positions found in the germline by taking advantage of allelic imbalance caused by large scale genomic amplifications or deletions in the tumor. The majority vote base call is selected at every position in the tumor sequence data to construct the phased haplotype present in the tumor. The majority vote chooses the most abundant allele observed in the pool of short reads, which should select the allele that remains in the tumor after a deletion event or the duplicated allele of an amplification event. At each position, the allelic state of the germline is also identified, where a position is deemed homozygous if there exists only one allele with the requisite read support and heterozygous if at least two alleles have the required read support. The tumor&#39;s haplotype is assumed to represent one of the two parental haplotypes, where the second parental haplotype is derived as the sequence of germline alleles that do not belong to the tumor haplotype. This procedure is used genome-wide regardless of the allelic proportion in the tumor, so we expect the haplotype assignment of genotypes to be essentially random in regions that are equally balanced between major and minor alleles. Accurate phasing of germline sequence will only occur in regions that exhibit a consistent allelic imbalance resulting from a single genomic event (for example regional amplification or deletion) in the tumor. Validation of the tumor-derived haplotypes can be accomplished by comparing the tumor-derived haplotypes to phased genotypes available from the HapMap project (International HapMap Consortium (2007), Nature, 7164: 851-861).</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0024\">Example V</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0025\">Inferring Structural Variation Using Paired-End Clustering</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0103\">To identify putative intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements, BamBam searches for discordant paired reads where each read in the pair map to disparate regions of the reference sequence. Intra-chromosomal discordant pairs are those that have an abnormally large insert size (i.e. the genomic distance on the reference separating the paired reads exceeds a user-defined threshold) or those that map in an incorrect orientation (i.e. inversion). Inter-chromosomal discordant pairs are defined by paired reads that map to different chromosomes. All discordant paired-end reads that align to identical locations as other pairs are removed to avoid calling rearrangements supported by a large number of reads that are merely the result of the PCR amplification step in the short-read library&#39;s preparation. An overview of this process is shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0104\">All discordant paired-end reads are clustered according to their genomic locations to define an approximate genomic region where the breakpoint is believed to be. The aggregation process consists of grouping together the unique reads that overlap other reads on both sides of the putative breakpoint. The strand orientation of all overlapping reads must also match or are not include in the cluster of pairs. When the number of overlapping discordant pairs in a cluster exceeds a user-defined threshold, the breakpoint that describes the rearrangement is defined. If there are rearrangements present in both germline and tumor datasets at the same position, then they are compared as follows. Germline rearrangements require that the tumor and germline dataset support the same rearrangement since it is exceedingly unlikely that a structural variation observed in the germline would somehow be reversed in the tumor to precisely agree with the reference. On the other hand, somatic rearrangements must only be observed in the tumor sequencing data, and not substantially present in the germline dataset. Rearrangements that fulfill these requirements are stored for post-processing analysis and visualization, while those that do not are discarded as artifactual rearrangements caused by either the sequencing instrument, sample preparation (such as whole-genome amplification), or a systematic bias of the short-read mapping algorithm employed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0105\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> shows an overview of structural variation calling. The initial identification of a putative structural variant is identified by BamBam using discordantly mapped read pairs, where both reads fully map to the reference genome, but do so in an abnormal, non-reference manner. The putative breakpoints found by BamBam are then refined by a program called bridget using any available split-reads.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0026\">Example VI</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0027\">Refinement of Structural Variation Using Split-Reads</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0106\">The breakpoints found initially by BamBam are approximate, in that they use fully-mapped reads that, by their nature, cannot overlap the actual junction of the breakpoint, since it represents sequence not present in the reference (or the germline dataset, in the case of a somatic rearrangement). To refine our knowledge of the location of the breakpoint, a program called Bridget was developed, which is summarized in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0107\">Bridget is given the approximate breakpoint found by BamBam and searches for all unaligned reads that are anchored near the putative breakpoint by a fully-mapped mate. Each of these unmapped reads have the potential to be \u201csplit reads\u201d that overlaps the rearrangement&#39;s breakpoint junction. Localized genomic sequences surrounding both sides of the breakpoint are broken up into a set of unique tiles (currently tile size=16 bp), and a tile database of the tile sequences and their location in the reference genome is built. A similar tile database is constructed for each unaligned read, by breaking up the read into tiles of the same size and noting their location within the read. Comparing the reference tile database and the unaligned tile database, the genomic location of each unaligned tile in the reference is determined. \u201cDual spanning sets\u201d of these locations are computed by determining the maximal set of tiles that are contiguous in BOTH the reference and unaligned reads, one for each side of the breakpoint.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0108\">The minimum and maximum genomic locations of the \u201cdual spanning sets\u201d in reference coordinates precisely determine the breakpoint location, as well as the orientation (or strandedness) of the sequence. With the information describing the left and right boundaries of the breakpoint, the rearranged sequence is fully defined, that is, the left side is defined by (chromosome=chr1, location=1000 bp, strand=forward) and the right side is defined by (chromosome=chr5, location =500,000 bp, strand=reverse). The sequence homology of the breakpoint (that is, a short sequence, such as \u201cCA,\u201d observed to be identical on both boundaries of the breakpoint, but is observed only once in the aligned read at the junction of the two sequences) is also determined from these dual spanning sets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0109\">For each unaligned read, the dual spanning sets determine a potential location of the breakpoint. Since each unaligned read may determine slightly different locations for the breakpoint (due to sequence errors near the breakpoint, repetitive reference, etc.), all breakpoint locations determined from the dual spanning sets are used to generate possible junction sequences. All unmapped reads are newly aligned to each of these possible junction sequences and the overall improvement in their alignments is measured against how well the reads aligned to the original sequences. The junction sequence that yields the greatest improvement in alignment scores is judged as the best candidate for the true rearrangement. If this best junction sequence yields little-to-no improvement in the alignment scores, then this junction sequence is discarded as it is unlikely to represent the true rearrangement. In this case, it may also be determined that the lack of split-read confirmation is evidence that the original structural rearrangement found by BamBam could be artifactual.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0110\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary method to precisely identify the locations in the genome where the structural rearrangement occurred. Tiles (or kmers) are determined for both the potential split read and the reference genome. Dual spanning sets are determined (represent as the thick red and purple boxes on the bottom of this figure), which fully define how to construct the rearranged sequence. Dual spanning sets are robust to sequence errors or SNPs in the split read.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0028\">Example VII</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0029\">Tumor-Specific Genome Browser</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0111\">To visualize all of the results output by BamBam, a tumor genome browser was developed that simultaneously displays all of the genomic variants found in a single tumor sample, versus its matched normal, as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>. It is capable of displaying overall &amp; allele specific copy number, intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements, and mutations and small indels. It displays data in both linear and circular plots, the latter of which being much better suited for display inter-chromosomal rearrangements.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0112\">By displaying the data together in a single image, the user can quickly navigate a single sample&#39;s data and understand the relationship between changes in copy number and a structural variation. For example, a large intra-chromosomal deletion-type rearrangement should have a concordant drop in copy number in the region between the breakpoints. Also, displaying mutation data with copy number data allows the user to understand if a somatic mutation was subsequently amplified, or if the wild-type allele was deleted in the tumor, both vital datapoints suggesting the importance of the genomic locus in this sample&#39;s tumorigenesis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0113\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary tumor-specific genome browser. The browser shows all of the high-level somatic difference discovered by BamBam in a single image, enabling the synthesis of multiple distinct datasets to give an overall picture of the tumor&#39;s genome. The browser is able to zoom into and out of genomic regions rapidly, going from the full genome view, as shown above, to a single base resolution in just a few clicks.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0030\">Example VIII</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0031\">Computational Requirements</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0114\">Both BamBam and Bridget were written in C, requiring only standard C libraries and the latest SAMtools source code (available from http://samtools.sourceforge.net). It may be run as a single process or broken up into a series of jobs across a cluster (for example, one job per chromosome). Processing a pair of 250 GB BAM files, each containing billions of 100 bp reads, BamBam will finish its whole-genome analysis in approximately 5 hours as a single process, or about 30 minutes on a modest cluster (24 nodes). BamBam&#39;s computational requirements were negligible, requiring only enough RAM to store the read data overlapping a single genomic position and enough disk space to store the well-supported variants found in either tumor or germline genomes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0115\">Bridget also had very modest computational requirements. Runtimes on a single machine were typically less than a second, which includes the time necessary to gather the reference sequence and any potential split-reads in the neighborhood of a breakpoint, build tile databases for both reference and split-reads, determine all dual spanning sets, construct potential junction sequences, re-align all split-reads to both reference and each junction sequence, and determine the best junction sequence. Regions that are highly amplified or have high numbers of unmapped reads increase the running time of Bridget, but this may be mitigated by the easy parallelizability of Bridget.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0032\">Example IX</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0033\">Isolation of Genomic DNA</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0116\">Blood or other tissue samples (2-3 ml) are collected from patients and stored in EDTA-containing tubes at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/839,047, filed on Jul. 19, 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/094,186, filed on Apr. 26, 2011, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. \\n    \\n    \\n     FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n     The invention relates to shaped compressed pellets and method of using the same in the slow release of well treatment agents into a well. The shaped compressed pellets are formed from a composite of a well treatment agent adsorbed onto a calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the porous metal oxide. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     Fluids produced from wells typically contain a complex mixture of components including aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, hetero-atomic molecules, anionic and cationic salts, acids, sands, silts and clays. The nature of these fluids, combined with the severe conditions of heat, pressure, and turbulence to which they are often subjected, are contributing factors to the formation and deposition of unwanted contaminants, such as scales, salts, paraffins, corrosion, bacteria and asphaltenes in oil and/or gas production wells. \\n     Such unwanted contaminants typically restrict the movement of fluids in production piping and further potentially plug flow paths of fluids (including reservoir flow paths). For instance, common mineral scales such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, or barium sulfate often precipitate from produced water and create blockages in flow paths in production tubulars. The formation and deposition of such unwanted contaminants reduce well productivity, and, in some cases, completely blocks the tubing. \\n     Treatments to remove deposits and inhibit the formation of unwanted deposits include the use of various mechanical preventative techniques such as scrapers or reamers and chemical treatment agents such as inhibitors, acids and converters. While mechanical tools are effective when the tubular is at an approximate 180\u00b0 to the point of entry (as gravity helps pull the treatment device into the well), they have limited effectiveness when the tubular being treated is deviated, as in a horizontal well or \u201cS\u201d shaped configuration. The flexibility of mechanical tools makes it difficult to push a long distance past a severe deviation or multiple deviations. Chemical prevention or remedial techniques can be effective if the treatment can be delivered reliably to the target location and in sufficient quantity to address the issues. \\n     Chemical treatment agents may be delivered to unwanted deposits by the technique of \u201cdownhole squeezing\u201d wherein a slug of a well treatment composition is injected into the annulus of the well, using a pre-flush, squeeze, and over flush treatment before the well can be returned to normal function. This technique requires large volumes of treatment and flush fluid in horizontal wells with a large area of perforated interval. Further treatments are typically required as the chemical residual is depleted, once again requiring large volumes of flush and treatment into the well. Such treatment methods are typically inefficient in horizontal wells because it is difficult to ensure the treatment is delivered to all the intended area. Further, the flush and chemical additives often require large pumps and holding tanks which can add significant costs to the application. \\n     Solid chemical additives in the form of a slurry are further often used. This type of treatment is effective in vertical wells but requires a flush to aid in delivery of the treatment agent to the bottom of the well. In a deviated well such as a horizontal well or well with multiple deviations such as an \u201cS\u201d shaped completion, it is important that the slurry mass not be too heavy in order for the flush to be carried past the deviation. If the density of the slurry is too high, the slurry just settles beyond the deviation. \\n     Capillary tubing lengths are frequently installed in wells to aid in delivery of a chemical treatment. This technique is effective in its intended function but is expensive and requires specialized equipment to install. Further, capillary tubing may not be able to extend to great depths if the deviation angle is severe or the piping extends far beyond the bend. \\n     While solid additives have been added to the well during the completion stage, this technique has only been proven to be an effective delivery method in new wells when the opportunity to spot the chemical additive is available. \\n     Alternative treatment methods have therefore been sought for introducing solid well treatment agents into producing oil and/or gas wells and especially in those where tubing is deviated or contains multiple deviations. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     In an embodiment, a shaped compressed pellet is disclosed. The pellet comprises a binder and a well treatment composite. The well treatment composite contains a well treatment agent and a calcined porous metal oxide. The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous metal oxide is such that the well treatment agent is adsorbed onto the surface of the calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the calcined porous metal oxide. \\n     In another embodiment, a method of inhibiting or controlling the rate of release of a well treatment agent in a well is disclosed by introducing into the well a shaped compressed pellet. The pellet comprises a binder and a well treatment composite. The well treatment composite contains a well treatment agent and calcined porous metal oxide. The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous metal oxide is such that the well treatment agent is adsorbed onto the surface of the calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the calcined porous metal oxide. \\n     In another embodiment, a method of inhibiting or controlling the rate of release of a well treatment agent in a well is disclosed by introducing into the well a shaped compressed pellet of a composite comprising a well treatment agent and calcined porous metal oxide. The well treatment agent is adsorbed onto the surface of the calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the calcined porous metal oxide. \\n     The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous metal oxide is such that the well treatment agent is adsorbed onto its surface or into its interstitial spaces. The surface area of the calcined porous metal oxide may be between from about 1 m 2 /g to about 10 m 2 /g. The diameter of the calcined porous metal oxide may be between from about 0.1 to 3 mm. The pore volume of the calcined porous metal oxide may be between from about to about 0.10 cc/g. The bulk density of the composite may be between from about 75 to about 150 lb/ft 3 . The specific gravity of the well treatment composite may be less than or equal to 3.75 g/cc. \\n     In another embodiment of the disclosure, a method of inhibiting or controlling the rate of release of a well treatment agent in a well is provided. In this embodiment, a shaped compressed pellet is placed into a receptacle. The shaped compressed pellet comprises a binder and a composite of a well treatment agent adsorbed onto a water-insoluble adsorbent or into interstitial spaces of the adsorbent. The receptacle is affixed to the bottom of a bottom hole electric submersible pump by hanging the receptacle from the bottom of the bottom hole electric submersible pump. The bottom hole electric submersible pump with the affixed receptacle is then lowered into the well. The well treatment agent is continuously released from the water-insoluble adsorbent. \\n     In another embodiment of the disclosure, a method of inhibiting or controlling the formation of unwanted deposits in a deviated well is provided. In this embodiment, a shaped compressed pellet is introduced into tubing within the well. The shaped compressed pellet comprises a well treatment composite. The well treatment composite comprises a well treatment agent and calcined porous metal oxide. The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous metal oxide is such that the well treatment agent is adsorbed onto the porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the porous metal oxide. The shaped compressed pellet is then flowed over obstructions within the tubing and deviations in the well into a targeted area in the well where unwanted deposits are undesired. The well treatment agent is then continuously released from the shaped compressed pellet into the targeted area. \\n     A major advantage of the shaped compressed pellets described herein is that their introduction into the well does not typically require any specialized equipment. They are especially useful in the treatment of production wells where traditional mechanical means are unable to reach. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       In order to more fully understand the drawings referred to in the detailed description of the present invention, a brief description of each drawing is presented, in which: \\n         FIG. 1A  and  FIG. 1B  are release profiles of a scale inhibitor in a high strength composites containing porous alumina adsorbents between 0 to 2,500 pore volumes and 0 to 10,000 pore volumes, respectively. \\n         FIG. 2  is a release profile of a scale inhibitor in high strength composites containing porous alumina adsorbent of varying diameter between 0 to 2,000 pore volumes. \\n         FIG. 3  is a release profile of a scale inhibitor in high strength composites containing porous alumina adsorbent of varying diameter using a sand pack using 50% of the particles as in  FIG. 2 . \\n         FIG. 4A  and  FIG. 4B  are release profiles of a scale inhibitor in high strength composites containing porous alumina adsorbents of varying diameters and sizes between 0 to 4,000 pore volumes and 0 to 10,000 pore volumes, respectively. \\n         FIG. 5  illustrates the inhibitor return curve for a compressed pellet of a composite of scale inhibitor and adsorbent in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix [Puck (C)] and an epoxy matrix [Puck (D). \\n         FIG. 6  illustrates the results of static breaker tests on a compressed pellet of a composite of scale inhibitor and adsorbent in an epoxy matrix [Puck (A)] and phenolic matrix [Puck (B)]. \\n         FIG. 7  illustrates the inhibitor return curve for a compressed pellet of a composite of scale inhibitor and adsorbent in a high melting polyethylene wax wherein only one of the pucks is coated with an epoxy resin. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     Characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure and additional features and benefits will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure and referring to the accompanying figures. It should be understood that the description herein and appended drawings, being of example embodiments, are not intended to limit the claims of this patent or any patent or patent application claiming priority hereto. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the claims. Many changes may be made to the particular embodiments and details disclosed herein without departing from such spirit and scope. \\n     As used herein and throughout various portions (and headings) of this patent application, the terms \u201cdisclosure\u201d, \u201cpresent disclosure\u201d and variations thereof are not intended to mean every possible embodiment encompassed by this disclosure or any particular claim(s). Thus, the subject matter of each such reference should not be considered as necessary for, or part of, every embodiment hereof or of any particular claim(s) merely because of such reference. \\n     Certain terms are used herein and in the appended claims to refer to particular components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, different persons may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function. Also, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are used herein and in the appended claims in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to . . . . \u201d Further, reference herein and in the appended claims to components and aspects in a singular tense does not necessarily limit the present disclosure or appended claims to only one such component or aspect, but should be interpreted generally to mean one or more, as may be suitable and desirable in each particular instance. \\n     The composites defined herein are used in the treatment of gas or oil wells in order to inhibit the formation of undesired contaminants, control the formation of undesired contaminants or retard the release of undesired contaminants into the well. For instance, the composite may be used in completion or production services. The composites of the invention may be used in the well to remove undesired contaminants from or control the formation of undesired contaminates onto tubular surface equipment within the wellbore. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment composite of the invention effectively inhibits, controls, prevents or treats the formation of inorganic scale formations being deposited in subterranean formations, such as wellbores, oil wells, gas wells, water wells and geothermal wells. The composites of the invention are particularly efficacious in the treatment of scales of calcium, barium, magnesium salts and the like, including barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate scales. The composites may further have applicability in the treatment of other inorganic scales, such as zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, etc. \\n     The well treatment composite may also be used to control and/or prevent the undesired formation of salts, paraffins, gas hydrates, asphaltenes as well as corrosion in formations or on surface equipment. \\n     The shaped compressed pellets defined herein may be characterized by a calcined porous substrate prepared from nano-sized material onto which may be adsorbed at least one well treatment agent. The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous substrate may be such that the well treatment agent may be absorbed into the interstitial spaces of the porous substrate. The amount of well treatment agent in the composite is normally from about 1 to 50 weight percent, preferably from about 14 to about 40 weight percent. \\n     The surface area of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 1 m 2 /g to about 10 m 2 /g, preferably between from about 1.5 m 2 /g to about 4 m 2 /g, the diameter of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 0.1 to about 3 mm, preferably between from about 150 to about 1780 micrometers, and the pore volume of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 0.01 to about 0.10 g/cc. Typically, the specific gravity of the well treatment composite is less than or equal to 3.75 g/cc. \\n     The calcined porous substrate is typically spherical and insoluble in well fluids under subterranean conditions, such as at temperatures less than about 250\u00b0 C. and pressures less than about 80 MPa. \\n     The porous substrate may be a metal oxide, such as alumina, zirconium oxide and titanium oxide. Typically, the porous substrate is alumina. \\n     The porous substrate may be prepared by first mixing a metal oxide hydrosol (such as aluminum oxide hydrosol) containing a hydrate of the metal oxide or activated metal (such as activated alumina) and an additive component selected from carbon (such as carbon black) or a high molecular weight natural organic material (such as wood flour and starch) which is insoluble in aqueous solution up to a temperature of 50\u00b0 C. and carbon with a solution of hydrolyzable base to form a mixture. The mixture may then be introduced in dispersed form into a water-immiscible liquid having a temperature of from about 60\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C., whereby gel particles are formed. The gel particles may then be aged in the liquid at the temperature and subsequently in an aqueous base, such as an aqueous ammonia solution. The aged particles may then be recovered. The recovered particles may then be calcined. During calcination, the additive component is removed. \\n     The calcined particles have a lower bulk density when the additive component is present during calcinations than when the additive component is not present. Typically, the bulk density of the well treatment composite is between from about 75 to about 150 lb/ft 3 . In addition, combustion of the additive component during calcinations of the hydrosol results in formation of pores of the calcined metal oxide. \\n     The metal oxide hydrosol may optionally contain a silica-containing substance which in their non-soluble form is coprecipitated with the metal oxide particles. The silica-containing substance is preferably a low density silica, such as that prepared by hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in an oxyhydrogen flame and known under the designation pyrogenic silica. \\n     In an embodiment, the porous substrate may be prepared from a concentrated metal oxide hydrosol of a pH value in the range of about 3 to about 5 which, in turn, is prepared by dissolving metal in hydrochloric acid and/or metal chloride in aqueous solution or by dissolving metal hydroxychloride in water, the concentration of which is adjusted so that metal oxide derived from the sol amounts to 15 to 35% by weight, preferably to 20 to 30% by weight of the mass of the calcined particles. Metal oxide hydrate and/or activated metal, preferably of an average particle diameter of maximally 10\u03bc, is then added to the hydrosol in an amount so that the metal oxide content amounts to 65 to 85% by weight, preferably 70 to 80% by weight of the calcined particles. Optionally, pyrogenic silica may be added to the hydrosol such that the SiO2 content of the calcined particles amounts to 10 to 40% by weight. A soft to medium-hard wood flour may then added to the mixture, the wood flour being ground to a finer particle size such that it is present in a quantity of 5 to 35% by weight, preferably 10 to 25% by weight relative to the mass of the calcined particles. The hydrosol containing the wood flour may then be mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of hexamethylene tetramine and then sprayed or dropped into a column filled with the mineral oil of a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. The gel particles are then allowed to remain at the temperature of precipitation for a period of time from 4 to 16 hours; thereafter the gel particles are aged for 2 to 8 hours in aqueous ammonia solution, washed with water, dried at 100\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C., or preferably at from about 120\u00b0 C. to about 200\u00b0 C., preheated to 250\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. and calcined at a temperature of 600\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0 C. \\n     In a preferred embodiment, when the metal oxide adsorbent is alumina adsorbent, the adsorbent may be prepared by hydrolyzing aluminum alkoxides to render nano sized alumina, drying to remove water and then introducing the dried aluminum in a dispersed form into an oil at a temperature of from about 60\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C., whereby gel particles are formed. The gel particles are then aged in the liquid and subsequently in an aqueous ammonia solution, recovered and then calcined. Nano sized alumina may be produced having an average diameter in the range from about 0.4 mm to about 1 mm. \\n     Alternative methods for making porous substrates adsorbent are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,587, herein incorporated by reference. \\n     Adsorption of the well treatment agent onto the calcined porous substrate and into the interstitial spaces of the substrate reduces (or eliminates) the amount of well treatment agent required to be in solution. For instance, where the well treatment agent is a scale inhibitor, the amount of scale inhibitor released from the composite is that amount required to prevent, or to at least substantially reduce the degree of, scale formation. For most applications, the amount of well treatment agent released from the composite may be as low as 1 ppm. Costs of operation are therefore significantly lowered. In light of the physical interaction between the well treatment agent and the porous substrate, only a small amount of well treatment agent may be released into the aqueous or hydrocarbon medium. \\n     Such shaped compressed pellets may further be used in stimulation of a well by being introduced into a subterranean formation or into the wellbore penetrating the subterranean formation. The pellets defined herein are sufficiently strong at high pressures to be used as a proppant in hydraulic fracturing operations including temperatures in excess of 250\u00b0 C. and pressures in excess of 80 MPa. When used in hydraulic fracturing (and/or sand control treatments), the porous particulate may be selected so to exhibit crush resistance under conditions as high as 10,000 psi closure stress, API RP 56 or API RP 60, generally between from about 250 to about 8,000 psi closure stress. \\n     When used in an oil, gas or geothermal well or a subterranean formation penetrated by such a well, the well treatment agent may be slowly released from the porous substrate and may be slowly released into a proppant pack. The composite thus exhibits the strength of a conventional proppant yet allows for the slow release of one or more well treatment agents into the formation and/or wellbore. In some instances, the well treatment composite may be used as the proppant per se. \\n     In an embodiment, the shaped compressed pellets may be a component of a fracturing fluid or acidizing fluid, such as a matrix acidizing fluid. The pellets may have particular applicability in completion fluids containing zinc bromide, calcium bromide calcium chloride and sodium bromide brines. Such fluids may be introduced down the annulus of the well and, when desired, flushed with produced water. \\n     The pellets may be used in combination with conventional proppants or sand control particulates. Such proppants or sand control particulates may be a conventional particulate material employed in hydraulic fracturing or sand control operations, e.g., sand ((having an apparent specific gravity (ASG), API RP 60, of 2.65)) or bauxite (having an ASG of 3.55). Alternatively, the proppant or sand control particulate may be \u201crelatively lightweight\u201d, defined as a particulate that has an ASG (API RP 56) that is less than about 2.45, more preferably less than or equal to 2.0, even more preferably less than or equal to 1.75, most preferably less than or equal to 1.25. Such different types of particulates may be selected, for example, to achieve a blend of different specific gravities or densities relative to the selected carrier fluid. For example, a blend of three different particles may be selected for use in a water fracture treatment to form a blend of well treatment particulates having three different specific gravities, such as an ASG of the first type of particle from about 1 to less about 1.5; an ASG of the second type of particle from greater than about 1.5 to about 2.0; and ASG of the third type of particle from about greater than about 2.0 to about 3.0; or in one specific embodiment the three types of particles having respective specific gravities of about 2.65, about 1.7 and about 1.2. In one example, at least one of the types of selected well treatment particulates may be selected to be substantially neutrally buoyant in the selected carrier or treatment fluid. In some instances, the well treatment composition may contain between from about 1 to about 99% by weight of conventional proppant. \\n     The pellets are particularly effective in hydraulic fracturing as well as sand control fluids such as water, salt brine, slickwater such as slick water fracture treatments at relatively low concentrations to achieve partial monolayer fractures, low concentration polymer gel fluids (linear or crosslinked), foams (with gas) fluid, liquid gas such as liquid carbon dioxide fracture treatments for deeper proppant penetration, treatments for water sensitive zones, and treatments for gas storage wells. \\n     When used in hydraulic fracturing, the composite may be injected into a subterranean formation in conjunction with a hydraulic fracturing fluid at pressures sufficiently high enough to cause the formation or enlargement of fractures. Since the particulates may withstand temperatures greater than about 370\u00b0 C. and closure stresses greater than about 8000 psi, they may be employed as the proppant particulate. Alternatively, the composite may be employed in conjunction with a conventional proppant. Since the porous particulate of the composite is insoluble, the composite may continue to function as a proppant even after the well treatment agent has been completely leached out of the composite. \\n     Fluids containing the well treatment composites may be used to optimize hydraulic fracture geometries and enhance well productivity. As an example, the fluids may be used to achieve increased propped fracture length in relatively tight gas formations. Choice of different particulate materials and amounts thereof to employ in such blends may be made based on one or more well treatment considerations including, but not limited to, objective/s of well treatment, such as for sand control and/or for creation of propped fractures, well treatment fluid characteristics, such as apparent specific gravity and/or rheology of carrier fluid, well and formation conditions such as depth of formation, formation porosity/permeability, formation closure stress, type of optimization desired for geometry of downhole-placed particulates such as optimized fracture pack propped length, optimized sand control pack height, optimized fracture pack and/or sand control pack conductivity and combinations thereof. The fracturing fluid, to be used with the composite, exhibits high viscosity, so as to be capable of carrying effective volumes of one or more proppants. It may include aqueous gels and hydrocarbon gels. \\n     In another embodiment, the well treatment composite may be used to pre-pack a screen for use in gravel packed wells. A screen assembly such as is known in the art may be placed or otherwise disposed within the wellbore so that at least a portion of the screen assembly is disposed adjacent the subterranean formation. In this embodiment, the composite is preferably placed as close to the point of equilibrium as possible in order to ensure the continuous release of the well treatment agent throughout the producing flow stream. A slurry including the composite and a carrier fluid may then be introduced into the wellbore and placed adjacent the subterranean formation by circulation or other suitable method so as to form a fluid-permeable pack in an annular area between the exterior of the screen and the interior of the wellbore that is capable of reducing or substantially preventing the passage of formation particles from the subterranean formation into the wellbore during production of fluids from the formation, while at the same time allowing passage of formation fluids from the subterranean formation through the screen into the wellbore. It is possible that the slurry may contain all or only a portion of the composite; the balance of the slurry may be another material, such as a conventional gravel pack particulate. \\n     Thus, the shaped pellets may be used as a preventative measure by stopping precipitation and deposition of the well treatment agent before it starts. Such alternatives are desired, for instance, when there is a need to increase the amount of the solid well treatment agent that can be placed in gravel packed wells there the amount of proppant or gravel placed in the well is at a minimum. In addition, the well treatment composites in prepacked screens may be used to increase the amount of solid substrate exposed during sand control. When used in sand control, screens prepacked with the well treatment composite may reduce intervention costs for remediation and further increases the effectiveness of the operation. Preferably, however, the screen used is of a size to reduce plugging by formation fines migration. \\n     As an alternative to use of a screen, the composite may be used in any method in which a pack of particulate material is formed within a wellbore that it is permeable to fluids produced from a wellbore, such as oil, gas, or water, but that substantially prevents or reduces production of formation materials, such as formation sand, from the formation into the wellbore. Such methods may or may not employ a gravel pack screen, may be introduced into a wellbore at pressures below, at or above the fracturing pressure of the formation, such as frac pack, and/or may be employed in conjunction with resins such as sand consolidation resins if so desired. \\n     The shaped compressed pellets defined herein may further be formed from a composite having a well treatment agent adsorbed onto a water-insoluble adsorbent. The composite may be those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,491,682 and 7,493,955, herein incorporated by reference. In addition, the compressed pellet may contain a weighting agent in order to increase the specific gravity of the pellet. \\n     The water insoluble adsorbent may be any of various kinds of commercially available high surface area materials having the affinity to adsorb the desired well treatment agent. Typically, the surface area of the adsorbent of the well treating composite is between from about 1 m 2 /g to about 100 m 2 /g. \\n     Suitable adsorbents include finely divided minerals, fibers, ground almond shells, ground walnut shells, and ground coconut shells. Further suitable water-insoluble adsorbents include activated carbon and/or coals, silica particulates, precipitated silicas, silica (quartz sand), alumina, silica-alumina such as silica gel, mica, silicate, e.g., orthosilicates or metasilicates, calcium silicate, sand (e.g., 20-40 mesh), bauxite, kaolin, talc, zirconia, boron and glass, including glass microspheres or beads, fly ash, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, ground walnut shells, fuller&#39;s earth and organic synthetic high molecular weight water-insoluble adsorbents. Particularly preferred are diatomaceous earth and ground walnut shells. \\n     Further useful as adsorbents are clays such as natural clays, preferably those having a relatively large negatively charged surface and a much smaller surface that is positively charged. Other examples of such high surface area materials include such clays as bentonite, illite, montmorillonite and synthetic clays. \\n     The weight ratio of well treatment agent to water-insoluble adsorbent in the composite is generally between from about 90:10 to about 10:90. \\n     As the oilfield fluid passes through or circulates around the well treatment composites, the well treatment agent slowly desorbs. In so doing, the composites are characterized by time-release capabilities. Gradual desorption of the well treatment agents insures that they are available to produced fluids for extended periods of time, typically extending for periods of time greater than a year and even as long as five years. Thus, the lifetime of a single treatment using the composite may be between 12 months and in excess of 5 years. \\n     The amount of well treatment agent in the composite is that amount sufficient to effectuate the desired release into the flowing produced fluid over a sustained period of time. Typically the resulting concentration of the well treatment agent in the wellbore is between from about 1 to about 50 ppm. In some instances, the amount of well treatment agent in the well produced fluid may be as low as 0.1 ppm. Such small amounts of well treatment agents in the produced fluid released from the composite forming the compressed pellet may be sufficient for up to 1,000 pore volumes. \\n     When placed into a well, the well treatment agent slowly dissolves at a generally constant rate over an extended period of time in the water or hydrocarbons which are contained in the formation and/or well. The composite therefore permits a continuous supply of the well treatment agent into the targeted area. \\n     The well treatment agent is slowly released from the compressed pellet after being introduced into a targeted area in the well. The targeted area may be a site in the well where deposits have already formed or a location in the well where it is desirable for deposits not to form. The compressed pellets provide a continuous supply of the well treatment agent into the targeted area. \\n     The pellets have particular applicability in areas within the well where conventional systems have been unable to reach. \\n     Use of the shaped pellets renders unnecessary the use of burdensome mechanical tools and procedures. While the shaped compressed pellets may be used to treat any type of well that requires chemical treatment, they have particular applicability in the treatment of production wells where traditional mechanical means such as wire lines or coil tubing have been unable to reach. For instance, the shaped pellets may be introduced directly into production tubing by being dropped directly into the well head or may be placed in a receptacle and lowered into the well. \\n     When introduced into production tubing within the well, the shape and specific gravity of the pellets causes the particulates to flow past obstructions and through well deviations such that the pellets may be placed at or in close proximity to the targeted area where treatment is desired. Continuous release of the well treatment agent with the production fluid further protects the tubular and the surface equipment from unwanted deposits which may otherwise be formed. Production from the well is thereby improved. \\n     Similar performance has been seen in producing wells where the shaped pellets are used simply to deploy production chemicals, particularly in horizontal wells where capillary deployment is not possible to the toe of the horizontal section of the well or where squeeze treatments are impractical; for example, in wells which have not been stimulated. \\n     The shaped pellets may be dropped directly into the well from the well head. When introduced into production tubing within an oil or gas well, the shaped pellets easily flow past obstructions and through well deviations. Continuous release of the well treatment agent with the production fluid protects the tubular and the surface equipment from unwanted deposits which may be formed in the tubular or surface equipment. The high specific gravity of the shaped pellets allows them to pass by gravity into and through production tubing. \\n     The shaped pellets are especially useful when introduced into horizontal or deviated wells since they easily pass through restrictions in the wellbore and flow into low points of the horizontal well or past obstruction in a deviated well. \\n     When shaped as spheres, the pellets are able to readily roll over obstructions within the tubing and thru well deviations to effectively place the well treatment agent in close proximity to the targeted area. The spheres are especially useful in delivering well treatment agents in wells having deviations ranging from 45\u00b0 to 89\u00b0 or in wells with multiple deviations such as \u201cS\u201d shaped completions. \\n     When formed to resemble hockey pucks, the shaped pellets may be placed into a receptacle and suspended at distant locations within the well. When the well treatment agent is depleted within the receptacle, the receptacle may then be pulled to the surface and reloaded with additional pellets. \\n     The shaped pellets may be in the form of a sphere, cylinder, rod or any other shape which allows for the slow release of the well treatment agent into the targeted area. In some applications, the shaped pellets are cylindrically shaped having a length of about 0.5 inch to about 6 inches, preferably from about 1 inch to about 2 inches and a diameter of from about 0.25 inch to about 4 inches, preferably from about 0.5 inch to about 1 inch. \\n     In those instances where the shaped pellet is to be directly dropped into the well from the well head, the pellet is preferably spherical and is formed into a ball-like sphere having a diameter between from about \u00bd inch to about 3 inches, more preferably from about \u00be inch to about 2\u00bd A inches, most preferably approximately 1\u00be inch. Such spheres resemble spherical balls. \\n     The specific gravity of the shaped pellets is generally between from about 1.1 to about 3. In a preferred embodiment, the specific gravity of the sphere is between from about 2 to about 2.5. \\n     Such specific gravity is especially desirable when the shaped pellets are spherical and where it is desired to drop the pellet directly into the well head. When used as one or more spherical balls, the pellets may be introduced into the well above the master valve at the wellhead. The isolation valve above the spherical ball(s) may then be closed and the master valve then opened. Gravitational forces will pull the ball(s) into the production tubing. The low specific gravity allows the sphere(s) to fall by gravitational forces through the production tubing. The combination of gravitational forces, specific gravity of the ball(s), sphericity of the ball(s) and size then allow the ball(s) to fall, sink or roll down the tubing and pass through restrictions in the wellbore. When introduced into a horizontal well, the spherical ball(s) will generally flow into the lowest point of the well. When introduced into a deviated well, the spherical pellets easily may flow past obstructions as they are pulled by gravity through the deviations in the well path where traditional mechanical means such as wire line or coil tubing may not be able to reach. The shaped pellets have applicability when used during completion of a well having multiple deviations such as those wells having an \u201cS\u201d shaped configuration. \\n     Once the spherical ball(s) reach their targeted area, they will slowly dissolve, providing a residual of the well treatment agent in produced fluids. Thus, the slow dissolution of the ball(s) provides the means to inhibit and/or remove unwanted deposits in the tubing. \\n     When dropped directly into the well head, it is often only necessary to use one spherical ball. Typically, no more than ten spherical balls need be used to effectuate the slow release of the well treatment agent. Slow dissolution of the spherical balls permits slow dissolution of the well treatment agent. \\n     The shaped pellets further are useful in gas wells having a tubing pressure of from about 1 to about 10,000 psi. Exemplary of such wells are shale gas wells. Further the spherical particulates have applicability in unobstructed tubulars. For instance, the spherical pellets are useful in those wells where the hydrocarbons are no longer freely flowing, such as wells on bottom hole electric submersible pumps (ESP). \\n     In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the shaped pellets may be simply lowered into the well. For instance, the particulates may be placed into a receptacle, such as a wire basket, and suspended at the bottom of the well by various means, such as by a wireline or by being hung to the bottom of a rod pump. When the particulates are depleted of the well treatment agent, the wire basket may then be pulled to the surface and reloaded with additional particulates for further treatment \\n     In another embodiment, the pellet may be placed into a receptacle and the receptacle then affixed to the bottom of a bottom hole electric submersible pump by hanging the receptacle from the bottom of the bottom hole electric submersible pump. The bottom hole electric submersible pump with the affixed receptacle may then be lowered into the well. \\n     The shaped compressed pellet may be used in completion or production services. The shaped compressed pellet may be used in the well to remove undesired contaminants from or control the formation of undesired contaminants onto tubular surface equipment within the wellbore \\n     The well treatment agent is preferably a liquid material. If the well treatment agent is a solid, it can be dissolved in a suitable solvent, thus making it a liquid. \\n     The well treatment agent is preferably water soluble or soluble in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment agent may be at least one member selected from the group consisting of demulsifying agents (both water-in-oil or oil-in-water), corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, paraffin inhibitors, gas hydrate inhibitors, salt formation inhibitors, asphaltene dispersants, foaming agents, oxygen scavengers, hydrogen sulfide scavengers, water soluble tracers, oil soluble traders, biocides and surfactants as well as other agents wherein slow release into the production well is desired. \\n     When fluid is produced, the well treatment agent may desorb into its respective solubilizing liquid. For instance, where a solid well treatment is an inhibitor for scales, corrosion, salts or biocidal action, the treatment agent may desorb into produced water. In the absence of water flow, the well treatment agent may remain intact on the solid adsorbent. As another example, solid inhibitors for paraffin or asphaltene may desorb into the hydrocarbon phase of produced fluid. \\n     The shaped pellets of the invention may be employed with carrier or treatment fluids in order to facilitate placement of the composite to a desired location within the formation. In this regard, any carrier fluid suitable for transporting the composite may be used. Well treatment compositions containing the composite may be gelled or non-gelled. In one embodiment, the well treatment composites described herein may be introduced or pumped into a well as neutrally buoyant particles in, for example, a saturated sodium chloride solution carrier fluid or a carrier fluid that is any other completion or workover brine known in the art. Suitable carrier fluids include or may be used in combination with fluids have gelling agents, cross-linking agents, gel breakers, surfactants, foaming agents, demulsifiers, buffers, clay stabilizers, acids, or mixtures thereof. The shaped compressed pellets may further be advantageously employed in liquefied gas and foamed gas carrier fluids, such as liquid CO2, CO2/N2, and foamed N2 in CO2 based systems. \\n     The carrier fluid may be a brine (such as a saturated potassium chloride or sodium chloride solution), salt water, fresh water, a liquid hydrocarbon, or a gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The amount of composite present in the well treating composition is typically between from about 15 ppm to about 100,000 ppm depending upon the severity of the scale deposition. Suitable compositions include fracturing fluids, completion fluids, acidizing compositions, etc. \\n     In a particularly preferred embodiment, the shaped compressed pellets are used in wells in order inhibit the formation of scales, control the formation of scales or retard the release of scale inhibitors into the well. Suitable scale inhibitors are those which are efficacious in the treatment of scales of calcium, barium, magnesium salts and the like, including barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate scales as well as inorganic scales, such as zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, etc. \\n     Suitable scale inhibitors are anionic scale inhibitors. \\n     Exemplary scale inhibitors are strong acidic materials such as a phosphonic acid, a phosphoric acid or a phosphorous acid, phosphate esters, phosphonate/phosphonic acids, the various aminopoly carboxylic acids, chelating agents, and polymeric inhibitors and salts thereof thereof. Included are organo phosphonates, organo phosphates and phosphate esters as well as the corresponding acids and salts thereof. \\n     Phosphonate/phosphonic acid type scale inhibitors are often preferred in light of their effectiveness to control scales at relatively low concentration. Polymeric scale inhibitors, such as polyacrylamides, salts of acrylamido-methyl propane sulfonate/acrylic acid copolymer (AMPS/AA), salts of sulfonated co-polymer (VS-Co), phosphinated maleic copolymer (PHOS/MA) or sodium salt of polymaleic acid/acrylic acid/acrylamido-methyl propane sulfonate terpolymers (PMA/AMPS), are also effective scale inhibitors. Sodium salts are preferred. \\n     Further useful, especially for brines, are chelating agents, including diethylenetriaminepentamethylene phosphonic acid and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid. \\n     Further preferred as scale removal agents are inorganic and organic strong acids such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and formic acid. Caustic scale removal agents may be employed to remove sulfate scales and may include sodium hydroxide, chelants such as EDTA, glucoheptonate, and urea. \\n     The well treatment agent may further be any of the fructans or fructan derivatives, such as inulin and inulin derivatives, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0325825, herein incorporated by reference. \\n     Exemplary of the demulsifying agents that are useful include, but are not limited to, condensation polymers of alkylene oxides and glycols, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide condensation polymers of di-propylene glycol as well as trimethylol propane; and alkyl substituted phenol formaldehyde resins, bis-phenyl diepoxides, and esters and diesters of the such di-functional products. Especially preferred as non-ionic demulsifiers are oxyalkylated phenol formaldehyde resins, oxyalkylated amines and polyamines, di-epoxidized oxyalkylated polyethers, etc. Suitable oil-in-water demulsifiers include poly triethanolamine methyl chloride quaternary, melamine acid colloid, aminomethylated polyacrylamide etc. \\n     Paraffin inhibitors useful as the well treatment agent include, but are not limited to, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, acrylates (such as polyacrylate esters and methacrylate esters of fatty alcohols), and olefin/maleic esters. \\n     Exemplary corrosion inhibitors useful for the practice of the invention include but are not limited to fatty imidazolines, alkyl pyridines, alkyl pyridine quaternaries, fatty amine quaternaries and phosphate salts of fatty imidazolines. \\n     Gas hydrate treating chemicals or inhibitors that are useful for the practice of the present invention include but are not limited to polymers and homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl caprolactam and amine based hydrate inhibitors such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2006/0223713 and 2009/0325823, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. \\n     Exemplary asphaltene treating chemicals include but are not limited to fatty ester homopolymers and copolymers (such as fatty esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid polymers and copolymers) and sorbitan monooleate. \\n     Suitable tracers include dyes (such as phenoxazone dyes, fluroescein, pyridinium betaines dyes, solvatochromatic dyes, Oregon Green, Cascade Blue, Lucifer yellow, Auramine O, tetramethylrhodamine, pysranine, sulforhodamines, hydroxycoumarins; polysulfonated pyrenes; cyanines, hydroxylamines, neutral red, acridine orange; acids (such as picric acid and salicylic acid) or salts thereof; ionizable compounds (such as those which provide ammonium, boron, chromate, etc., ions); and radioactive materials (such as krypton-85); isotopes; genetically or biologically coded materials; microorganisms; minerals; and high molecular weight synthetic and natural compounds and polymers (such as oligonucleotides, perfluorinated hydrocarbons like perfluoro butane, perfluoro methyl cyclopentane and perfluoro methyl cyclohexane). \\n     The tracer may also be a chelate, such as ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)) or a salt thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,329, herein incorporated by reference, discloses acceptable metal chelates formed by reacting aryl substituted ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid and a metal ion selected from the consisting of lead, cadmium and zinc. Such chelates react with fluorogenic agents, such as fluorescamine and o-phthalaldehyde. Fluorescence spectroscopy is then used to detect the chelate. \\n     The hydrogen sulfide scavenger may be an oxidant, such as an inorganic peroxide, e.g. sodium peroxide, or chlorine dioxide, or an aldehyde, e.g. of 1 to 10 carbons such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde or (meth)acrolein or an amine based scavenger, such as a triazine or a hexamine. \\n     Suitable foaming agents include, but are not limited to, those which are amphoteric, anionic or cationic. Preferred anionic foaming agents include betaines, alkyl ether sulfates, oxyalkylated sulfates, alkoxylated alcohol sulfates, phosphate esters, alkyl ether phosphates, alkoxylated alcohol phosphate esters, alkyl sulfates as well as alpha olefin sulfonates. Included as amphoteric surfactants are glycinates, amphoacetates, propionates, betaines and mixtures thereof. \\n     Exemplary surfactants include cationic, amphoteric, anionic and nonionic surfactants. Included as cationic surfactants are those containing a quaternary ammonium moiety (such as a linear quaternary amine, a benzyl quaternary amine or a quaternary ammonium halide), a quaternary sulfonium moiety or a quaternary phosphonium moiety or mixtures thereof. Suitable surfactants containing a quaternary group include quaternary ammonium halide or quaternary amine, such as quaternary ammonium chloride or a quaternary ammonium bromide. Included as amphoteric surfactants are glycinates, amphoacetates, propionates, betaines and mixtures thereof. The cationic or amphoteric surfactant may have a hydrophobic tail (which may be saturated or unsaturated) such as a C 12 -C 18  carbon chain length. Further, the hydrophobic tail may be obtained from a natural oil from plants such as one or more of coconut oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil. \\n     Preferred surfactants include N,N,N trimethyl-1-octadecammonium chloride: N,N,N trimethyl-1-hexadecammonium chloride; and N,N,N trimethyl-1-soyaammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof. Suitable anionic surfactants are sulfonates (like sodium xylene sulfonate and sodium naphthalene sulfonate), phosphonates, ethoxysulfates and mixtures thereof. \\n     Exemplary oxygen scavengers include triazines, maleimides, formaldehydes, amines, carboxamides, alkylcarboxyl-azo compounds cumine-peroxide compounds morpholino and amino derivatives morpholine and piperazine derivatives, amine oxides, alkanolamines, aliphatic and aromatic polyamines. \\n     The binder, to which the composite is added, generally serves to hold the well treatment agent and any desired additives agents together during compression. Suitable binders may be an organic binder or inorganic binder. Typical organic binders are those selected from resole or novolac resins, such as phenolic resole or novolac resins, epoxy-modified novolac resins, epoxy resins, polyurethane resins, alkaline modified phenolic resoles curable with an ester, melamine resins, urea-aldehyde resins, urea-phenol-aldehyde resins, furans, synthetic rubbers, silanes, siloxanes, polyisocyanates, polyepoxys, polymethylmethacrylates, methyl celluloses, crosslink entangled polystyrene divinylbenzenes, and plastics of such polymers as polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, polyolefins, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylacetates, silyl-modified polyamides and, optionally, a crosslinking agent. Typical inorganic binders include silicates, e.g., sodium silicate, aluminosilicates, phosphates, e.g., polyphosphate glass, borates, or mixtures thereof, e.g., silicate and phosphate. \\n     The amount of binder added to the composite to form the compressed pellet is typically from about 0.5 to about 50, preferably from about 1 to about 5 percent based on the total weight of the binder and composite, prior to compression. \\n     Prior to being shaped, a weighting agent may be combined with the composite and binder in order to impart to the shaped pellet a higher specific gravity. When present, the amount of weighting agent added to the composite is that amount needed to adjust the specific gravity of the shaped particulate to the requirements of the treated well. Suitable weighting agents include sand, glass, hematite, silica, sand, aluminosilicate, and an alkali metal salt or trimanganese tetraoxide. \\n     The shaped particulates may be produced by procedures known in the art. Typically the shaped particulates are formed by combining the well treatment composite and, optional, weighting agent, with a binder and then compressing the mixture in a mold of the desired shape or extruding the mixture into its desired shape. \\n     Exemplary of the process for making the shaped particulates is to combine the composite, prepared in accordance with the teachings set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955 or 7,494,711, with an organic binder and then compressing the mixture at a temperature between from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. at a pressure of from between 50 to about 5000 psi. The hardened particulates may then be screened to the desired size and shape. In another preferred embodiment, the shaped composites are produced by a continuous extrusion at a temperature between from about 400\u00b0 C. to about and 800\u00b0 C. \\n     The shaped particulates may further be coated with a resin, plastic or sealant which is resistant to the hydrocarbons produced in the well. Suitable resins include phenolic resins like phenol formaldehyde resins, melamine formaldehyde resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, polyamides, such as nylon, polyethylene, polystyrene, furan resins or a combination thereof. \\n     The coating layer serves to strengthen the compressed pellet, protect the pellet from harsh environmental conditions, protect the pellet from rupturing as it is lowered into the well and to lengthen the time of release of the well treatment agent from the pellet. The coating layer may be applied to the pellet by mixing the pellet and coating material in a vessel at elevated temperatures, typically from about 200 to about 350, preferably around 250\u00b0 F. An adherent, such as a resin adhesive or tackifying resin, may further be added to the vessel during mixing. The adherent may be used to assist the adhesion of the coating onto the compressed pellet. Alternatively, the coating layer may also be applied as a spray in a solvent based coating on the compressed pellet and then dried to remove the solvent. \\n     Adsorption of the well treatment agent onto the adsorbent reduces (or eliminates) the amount of well treatment agent required to be in solution. Since the well treatment agent is adsorbent onto a substrate, only a small amount of well treatment agent may be released into the aqueous medium. \\n     In another embodiment, the calcined porous metal oxide of the composite may be reactivated or recharged with the well treatment agent after at least a portion of the well treatment agent has been depleted. Such processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,686,081 and U.S. Patent Publication no. 2010/0175875, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. \\n     In this procedure, an initial charge of the composite may be injected into the well bore in a conventional method, whether for fracturing or for gravel packing. Such conventional methods include truck treating, continuous injection, or high pressure pumping, for example. The downhole matrix formed within the formation after the initial charge is comprised of the well treatment agent on a water-insoluble adsorbent as part of the sand matrix. \\n     Additional amounts of fluid containing the well treatment agent may be injected into the formation anytime after the initial charge of well treatment agent in the composite has at least partially depleted. Typically, the additional well treatment agent is introduced when the well treatment agent adsorbed onto the adsorbent or within the interstitial spaces of the composite has been substantially depleted and the performance level of the well treatment agent in the composite has become unacceptable. \\n     The injection of additional well treatment agent may be carried out in the same manner by which the initial composite was charged into the wellbore, and can be carried out in any conventional method of injecting fluids into a wellbore of an oil or gas well, as mentioned above. The fluid which is injected will typically be comprised of the desired well treatment agent(s) in a solution which further comprises a solvent. The relative amounts of the solvent and treatment agent of the solution to be injected into the wellbore will of course vary depending upon the agent and solvent involved, but will typically be of a solvent to treatment agent ratio in the range of about 10:90 to about 95:5, by weight. The solvent in one embodiment is xylene, toluene, or a heavy aromatic distillate or a mixture thereof. When a mixture of all of xylene, toluene and heavy aromatic distillate is used, the relative amounts of each solvent component can vary, but will be typically in variable weight ratios (xylene:toluene:heavy aromatic distillate) such as 10:70:20, 20:70:10, 70:20:10 or 20:10:70. In another embodiment, the solvent can be water (for water soluble well treatment agents). \\n     After the injection step is carried out, the wellbore is pressurized for a time and under conditions sufficient to reactivate the downhole matrix in the formation. This pressurization of material in the wellbore and formation fracture is commonly referred to as a \u201csqueeze.\u201d Reactivation of the treatment agent downhole may occur through the squeeze process as long as the activity of the treatment agent in the in-place matrix is increased relative to the treatment agent activity of the matrix just prior to injecting the solution. The determination of whether the treatment agent activity has increased relative to the activity of that agent just prior to injection of the solution and completion of the squeeze may be made through conventional residual analysis and comparison of the same before and after the squeeze, and conventional analysis of the physical well parameters, e.g., the production rate of the well and well pressure. \\n     The pressure to which the wellbore is pressurized in the squeeze process typically will be a pressure below the fracturing pressure, and when applicable, below the pressure that would cause the gravel pack to break up. In one embodiment of the invention, the pressure is in a range of about 500 to about 15000 psia. The duration for which the pressure condition is applied to the well will vary, depending upon the ease of fracturing, but will typically be in the range of about 2 to about 10 hours. \\n     The following examples are illustrative of some of the embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the description set forth herein. It is intended that the specification, together with the examples, be considered exemplary only, with the scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the claims which follow. \\n     EXAMPLES \\n     All percentages set forth in the Examples are given in terms of weight units except as may otherwise be indicated. \\n     Example 1 \\n     In accordance with the procedure set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,587, alumina spheres were prepared by hydrolyzing aluminum alkoxide. The resulting spheres were then dried to remove the water. The dried aluminum was then dispersed into an oil at about 90\u00b0 C. Gel particles were formed. \\n     Water insoluble spherical particles of greater than 95% alumina were recovered as Sample A. The spherical alumina beads consisted of bohemite alumina (non calcined) having a 1 mm diameter, a pore volume of 0.5 cc/g and a surface area of 216 m2/g. \\n     A portion of Sample A was calcined at 1200\u00b0 C. for 2 hours to render spherical beads of 1 mm diameter (Sample B) composed of alpha/delta theta alumina and having a pore volume of 0.08 cc/g and a surface area of 3 m 2 /g. \\n     A portion of Sample A was calcined at 1400\u00b0 C. for 2 hours to render spherical beads of 1 mm diameter (Sample C) composed of alpha alumina and having a pore volume of 0.03 cc/g and a surface area of 4 m 2 /g. \\n     Example 2 \\n     Each of Sample A, Sample B and Sample C were added at different weight percent loadings to commercial lightweight ceramic proppant, commercially available as CARBO LITE\u00ae from Carbo Ceramics Inc. of Dallas, Tex., and the crush was determined according to ISO13503-2: Measurement of Properties of Proppants used in Hydraulic Fracturing and Gravel Packing Operations) The results are shown in Table I below wherein the Comparative Sample is a 10/50 mesh diatomaceous earth (Celite MP-79): \\n                                         TABLE I                       Comparative Sample   Sample A   Sample B   Sample C       STRESS, psi   CONCENTRATION   CRUSH %   CRUSH %   CRUSH %   CRUSH %                                                        4000   0%   0.24   0.15   0.15   0.15           2%   NA   0.68   0.36   0.32           4%   NA   0.83   0.24   0.34           10%   5.88   3.16   0.61   0.39       6000   0%   0.92   0.92   0.92   0.92           2%   2.77   2.09   1.09   1.09           4%   5.08   4.18   1.09   0.90           10%   11.49   9.57   1.48   1.46       8000   0%   5.29   5.44   5.44   5.44           2%   7.14   8.38   6.22   5.61           4%   10.23   9.72   5.15   5.15           10%   17.21   17.30   5.44   5.03       10000   0%   NA   12.32   12.32   12.32           2%   NA   17.38   11.25   12.20           4%   NA   22.31   14.12   9.96           10%   NA   24.98   12.56   11.45                    \\nThe results indicate that the non-calcined Sample A has strength comparable to the diatomaceous earth of the Comparative Sample, whereas calcined Sample B and Sample C had the strength of commercial ceramic proppant in that even after the addition of 10% by weight of Sample B or Sample C the crush strength of the combined proppant particle mixtures, even at 10,000 psi stress, was not altered.\\n \\n     Example 3 \\n     Scale inhibitor amino tri(methylene phosphonic acid) (ATMP), commercially available as Dequest 2000 from ThermPhos International BV was adsorbed onto each of Sample A, Sample B and Sample C to render Samples FBG-90706-4A, FBG-90706-4B and FBG-90706-4C respectively. These Samples were prepared by first adsorbing water on the Samples to determine how much water could be adsorbed. Water was added to the sample until the Sample appeared wet. Sample A was found to adsorb 0.698 g of H2O/g of sample, Sample B adsorbed 0.362 g of H2O/g of sample, and Sample C adsorbed 0.415 g of H2O/g of sample. Next Dequest 2000 was added to each sample. Due to the low adsorbency compared to diatomaceous earth, two additions were followed to prepare the samples. In the first addition for Sample A, only 0.32 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample A could be added. In the second addition, 0.25 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample A could be added. This results in a product which contains about 22% active content. The method used to prepare the diatomaceous earth based product set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955 was adapted to these alumina samples. For Sample B, only 0.31 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample B could be added followed by 0.13 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample B in the second addition. This results in a product which contains about 18% active content. For Sample C, only 0.23 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample C could be added followed by 0.08 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample C in the second addition. This results in a product which contains about 13.5% active content.

The pore volume was approximately 12 mL. The column was eluted with synthetic brine (0.025 mol/L CaCl2, 0.015 mol/L NaHCO3, 1 mol/L NaCl, sparged with 100% CO2) at 60\u00b0 with a flow rate of 120 mL/hour. The synthetic brine was at saturation with calcite to simulate typical connate brine in the formation. The effluent solution was collected and analyzed for phosphorus and Ca concentration to obtain the inhibitor release profile. The results are shown in  FIG. 1A  and  FIG. 1B . The minimum effective concentration for scale inhibition was 0.1 ppm. \\n     Example 5 \\n     Five alumina samples labeled 23A, 23B, 23C, 23D and 23E were prepared. 23-A was the same as Sample A (1 mm alumina bead, not calcined); 23-B was the same as Sample B (1 mm alumina beads calcined at 1200\u00b0 C. for 2 hours) and 23-C was the same as Sample C (1 mm alumina bead calcined at 1400\u00b0 C. for 2 hours). Samples 23D and 23E were prepared using the same protocols as Sample B and Sample C, respectively, except the diameter of the spherical beads was adjusted to 0.8 mm. Each of 23A, 23B, 23C, 23D and 23E were heated to 225\u00b0 F. and cooled to room temperature in a desiccator before the addition of the ATMP solution. A 55% by weight solution of ATMP was prepared. Three additions were made to each sample and the amount that was able to be adsorbed is set forth in Table III below: \\n                                         TABLE III                                   % ATMP               g 1 st     g 2 nd     g 3 rd     by weight       Alumina   g Alumina   Addition   Addition   Addition   sample                                                        23A   50.001   3.00   3.25   0.84   7.2       23B   50.005   6.43   6.52   1.34   16.0       23C   50.004   5.29   1.83   0.70   7.9       23D   50.008   9.81   9.10   3.98   20.1       23E   50.006   9.93   3.80   2.02   14.8                    \\nThe results shown in Table III are in contrast to 22.1% for Sample A, 18.1% for Sample B and 13.5% for Sample C.\\n \\n     Example 6 \\n     The elution of Samples 22B, 23C, 23D, 23E and the Comparative Sample of Example 2 were performed as set forth by the method in Example 4 with 2% of the particles by weight of the sand in the column. The results are shown in  FIG. 2 . The results are similar to those illustrated in  FIG. 1A  and  FIG. 1B . Since there is commercial interest in using higher percentage of the particles in a proppant pack, the elution studies were performed on the samples at 50% of the particles in the sand pack and the results are shown in  FIG. 3 .  FIG. 3  indicates much slower release and longer period of effective inhibition. \\n     Example 7 \\n     Four samples were prepared of two different sizes (0.8 mm and 1.0 mm diameter before calcining) in accordance with the procedure set forth in Example 1. The four samples were labeled as CO10118 (0.8 mm), CO10118 (1 mm), CO10524 (0.8 mm) and CO10593 (1 mm). Sample CO10118, after calcining, had a size of 25 mesh (0.71 mm) and a surface area of 1 m 2 /g; sample CO10118, after calcining, had a size of 30 mesh (0.59 mm) and a surface area of less than 1 m 2 /g. Sample CO10524, after calcining, had a size of 30 mesh (0.59 mm) and a surface area of 5.6 m 2 /g and sample CO10593, after calcining, had a size of 20 mesh (0.84 mm) and a surface area of 7.3 m 2 /g. Crush analysis was conducted on each of the samples as well as on ECONOPROP\u00ae, a commercial proppant available from Carbo Ceramics Inc. Further, two other samples labeled 25 mesh APA1.0/3C 12853 (surface area 3.1 m 2 /g) and 30 mesh APA0.8/3C 12852 were also prepared. The crush data on these is presented also in Table 4. The crush data of each sample was generated using a pluviation method to load the proppant in the API crush cell.

The results are set forth in  FIG. 4A  and  FIG. 4B  and are compared to the results of 2% of loading of the composite exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955. The results are similar to those of Example 6 and show that the amount of composite may be tailored with the amount of proppant depending on the amount of water produced from the well and how long protection is desired. As illustrated, 2% of the particles in the sand and 50% particles in the sand may be used for the same purpose. \\n     Example 10 \\n     About 800 g of 10/50 mesh diatomaceous earth (Celite MP-79) absorbent was added into a mixing bowl. A paddle mixer blade was attached and liquid organophosphate (Solutia Dequest 2000) was added to the mixing bowl at a rate in which the liquid was readily absorbed, and the liquid did not puddle. After all of the liquid was added, mixing was continued until a homogenous blend was produced. The blend was then dried at 225 F until the percent moisture of the resulting product was less than 3%. The composite thus prepared contained 25 percent by weight of organophosphate scale inhibitor. To the composite was then added a binder of an epoxy resin (A), phenolic resin (B) and polyvinyl alcohol (C). The mixture contained about 50 percent by weight of the resin. The mixture was then compressed under a pressure of about 250 psi for about 1 minute in a mold to render a cylindrical pellet resembling a hockey puck having a diameter of about 1 inch and a thickness of about 0.5 inch to render puck (A), (B) and (C) corresponding to the epoxy resin binder, phenolic resin binder and polyvinyl alcohol binder, respectively. Puck (D) was obtained by coating Puck (C) with an epoxy resin by spray and drying. \\n     Example 11 \\n     The elution characteristics of Puck C and Puck D were then determined by packing approximately 440 grams 20/40 Ottawa white frac sand and 3 pieces of the pucks into a 30 cm length stainless steel column (ID=3.48 cm). The pore volume of the column was approximately 80 milliliters. The column was eluted with a synthetic brine (0.025 mol/L CaCl 2 , 0.015 mol/L NaHCO 3 , 1 mol/L NaCl, sparged with 100% CO 2 ) at 60\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of 270 ml/hour. The effluent solution was collected and analyzed for phosphorus and calcium concentration to obtain the inhibitor flow back curve, set forth in  FIG. 5 . As illustrated in  FIG. 5 , the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent gradually decreased as synthetic brine was pumped into the column. After 1200 pore volumes of return flow, the concentration of effluent phosphorus remained approximately 0.4 ppm. There was no significant difference found between the phosphorus return curves of Puck (C) and Puck (D). The data demonstrates the ease that the pucks have while flowing through production tubing. \\n     Example 12 \\n     Puck (A) and Puck (B) were mixed with 500 ml of water. After 30 minutes, the supernatant was removed and the concentration of phosphorus in the supernatant was measured by (ICP) spectrophotometer. The test was repeated 14 times. The amount of residual phosphorous in the supernatant, illustrated as the static breaker test, is illustrated in  FIG. 6 .  FIG. 6  demonstrates that the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent concentration of Puck (B) was higher than that of sample Puck (A) after washing with tap water. \\n     Example 13 \\n     To about 95% by weight of the composite of Example 5 was added about 5% by weight of a high melting polyethylene wax. The mixture was then compressed into a pellet having a diameter of 1 inch and about half inch in height to obtain Puck (E). Puck (F) was obtained by coating the compressed pellet of Puck (E) with about 20 weight % epoxy resin and drying the coated resin at 120\u00b0 F. Puck (E) and Puck (F) were then immersed in water at 180\u00b0 F. for five days. No deterioration was seen in either puck after 5 days. Puck (E) and Puck (F) were also immersed in W. Texas Crude Oil for two weeks at 140\u00b0 F. No deterioration was seen in either puck after two weeks. Elution studies were then conducted on Puck (E) and Puck (F) in accordance with the testing conditions of Example 11.  FIG. 7  represents the inhibitor flow back curve of Puck (E) and Puck (F). The results indicate the release of scale inhibitor above the minimum effective inhibitor concentration of 0.1 mg/l even after 1500 pore volumes of fluid elution through the column when the testing was terminated. The results of the release curve for the coated Puck (F) indicate no premature release of the inhibitor at the beginning which should result in longer effectiveness of the puck. \\n     From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

No. 12/839,047, filed on Jul. 19, 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/094,186, filed on Apr. 26, 2011, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0001\">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The invention relates to shaped compressed pellets and method of using the same in the slow release of well treatment agents into a well. The shaped compressed pellets are formed from a composite of a well treatment agent adsorbed onto a calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the porous metal oxide.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Fluids produced from wells typically contain a complex mixture of components including aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, hetero-atomic molecules, anionic and cationic salts, acids, sands, silts and clays. The nature of these fluids, combined with the severe conditions of heat, pressure, and turbulence to which they are often subjected, are contributing factors to the formation and deposition of unwanted contaminants, such as scales, salts, paraffins, corrosion, bacteria and asphaltenes in oil and/or gas production wells.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Such unwanted contaminants typically restrict the movement of fluids in production piping and further potentially plug flow paths of fluids (including reservoir flow paths). For instance, common mineral scales such as calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, or barium sulfate often precipitate from produced water and create blockages in flow paths in production tubulars. The formation and deposition of such unwanted contaminants reduce well productivity, and, in some cases, completely blocks the tubing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">Treatments to remove deposits and inhibit the formation of unwanted deposits include the use of various mechanical preventative techniques such as scrapers or reamers and chemical treatment agents such as inhibitors, acids and converters. While mechanical tools are effective when the tubular is at an approximate 180\u00b0 to the point of entry (as gravity helps pull the treatment device into the well), they have limited effectiveness when the tubular being treated is deviated, as in a horizontal well or \u201cS\u201d shaped configuration. The flexibility of mechanical tools makes it difficult to push a long distance past a severe deviation or multiple deviations. Chemical prevention or remedial techniques can be effective if the treatment can be delivered reliably to the target location and in sufficient quantity to address the issues.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Chemical treatment agents may be delivered to unwanted deposits by the technique of \u201cdownhole squeezing\u201d wherein a slug of a well treatment composition is injected into the annulus of the well, using a pre-flush, squeeze, and over flush treatment before the well can be returned to normal function. This technique requires large volumes of treatment and flush fluid in horizontal wells with a large area of perforated interval. Further treatments are typically required as the chemical residual is depleted, once again requiring large volumes of flush and treatment into the well. Such treatment methods are typically inefficient in horizontal wells because it is difficult to ensure the treatment is delivered to all the intended area. Further, the flush and chemical additives often require large pumps and holding tanks which can add significant costs to the application.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Solid chemical additives in the form of a slurry are further often used. This type of treatment is effective in vertical wells but requires a flush to aid in delivery of the treatment agent to the bottom of the well. In a deviated well such as a horizontal well or well with multiple deviations such as an \u201cS\u201d shaped completion, it is important that the slurry mass not be too heavy in order for the flush to be carried past the deviation. If the density of the slurry is too high, the slurry just settles beyond the deviation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Capillary tubing lengths are frequently installed in wells to aid in delivery of a chemical treatment. This technique is effective in its intended function but is expensive and requires specialized equipment to install. Further, capillary tubing may not be able to extend to great depths if the deviation angle is severe or the piping extends far beyond the bend.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">While solid additives have been added to the well during the completion stage, this technique has only been proven to be an effective delivery method in new wells when the opportunity to spot the chemical additive is available.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">Alternative treatment methods have therefore been sought for introducing solid well treatment agents into producing oil and/or gas wells and especially in those where tubing is deviated or contains multiple deviations.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">In an embodiment, a shaped compressed pellet is disclosed.

The well treatment agent is adsorbed onto the surface of the calcined porous metal oxide or into the interstitial spaces of the calcined porous metal oxide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous metal oxide is such that the well treatment agent is adsorbed onto its surface or into its interstitial spaces. The surface area of the calcined porous metal oxide may be between from about 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g to about 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g.

For instance, the composite may be used in completion or production services. The composites of the invention may be used in the well to remove undesired contaminants from or control the formation of undesired contaminates onto tubular surface equipment within the wellbore.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment composite of the invention effectively inhibits, controls, prevents or treats the formation of inorganic scale formations being deposited in subterranean formations, such as wellbores, oil wells, gas wells, water wells and geothermal wells. The composites of the invention are particularly efficacious in the treatment of scales of calcium, barium, magnesium salts and the like, including barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate scales. The composites may further have applicability in the treatment of other inorganic scales, such as zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">The well treatment composite may also be used to control and/or prevent the undesired formation of salts, paraffins, gas hydrates, asphaltenes as well as corrosion in formations or on surface equipment.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">The shaped compressed pellets defined herein may be characterized by a calcined porous substrate prepared from nano-sized material onto which may be adsorbed at least one well treatment agent. The porosity and permeability of the calcined porous substrate may be such that the well treatment agent may be absorbed into the interstitial spaces of the porous substrate. The amount of well treatment agent in the composite is normally from about 1 to 50 weight percent, preferably from about 14 to about 40 weight percent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">The surface area of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g to about 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g, preferably between from about 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g to about 4 m<sup>2</sup>/g, the diameter of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 0.1 to about 3 mm, preferably between from about 150 to about 1780 micrometers, and the pore volume of the calcined porous substrate is between from about 0.01 to about 0.10 g/cc. Typically, the specific gravity of the well treatment composite is less than or equal to 3.75 g/cc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">The calcined porous substrate is typically spherical and insoluble in well fluids under subterranean conditions, such as at temperatures less than about 250\u00b0 C. and pressures less than about 80 MPa.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0035\">The porous substrate may be a metal oxide, such as alumina, zirconium oxide and titanium oxide. Typically, the porous substrate is alumina.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0036\">The porous substrate may be prepared by first mixing a metal oxide hydrosol (such as aluminum oxide hydrosol) containing a hydrate of the metal oxide or activated metal (such as activated alumina) and an additive component selected from carbon (such as carbon black) or a high molecular weight natural organic material (such as wood flour and starch) which is insoluble in aqueous solution up to a temperature of 50\u00b0 C. and carbon with a solution of hydrolyzable base to form a mixture. The mixture may then be introduced in dispersed form into a water-immiscible liquid having a temperature of from about 60\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C., whereby gel particles are formed. The gel particles may then be aged in the liquid at the temperature and subsequently in an aqueous base, such as an aqueous ammonia solution. The aged particles may then be recovered. The recovered particles may then be calcined. During calcination, the additive component is removed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The calcined particles have a lower bulk density when the additive component is present during calcinations than when the additive component is not present. Typically, the bulk density of the well treatment composite is between from about 75 to about 150 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>. In addition, combustion of the additive component during calcinations of the hydrosol results in formation of pores of the calcined metal oxide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">The metal oxide hydrosol may optionally contain a silica-containing substance which in their non-soluble form is coprecipitated with the metal oxide particles. The silica-containing substance is preferably a low density silica, such as that prepared by hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride in an oxyhydrogen flame and known under the designation pyrogenic silica.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">In an embodiment, the porous substrate may be prepared from a concentrated metal oxide hydrosol of a pH value in the range of about 3 to about 5 which, in turn, is prepared by dissolving metal in hydrochloric acid and/or metal chloride in aqueous solution or by dissolving metal hydroxychloride in water, the concentration of which is adjusted so that metal oxide derived from the sol amounts to 15 to 35% by weight, preferably to 20 to 30% by weight of the mass of the calcined particles. Metal oxide hydrate and/or activated metal, preferably of an average particle diameter of maximally 10\u03bc, is then added to the hydrosol in an amount so that the metal oxide content amounts to 65 to 85% by weight, preferably 70 to 80% by weight of the calcined particles. Optionally, pyrogenic silica may be added to the hydrosol such that the SiO2 content of the calcined particles amounts to 10 to 40% by weight. A soft to medium-hard wood flour may then added to the mixture, the wood flour being ground to a finer particle size such that it is present in a quantity of 5 to 35% by weight, preferably 10 to 25% by weight relative to the mass of the calcined particles. The hydrosol containing the wood flour may then be mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of hexamethylene tetramine and then sprayed or dropped into a column filled with the mineral oil of a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. to 100\u00b0 C. The gel particles are then allowed to remain at the temperature of precipitation for a period of time from 4 to 16 hours; thereafter the gel particles are aged for 2 to 8 hours in aqueous ammonia solution, washed with water, dried at 100\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C., or preferably at from about 120\u00b0 C. to about 200\u00b0 C., preheated to 250\u00b0 C. to 400\u00b0 C. and calcined at a temperature of 600\u00b0 C. to about 1000\u00b0 C.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">In a preferred embodiment, when the metal oxide adsorbent is alumina adsorbent, the adsorbent may be prepared by hydrolyzing aluminum alkoxides to render nano sized alumina, drying to remove water and then introducing the dried aluminum in a dispersed form into an oil at a temperature of from about 60\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 C., whereby gel particles are formed. The gel particles are then aged in the liquid and subsequently in an aqueous ammonia solution, recovered and then calcined. Nano sized alumina may be produced having an average diameter in the range from about 0.4 mm to about 1 mm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Alternative methods for making porous substrates adsorbent are further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,587, herein incorporated by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">Adsorption of the well treatment agent onto the calcined porous substrate and into the interstitial spaces of the substrate reduces (or eliminates) the amount of well treatment agent required to be in solution. For instance, where the well treatment agent is a scale inhibitor, the amount of scale inhibitor released from the composite is that amount required to prevent, or to at least substantially reduce the degree of, scale formation. For most applications, the amount of well treatment agent released from the composite may be as low as 1 ppm. Costs of operation are therefore significantly lowered. In light of the physical interaction between the well treatment agent and the porous substrate, only a small amount of well treatment agent may be released into the aqueous or hydrocarbon medium.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">Such shaped compressed pellets may further be used in stimulation of a well by being introduced into a subterranean formation or into the wellbore penetrating the subterranean formation. The pellets defined herein are sufficiently strong at high pressures to be used as a proppant in hydraulic fracturing operations including temperatures in excess of 250\u00b0 C. and pressures in excess of 80 MPa. When used in hydraulic fracturing (and/or sand control treatments), the porous particulate may be selected so to exhibit crush resistance under conditions as high as 10,000 psi closure stress, API RP 56 or API RP 60, generally between from about 250 to about 8,000 psi closure stress.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0044\">When used in an oil, gas or geothermal well or a subterranean formation penetrated by such a well, the well treatment agent may be slowly released from the porous substrate and may be slowly released into a proppant pack. The composite thus exhibits the strength of a conventional proppant yet allows for the slow release of one or more well treatment agents into the formation and/or wellbore. In some instances, the well treatment composite may be used as the proppant per se.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">In an embodiment, the shaped compressed pellets may be a component of a fracturing fluid or acidizing fluid, such as a matrix acidizing fluid. The pellets may have particular applicability in completion fluids containing zinc bromide, calcium bromide calcium chloride and sodium bromide brines. Such fluids may be introduced down the annulus of the well and, when desired, flushed with produced water.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0046\">The pellets may be used in combination with conventional proppants or sand control particulates. Such proppants or sand control particulates may be a conventional particulate material employed in hydraulic fracturing or sand control operations, e.g., sand ((having an apparent specific gravity (ASG), API RP 60, of 2.65)) or bauxite (having an ASG of 3.55). Alternatively, the proppant or sand control particulate may be \u201crelatively lightweight\u201d, defined as a particulate that has an ASG (API RP 56) that is less than about 2.45, more preferably less than or equal to 2.0, even more preferably less than or equal to 1.75, most preferably less than or equal to 1.25. Such different types of particulates may be selected, for example, to achieve a blend of different specific gravities or densities relative to the selected carrier fluid. For example, a blend of three different particles may be selected for use in a water fracture treatment to form a blend of well treatment particulates having three different specific gravities, such as an ASG of the first type of particle from about 1 to less about 1.5; an ASG of the second type of particle from greater than about 1.5 to about 2.0; and ASG of the third type of particle from about greater than about 2.0 to about 3.0; or in one specific embodiment the three types of particles having respective specific gravities of about 2.65, about 1.7 and about 1.2. In one example, at least one of the types of selected well treatment particulates may be selected to be substantially neutrally buoyant in the selected carrier or treatment fluid. In some instances, the well treatment composition may contain between from about 1 to about 99% by weight of conventional proppant.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">The pellets are particularly effective in hydraulic fracturing as well as sand control fluids such as water, salt brine, slickwater such as slick water fracture treatments at relatively low concentrations to achieve partial monolayer fractures, low concentration polymer gel fluids (linear or crosslinked), foams (with gas) fluid, liquid gas such as liquid carbon dioxide fracture treatments for deeper proppant penetration, treatments for water sensitive zones, and treatments for gas storage wells.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\">When used in hydraulic fracturing, the composite may be injected into a subterranean formation in conjunction with a hydraulic fracturing fluid at pressures sufficiently high enough to cause the formation or enlargement of fractures. Since the particulates may withstand temperatures greater than about 370\u00b0 C. and closure stresses greater than about 8000 psi, they may be employed as the proppant particulate. Alternatively, the composite may be employed in conjunction with a conventional proppant. Since the porous particulate of the composite is insoluble, the composite may continue to function as a proppant even after the well treatment agent has been completely leached out of the composite.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">Fluids containing the well treatment composites may be used to optimize hydraulic fracture geometries and enhance well productivity. As an example, the fluids may be used to achieve increased propped fracture length in relatively tight gas formations. Choice of different particulate materials and amounts thereof to employ in such blends may be made based on one or more well treatment considerations including, but not limited to, objective/s of well treatment, such as for sand control and/or for creation of propped fractures, well treatment fluid characteristics, such as apparent specific gravity and/or rheology of carrier fluid, well and formation conditions such as depth of formation, formation porosity/permeability, formation closure stress, type of optimization desired for geometry of downhole-placed particulates such as optimized fracture pack propped length, optimized sand control pack height, optimized fracture pack and/or sand control pack conductivity and combinations thereof. The fracturing fluid, to be used with the composite, exhibits high viscosity, so as to be capable of carrying effective volumes of one or more proppants. It may include aqueous gels and hydrocarbon gels.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">In another embodiment, the well treatment composite may be used to pre-pack a screen for use in gravel packed wells. A screen assembly such as is known in the art may be placed or otherwise disposed within the wellbore so that at least a portion of the screen assembly is disposed adjacent the subterranean formation. In this embodiment, the composite is preferably placed as close to the point of equilibrium as possible in order to ensure the continuous release of the well treatment agent throughout the producing flow stream. A slurry including the composite and a carrier fluid may then be introduced into the wellbore and placed adjacent the subterranean formation by circulation or other suitable method so as to form a fluid-permeable pack in an annular area between the exterior of the screen and the interior of the wellbore that is capable of reducing or substantially preventing the passage of formation particles from the subterranean formation into the wellbore during production of fluids from the formation, while at the same time allowing passage of formation fluids from the subterranean formation through the screen into the wellbore. It is possible that the slurry may contain all or only a portion of the composite; the balance of the slurry may be another material, such as a conventional gravel pack particulate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">Thus, the shaped pellets may be used as a preventative measure by stopping precipitation and deposition of the well treatment agent before it starts. Such alternatives are desired, for instance, when there is a need to increase the amount of the solid well treatment agent that can be placed in gravel packed wells there the amount of proppant or gravel placed in the well is at a minimum. In addition, the well treatment composites in prepacked screens may be used to increase the amount of solid substrate exposed during sand control. When used in sand control, screens prepacked with the well treatment composite may reduce intervention costs for remediation and further increases the effectiveness of the operation. Preferably, however, the screen used is of a size to reduce plugging by formation fines migration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\">As an alternative to use of a screen, the composite may be used in any method in which a pack of particulate material is formed within a wellbore that it is permeable to fluids produced from a wellbore, such as oil, gas, or water, but that substantially prevents or reduces production of formation materials, such as formation sand, from the formation into the wellbore. Such methods may or may not employ a gravel pack screen, may be introduced into a wellbore at pressures below, at or above the fracturing pressure of the formation, such as frac pack, and/or may be employed in conjunction with resins such as sand consolidation resins if so desired.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">The shaped compressed pellets defined herein may further be formed from a composite having a well treatment agent adsorbed onto a water-insoluble adsorbent. The composite may be those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,491,682 and 7,493,955, herein incorporated by reference. In addition, the compressed pellet may contain a weighting agent in order to increase the specific gravity of the pellet.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">The water insoluble adsorbent may be any of various kinds of commercially available high surface area materials having the affinity to adsorb the desired well treatment agent. Typically, the surface area of the adsorbent of the well treating composite is between from about 1 m<sup>2</sup>/g to about 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">Suitable adsorbents include finely divided minerals, fibers, ground almond shells, ground walnut shells, and ground coconut shells. Further suitable water-insoluble adsorbents include activated carbon and/or coals, silica particulates, precipitated silicas, silica (quartz sand), alumina, silica-alumina such as silica gel, mica, silicate, e.g., orthosilicates or metasilicates, calcium silicate, sand (e.g., 20-40 mesh), bauxite, kaolin, talc, zirconia, boron and glass, including glass microspheres or beads, fly ash, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, ground walnut shells, fuller&#39;s earth and organic synthetic high molecular weight water-insoluble adsorbents. Particularly preferred are diatomaceous earth and ground walnut shells.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">Further useful as adsorbents are clays such as natural clays, preferably those having a relatively large negatively charged surface and a much smaller surface that is positively charged. Other examples of such high surface area materials include such clays as bentonite, illite, montmorillonite and synthetic clays.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">The weight ratio of well treatment agent to water-insoluble adsorbent in the composite is generally between from about 90:10 to about 10:90.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">As the oilfield fluid passes through or circulates around the well treatment composites, the well treatment agent slowly desorbs. In so doing, the composites are characterized by time-release capabilities. Gradual desorption of the well treatment agents insures that they are available to produced fluids for extended periods of time, typically extending for periods of time greater than a year and even as long as five years. Thus, the lifetime of a single treatment using the composite may be between 12 months and in excess of 5 years.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\">The amount of well treatment agent in the composite is that amount sufficient to effectuate the desired release into the flowing produced fluid over a sustained period of time. Typically the resulting concentration of the well treatment agent in the wellbore is between from about 1 to about 50 ppm. In some instances, the amount of well treatment agent in the well produced fluid may be as low as 0.1 ppm. Such small amounts of well treatment agents in the produced fluid released from the composite forming the compressed pellet may be sufficient for up to 1,000 pore volumes.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">When placed into a well, the well treatment agent slowly dissolves at a generally constant rate over an extended period of time in the water or hydrocarbons which are contained in the formation and/or well. The composite therefore permits a continuous supply of the well treatment agent into the targeted area.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">The well treatment agent is slowly released from the compressed pellet after being introduced into a targeted area in the well. The targeted area may be a site in the well where deposits have already formed or a location in the well where it is desirable for deposits not to form. The compressed pellets provide a continuous supply of the well treatment agent into the targeted area.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">The pellets have particular applicability in areas within the well where conventional systems have been unable to reach.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">Use of the shaped pellets renders unnecessary the use of burdensome mechanical tools and procedures. While the shaped compressed pellets may be used to treat any type of well that requires chemical treatment, they have particular applicability in the treatment of production wells where traditional mechanical means such as wire lines or coil tubing have been unable to reach. For instance, the shaped pellets may be introduced directly into production tubing by being dropped directly into the well head or may be placed in a receptacle and lowered into the well.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">When introduced into production tubing within the well, the shape and specific gravity of the pellets causes the particulates to flow past obstructions and through well deviations such that the pellets may be placed at or in close proximity to the targeted area where treatment is desired. Continuous release of the well treatment agent with the production fluid further protects the tubular and the surface equipment from unwanted deposits which may otherwise be formed. Production from the well is thereby improved.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">Similar performance has been seen in producing wells where the shaped pellets are used simply to deploy production chemicals, particularly in horizontal wells where capillary deployment is not possible to the toe of the horizontal section of the well or where squeeze treatments are impractical; for example, in wells which have not been stimulated.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">The shaped pellets may be dropped directly into the well from the well head. When introduced into production tubing within an oil or gas well, the shaped pellets easily flow past obstructions and through well deviations. Continuous release of the well treatment agent with the production fluid protects the tubular and the surface equipment from unwanted deposits which may be formed in the tubular or surface equipment. The high specific gravity of the shaped pellets allows them to pass by gravity into and through production tubing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">The shaped pellets are especially useful when introduced into horizontal or deviated wells since they easily pass through restrictions in the wellbore and flow into low points of the horizontal well or past obstruction in a deviated well.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">When shaped as spheres, the pellets are able to readily roll over obstructions within the tubing and thru well deviations to effectively place the well treatment agent in close proximity to the targeted area. The spheres are especially useful in delivering well treatment agents in wells having deviations ranging from 45\u00b0 to 89\u00b0 or in wells with multiple deviations such as \u201cS\u201d shaped completions.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">When formed to resemble hockey pucks, the shaped pellets may be placed into a receptacle and suspended at distant locations within the well. When the well treatment agent is depleted within the receptacle, the receptacle may then be pulled to the surface and reloaded with additional pellets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">The shaped pellets may be in the form of a sphere, cylinder, rod or any other shape which allows for the slow release of the well treatment agent into the targeted area. In some applications, the shaped pellets are cylindrically shaped having a length of about 0.5 inch to about 6 inches, preferably from about 1 inch to about 2 inches and a diameter of from about 0.25 inch to about 4 inches, preferably from about 0.5 inch to about 1 inch.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">In those instances where the shaped pellet is to be directly dropped into the well from the well head, the pellet is preferably spherical and is formed into a ball-like sphere having a diameter between from about \u00bd inch to about 3 inches, more preferably from about \u00be inch to about 2\u00bd A inches, most preferably approximately 1\u00be inch. Such spheres resemble spherical balls.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">The specific gravity of the shaped pellets is generally between from about 1.1 to about 3. In a preferred embodiment, the specific gravity of the sphere is between from about 2 to about 2.5.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">Such specific gravity is especially desirable when the shaped pellets are spherical and where it is desired to drop the pellet directly into the well head. When used as one or more spherical balls, the pellets may be introduced into the well above the master valve at the wellhead. The isolation valve above the spherical ball(s) may then be closed and the master valve then opened. Gravitational forces will pull the ball(s) into the production tubing. The low specific gravity allows the sphere(s) to fall by gravitational forces through the production tubing. The combination of gravitational forces, specific gravity of the ball(s), sphericity of the ball(s) and size then allow the ball(s) to fall, sink or roll down the tubing and pass through restrictions in the wellbore. When introduced into a horizontal well, the spherical ball(s) will generally flow into the lowest point of the well. When introduced into a deviated well, the spherical pellets easily may flow past obstructions as they are pulled by gravity through the deviations in the well path where traditional mechanical means such as wire line or coil tubing may not be able to reach. The shaped pellets have applicability when used during completion of a well having multiple deviations such as those wells having an \u201cS\u201d shaped configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">Once the spherical ball(s) reach their targeted area, they will slowly dissolve, providing a residual of the well treatment agent in produced fluids. Thus, the slow dissolution of the ball(s) provides the means to inhibit and/or remove unwanted deposits in the tubing.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">When dropped directly into the well head, it is often only necessary to use one spherical ball. Typically, no more than ten spherical balls need be used to effectuate the slow release of the well treatment agent. Slow dissolution of the spherical balls permits slow dissolution of the well treatment agent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">The shaped pellets further are useful in gas wells having a tubing pressure of from about 1 to about 10,000 psi. Exemplary of such wells are shale gas wells. Further the spherical particulates have applicability in unobstructed tubulars. For instance, the spherical pellets are useful in those wells where the hydrocarbons are no longer freely flowing, such as wells on bottom hole electric submersible pumps (ESP).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the shaped pellets may be simply lowered into the well. For instance, the particulates may be placed into a receptacle, such as a wire basket, and suspended at the bottom of the well by various means, such as by a wireline or by being hung to the bottom of a rod pump. When the particulates are depleted of the well treatment agent, the wire basket may then be pulled to the surface and reloaded with additional particulates for further treatment</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">In another embodiment, the pellet may be placed into a receptacle and the receptacle then affixed to the bottom of a bottom hole electric submersible pump by hanging the receptacle from the bottom of the bottom hole electric submersible pump. The bottom hole electric submersible pump with the affixed receptacle may then be lowered into the well.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">The shaped compressed pellet may be used in completion or production services. The shaped compressed pellet may be used in the well to remove undesired contaminants from or control the formation of undesired contaminants onto tubular surface equipment within the wellbore</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">The well treatment agent is preferably a liquid material. If the well treatment agent is a solid, it can be dissolved in a suitable solvent, thus making it a liquid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">The well treatment agent is preferably water soluble or soluble in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. In a preferred embodiment, the well treatment agent may be at least one member selected from the group consisting of demulsifying agents (both water-in-oil or oil-in-water), corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, paraffin inhibitors, gas hydrate inhibitors, salt formation inhibitors, asphaltene dispersants, foaming agents, oxygen scavengers, hydrogen sulfide scavengers, water soluble tracers, oil soluble traders, biocides and surfactants as well as other agents wherein slow release into the production well is desired.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">When fluid is produced, the well treatment agent may desorb into its respective solubilizing liquid. For instance, where a solid well treatment is an inhibitor for scales, corrosion, salts or biocidal action, the treatment agent may desorb into produced water. In the absence of water flow, the well treatment agent may remain intact on the solid adsorbent. As another example, solid inhibitors for paraffin or asphaltene may desorb into the hydrocarbon phase of produced fluid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">The shaped pellets of the invention may be employed with carrier or treatment fluids in order to facilitate placement of the composite to a desired location within the formation. In this regard, any carrier fluid suitable for transporting the composite may be used. Well treatment compositions containing the composite may be gelled or non-gelled. In one embodiment, the well treatment composites described herein may be introduced or pumped into a well as neutrally buoyant particles in, for example, a saturated sodium chloride solution carrier fluid or a carrier fluid that is any other completion or workover brine known in the art. Suitable carrier fluids include or may be used in combination with fluids have gelling agents, cross-linking agents, gel breakers, surfactants, foaming agents, demulsifiers, buffers, clay stabilizers, acids, or mixtures thereof. The shaped compressed pellets may further be advantageously employed in liquefied gas and foamed gas carrier fluids, such as liquid CO2, CO2/N2, and foamed N2 in CO2 based systems.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">The carrier fluid may be a brine (such as a saturated potassium chloride or sodium chloride solution), salt water, fresh water, a liquid hydrocarbon, or a gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The amount of composite present in the well treating composition is typically between from about 15 ppm to about 100,000 ppm depending upon the severity of the scale deposition. Suitable compositions include fracturing fluids, completion fluids, acidizing compositions, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the shaped compressed pellets are used in wells in order inhibit the formation of scales, control the formation of scales or retard the release of scale inhibitors into the well. Suitable scale inhibitors are those which are efficacious in the treatment of scales of calcium, barium, magnesium salts and the like, including barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate scales as well as inorganic scales, such as zinc sulfide, iron sulfide, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">Suitable scale inhibitors are anionic scale inhibitors.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">Exemplary scale inhibitors are strong acidic materials such as a phosphonic acid, a phosphoric acid or a phosphorous acid, phosphate esters, phosphonate/phosphonic acids, the various aminopoly carboxylic acids, chelating agents, and polymeric inhibitors and salts thereof thereof. Included are organo phosphonates, organo phosphates and phosphate esters as well as the corresponding acids and salts thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">Phosphonate/phosphonic acid type scale inhibitors are often preferred in light of their effectiveness to control scales at relatively low concentration. Polymeric scale inhibitors, such as polyacrylamides, salts of acrylamido-methyl propane sulfonate/acrylic acid copolymer (AMPS/AA), salts of sulfonated co-polymer (VS-Co), phosphinated maleic copolymer (PHOS/MA) or sodium salt of polymaleic acid/acrylic acid/acrylamido-methyl propane sulfonate terpolymers (PMA/AMPS), are also effective scale inhibitors. Sodium salts are preferred.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">Further useful, especially for brines, are chelating agents, including diethylenetriaminepentamethylene phosphonic acid and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">Further preferred as scale removal agents are inorganic and organic strong acids such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and formic acid. Caustic scale removal agents may be employed to remove sulfate scales and may include sodium hydroxide, chelants such as EDTA, glucoheptonate, and urea.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">The well treatment agent may further be any of the fructans or fructan derivatives, such as inulin and inulin derivatives, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0325825, herein incorporated by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">Exemplary of the demulsifying agents that are useful include, but are not limited to, condensation polymers of alkylene oxides and glycols, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide condensation polymers of di-propylene glycol as well as trimethylol propane; and alkyl substituted phenol formaldehyde resins, bis-phenyl diepoxides, and esters and diesters of the such di-functional products. Especially preferred as non-ionic demulsifiers are oxyalkylated phenol formaldehyde resins, oxyalkylated amines and polyamines, di-epoxidized oxyalkylated polyethers, etc. Suitable oil-in-water demulsifiers include poly triethanolamine methyl chloride quaternary, melamine acid colloid, aminomethylated polyacrylamide etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">Paraffin inhibitors useful as the well treatment agent include, but are not limited to, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, acrylates (such as polyacrylate esters and methacrylate esters of fatty alcohols), and olefin/maleic esters.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">Exemplary corrosion inhibitors useful for the practice of the invention include but are not limited to fatty imidazolines, alkyl pyridines, alkyl pyridine quaternaries, fatty amine quaternaries and phosphate salts of fatty imidazolines.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">Gas hydrate treating chemicals or inhibitors that are useful for the practice of the present invention include but are not limited to polymers and homopolymers and copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl caprolactam and amine based hydrate inhibitors such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2006/0223713 and 2009/0325823, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">Exemplary asphaltene treating chemicals include but are not limited to fatty ester homopolymers and copolymers (such as fatty esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid polymers and copolymers) and sorbitan monooleate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0097\">Suitable tracers include dyes (such as phenoxazone dyes, fluroescein, pyridinium betaines dyes, solvatochromatic dyes, Oregon Green, Cascade Blue, Lucifer yellow, Auramine O, tetramethylrhodamine, pysranine, sulforhodamines, hydroxycoumarins; polysulfonated pyrenes; cyanines, hydroxylamines, neutral red, acridine orange; acids (such as picric acid and salicylic acid) or salts thereof; ionizable compounds (such as those which provide ammonium, boron, chromate, etc., ions); and radioactive materials (such as krypton-85); isotopes; genetically or biologically coded materials; microorganisms; minerals; and high molecular weight synthetic and natural compounds and polymers (such as oligonucleotides, perfluorinated hydrocarbons like perfluoro butane, perfluoro methyl cyclopentane and perfluoro methyl cyclohexane).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0098\">The tracer may also be a chelate, such as ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)) or a salt thereof. U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,329, herein incorporated by reference, discloses acceptable metal chelates formed by reacting aryl substituted ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid and a metal ion selected from the consisting of lead, cadmium and zinc. Such chelates react with fluorogenic agents, such as fluorescamine and o-phthalaldehyde. Fluorescence spectroscopy is then used to detect the chelate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0099\">The hydrogen sulfide scavenger may be an oxidant, such as an inorganic peroxide, e.g. sodium peroxide, or chlorine dioxide, or an aldehyde, e.g. of 1 to 10 carbons such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde or (meth)acrolein or an amine based scavenger, such as a triazine or a hexamine.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0100\">Suitable foaming agents include, but are not limited to, those which are amphoteric, anionic or cationic. Preferred anionic foaming agents include betaines, alkyl ether sulfates, oxyalkylated sulfates, alkoxylated alcohol sulfates, phosphate esters, alkyl ether phosphates, alkoxylated alcohol phosphate esters, alkyl sulfates as well as alpha olefin sulfonates. Included as amphoteric surfactants are glycinates, amphoacetates, propionates, betaines and mixtures thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0101\">Exemplary surfactants include cationic, amphoteric, anionic and nonionic surfactants. Included as cationic surfactants are those containing a quaternary ammonium moiety (such as a linear quaternary amine, a benzyl quaternary amine or a quaternary ammonium halide), a quaternary sulfonium moiety or a quaternary phosphonium moiety or mixtures thereof. Suitable surfactants containing a quaternary group include quaternary ammonium halide or quaternary amine, such as quaternary ammonium chloride or a quaternary ammonium bromide. Included as amphoteric surfactants are glycinates, amphoacetates, propionates, betaines and mixtures thereof. The cationic or amphoteric surfactant may have a hydrophobic tail (which may be saturated or unsaturated) such as a C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>carbon chain length. Further, the hydrophobic tail may be obtained from a natural oil from plants such as one or more of coconut oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0102\">Preferred surfactants include N,N,N trimethyl-1-octadecammonium chloride: N,N,N trimethyl-1-hexadecammonium chloride; and N,N,N trimethyl-1-soyaammonium chloride, and mixtures thereof. Suitable anionic surfactants are sulfonates (like sodium xylene sulfonate and sodium naphthalene sulfonate), phosphonates, ethoxysulfates and mixtures thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0103\">Exemplary oxygen scavengers include triazines, maleimides, formaldehydes, amines, carboxamides, alkylcarboxyl-azo compounds cumine-peroxide compounds morpholino and amino derivatives morpholine and piperazine derivatives, amine oxides, alkanolamines, aliphatic and aromatic polyamines.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0104\">The binder, to which the composite is added, generally serves to hold the well treatment agent and any desired additives agents together during compression. Suitable binders may be an organic binder or inorganic binder. Typical organic binders are those selected from resole or novolac resins, such as phenolic resole or novolac resins, epoxy-modified novolac resins, epoxy resins, polyurethane resins, alkaline modified phenolic resoles curable with an ester, melamine resins, urea-aldehyde resins, urea-phenol-aldehyde resins, furans, synthetic rubbers, silanes, siloxanes, polyisocyanates, polyepoxys, polymethylmethacrylates, methyl celluloses, crosslink entangled polystyrene divinylbenzenes, and plastics of such polymers as polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, polyolefins, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylacetates, silyl-modified polyamides and, optionally, a crosslinking agent. Typical inorganic binders include silicates, e.g., sodium silicate, aluminosilicates, phosphates, e.g., polyphosphate glass, borates, or mixtures thereof, e.g., silicate and phosphate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0105\">The amount of binder added to the composite to form the compressed pellet is typically from about 0.5 to about 50, preferably from about 1 to about 5 percent based on the total weight of the binder and composite, prior to compression.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0106\">Prior to being shaped, a weighting agent may be combined with the composite and binder in order to impart to the shaped pellet a higher specific gravity. When present, the amount of weighting agent added to the composite is that amount needed to adjust the specific gravity of the shaped particulate to the requirements of the treated well. Suitable weighting agents include sand, glass, hematite, silica, sand, aluminosilicate, and an alkali metal salt or trimanganese tetraoxide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0107\">The shaped particulates may be produced by procedures known in the art. Typically the shaped particulates are formed by combining the well treatment composite and, optional, weighting agent, with a binder and then compressing the mixture in a mold of the desired shape or extruding the mixture into its desired shape.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0108\">Exemplary of the process for making the shaped particulates is to combine the composite, prepared in accordance with the teachings set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955 or 7,494,711, with an organic binder and then compressing the mixture at a temperature between from about 20\u00b0 C. to about 50\u00b0 C. at a pressure of from between 50 to about 5000 psi. The hardened particulates may then be screened to the desired size and shape. In another preferred embodiment, the shaped composites are produced by a continuous extrusion at a temperature between from about 400\u00b0 C. to about and 800\u00b0 C.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0109\">The shaped particulates may further be coated with a resin, plastic or sealant which is resistant to the hydrocarbons produced in the well. Suitable resins include phenolic resins like phenol formaldehyde resins, melamine formaldehyde resins, urethane resins, epoxy resins, polyamides, such as nylon, polyethylene, polystyrene, furan resins or a combination thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0110\">The coating layer serves to strengthen the compressed pellet, protect the pellet from harsh environmental conditions, protect the pellet from rupturing as it is lowered into the well and to lengthen the time of release of the well treatment agent from the pellet. The coating layer may be applied to the pellet by mixing the pellet and coating material in a vessel at elevated temperatures, typically from about 200 to about 350, preferably around 250\u00b0 F. An adherent, such as a resin adhesive or tackifying resin, may further be added to the vessel during mixing. The adherent may be used to assist the adhesion of the coating onto the compressed pellet. Alternatively, the coating layer may also be applied as a spray in a solvent based coating on the compressed pellet and then dried to remove the solvent.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0111\">Adsorption of the well treatment agent onto the adsorbent reduces (or eliminates) the amount of well treatment agent required to be in solution. Since the well treatment agent is adsorbent onto a substrate, only a small amount of well treatment agent may be released into the aqueous medium.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0112\">In another embodiment, the calcined porous metal oxide of the composite may be reactivated or recharged with the well treatment agent after at least a portion of the well treatment agent has been depleted. Such processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,686,081 and U.S. Patent Publication no. 2010/0175875, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0113\">In this procedure, an initial charge of the composite may be injected into the well bore in a conventional method, whether for fracturing or for gravel packing. Such conventional methods include truck treating, continuous injection, or high pressure pumping, for example. The downhole matrix formed within the formation after the initial charge is comprised of the well treatment agent on a water-insoluble adsorbent as part of the sand matrix.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0114\">Additional amounts of fluid containing the well treatment agent may be injected into the formation anytime after the initial charge of well treatment agent in the composite has at least partially depleted. Typically, the additional well treatment agent is introduced when the well treatment agent adsorbed onto the adsorbent or within the interstitial spaces of the composite has been substantially depleted and the performance level of the well treatment agent in the composite has become unacceptable.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0115\">The injection of additional well treatment agent may be carried out in the same manner by which the initial composite was charged into the wellbore, and can be carried out in any conventional method of injecting fluids into a wellbore of an oil or gas well, as mentioned above. The fluid which is injected will typically be comprised of the desired well treatment agent(s) in a solution which further comprises a solvent. The relative amounts of the solvent and treatment agent of the solution to be injected into the wellbore will of course vary depending upon the agent and solvent involved, but will typically be of a solvent to treatment agent ratio in the range of about 10:90 to about 95:5, by weight. The solvent in one embodiment is xylene, toluene, or a heavy aromatic distillate or a mixture thereof. When a mixture of all of xylene, toluene and heavy aromatic distillate is used, the relative amounts of each solvent component can vary, but will be typically in variable weight ratios (xylene:toluene:heavy aromatic distillate) such as 10:70:20, 20:70:10, 70:20:10 or 20:10:70. In another embodiment, the solvent can be water (for water soluble well treatment agents).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0116\">After the injection step is carried out, the wellbore is pressurized for a time and under conditions sufficient to reactivate the downhole matrix in the formation. This pressurization of material in the wellbore and formation fracture is commonly referred to as a \u201csqueeze.\u201d Reactivation of the treatment agent downhole may occur through the squeeze process as long as the activity of the treatment agent in the in-place matrix is increased relative to the treatment agent activity of the matrix just prior to injecting the solution. The determination of whether the treatment agent activity has increased relative to the activity of that agent just prior to injection of the solution and completion of the squeeze may be made through conventional residual analysis and comparison of the same before and after the squeeze, and conventional analysis of the physical well parameters, e.g., the production rate of the well and well pressure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0117\">The pressure to which the wellbore is pressurized in the squeeze process typically will be a pressure below the fracturing pressure, and when applicable, below the pressure that would cause the gravel pack to break up. In one embodiment of the invention, the pressure is in a range of about 500 to about 15000 psia. The duration for which the pressure condition is applied to the well will vary, depending upon the ease of fracturing, but will typically be in the range of about 2 to about 10 hours.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0118\">The following examples are illustrative of some of the embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments within the scope of the claims herein will be apparent to one skilled in the art from consideration of the description set forth herein.

from ThermPhos International BV was adsorbed onto each of Sample A, Sample B and Sample C to render Samples FBG-90706-4A, FBG-90706-4B and FBG-90706-4C respectively. These Samples were prepared by first adsorbing water on the Samples to determine how much water could be adsorbed. Water was added to the sample until the Sample appeared wet. Sample A was found to adsorb 0.698 g of H2O/g of sample, Sample B adsorbed 0.362 g of H2O/g of sample, and Sample C adsorbed 0.415 g of H2O/g of sample. Next Dequest 2000 was added to each sample. Due to the low adsorbency compared to diatomaceous earth, two additions were followed to prepare the samples. In the first addition for Sample A, only 0.32 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample A could be added. In the second addition, 0.25 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample A could be added. This results in a product which contains about 22% active content. The method used to prepare the diatomaceous earth based product set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955 was adapted to these alumina samples. For Sample B, only 0.31 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample B could be added followed by 0.13 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample B in the second addition. This results in a product which contains about 18% active content. For Sample C, only 0.23 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample C could be added followed by 0.08 g of Dequest 2000/g of Sample C in the second addition. This results in a product which contains about 13.5% active content.

elution characteristic of the solid composites of Example 3 were determined by packing 20/40-mesh Ottawa sand and solid inhibitor (2% by weight of the sand) into a 35-cm-long stainless steel column (inner diameter=1.08 cm). The pore volume was approximately 12 mL. The column was eluted with synthetic brine (0.025 mol/L CaCl2, 0.015 mol/L NaHCO3, 1 mol/L NaCl, sparged with 100% CO2) at 60\u00b0 with a flow rate of 120 mL/hour. The synthetic brine was at saturation with calcite to simulate typical connate brine in the formation. The effluent solution was collected and analyzed for phosphorus and Ca concentration to obtain the inhibitor release profile. The results are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1B</figref>.

<heading id=\"h-0015\">Example 9</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0131\">The elution of each of samples of Example 8 was performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Examples 4 and 6 with 50% of the particles by weight of the sand in the column. The results are set forth in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4B</figref> and are compared to the results of 2% of loading of the composite exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 7,493,955. The results are similar to those of Example 6 and show that the amount of composite may be tailored with the amount of proppant depending on the amount of water produced from the well and how long protection is desired. As illustrated, 2% of the particles in the sand and 50% particles in the sand may be used for the same purpose.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0016\">Example 10</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0132\">About 800 g of 10/50 mesh diatomaceous earth (Celite MP-79) absorbent was added into a mixing bowl. A paddle mixer blade was attached and liquid organophosphate (Solutia Dequest 2000) was added to the mixing bowl at a rate in which the liquid was readily absorbed, and the liquid did not puddle. After all of the liquid was added, mixing was continued until a homogenous blend was produced. The blend was then dried at 225 F until the percent moisture of the resulting product was less than 3%. The composite thus prepared contained 25 percent by weight of organophosphate scale inhibitor. To the composite was then added a binder of an epoxy resin (A), phenolic resin (B) and polyvinyl alcohol (C). The mixture contained about 50 percent by weight of the resin. The mixture was then compressed under a pressure of about 250 psi for about 1 minute in a mold to render a cylindrical pellet resembling a hockey puck having a diameter of about 1 inch and a thickness of about 0.5 inch to render puck (A), (B) and (C) corresponding to the epoxy resin binder, phenolic resin binder and polyvinyl alcohol binder, respectively. Puck (D) was obtained by coating Puck (C) with an epoxy resin by spray and drying.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0017\">Example 11</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0133\">The elution characteristics of Puck C and Puck D were then determined by packing approximately 440 grams 20/40 Ottawa white frac sand and 3 pieces of the pucks into a 30 cm length stainless steel column (ID=3.48 cm). The pore volume of the column was approximately 80 milliliters. The column was eluted with a synthetic brine (0.025 mol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.015 mol/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mol/L NaCl, sparged with 100% CO<sub>2</sub>) at 60\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of 270 ml/hour. The effluent solution was collected and analyzed for phosphorus and calcium concentration to obtain the inhibitor flow back curve, set forth in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent gradually decreased as synthetic brine was pumped into the column. After 1200 pore volumes of return flow, the concentration of effluent phosphorus remained approximately 0.4 ppm. There was no significant difference found between the phosphorus return curves of Puck (C) and Puck (D). The data demonstrates the ease that the pucks have while flowing through production tubing.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0018\">Example 12</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0134\">Puck (A) and Puck (B) were mixed with 500 ml of water. After 30 minutes, the supernatant was removed and the concentration of phosphorus in the supernatant was measured by (ICP) spectrophotometer. The test was repeated 14 times. The amount of residual phosphorous in the supernatant, illustrated as the static breaker test, is illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> demonstrates that the concentration of phosphorus in the effluent concentration of Puck (B) was higher than that of sample Puck (A) after washing with tap water.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0019\">Example 13</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0135\">To about 95% by weight of the composite of Example 5 was added about 5% by weight of a high melting polyethylene wax. The mixture was then compressed into a pellet having a diameter of 1 inch and about half inch in height to obtain Puck (E). Puck (F) was obtained by coating the compressed pellet of Puck (E) with about 20 weight % epoxy resin and drying the coated resin at 120\u00b0 F. Puck (E) and Puck (F) were then immersed in water at 180\u00b0 F. for five days. No deterioration was seen in either puck after 5 days. Puck (E) and Puck (F) were also immersed in W. Texas Crude Oil for two weeks at 140\u00b0 F. No deterioration was seen in either puck after two weeks. Elution studies were then conducted on Puck (E) and Puck (F) in accordance with the testing conditions of Example 11. <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> represents the inhibitor flow back curve of Puck (E) and Puck (F). The results indicate the release of scale inhibitor above the minimum effective inhibitor concentration of 0.1 mg/l even after 1500 pore volumes of fluid elution through the column when the testing was terminated. The results of the release curve for the coated Puck (F) indicate no premature release of the inhibitor at the beginning which should result in longer effectiveness of the puck.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0136\">From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the invention.</p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Field of the Invention \\n     The present invention generally relates to recombinant host organisms (e.g., plants) genetically modified with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase system and one or more accessory proteins that allow for and/or improve the production of PUFAs in the host organism. The present invention also relates to methods of making and using such organisms (e.g., to obtain PUFAs) as well as products obtained from such organisms (e.g., oil and seed). \\n     2. Background Art \\n     Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are considered to be useful for nutritional applications, pharmaceutical applications, industrial applications, and other purposes. However, the current supply of PUFAs from natural sources (e.g., fish oils) and from chemical synthesis is not sufficient for long-term commercial needs. \\n     Vegetable oils derived from plants (e.g., oil seed crops) are relatively inexpensive and do not have the contamination issues associated with fish oils. However, the PUFAs found in commercially-developed plants and plant oils do not typically include more saturated or longer-chain PUFAs, and only typically include fatty acids such as linoleic acid (eighteen carbons with 2 double bonds, in the delta 9 and 12 positions\u201418:2 delta 9,12) and linolenic acid (18:3 delta 9,12,15). \\n     The production of more unsaturated or longer-chain PUFAs in plants by the modification of the fatty acids endogenously produced by plants has been described. For example, the genetic modification of plants with various individual genes encoding fatty acid elongases and/or desaturases has been described as resulting in the generation of leaves or seeds containing significant levels of longer-chain and more unsaturated PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but also containing significant levels of mixed shorter-chain and less unsaturated PUFAs (Qi et al., Nature Biotech. 22:739 (2004); WO 04/071467; Abbadi et al., Plant Cell 16:1 (2004); Napier and Sayanova, Proceedings of the Nutrition Society 64:387-393 (2005); Robert et al., Functional Plant Biology 32:473-479 (2005); U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682, U.S. Appl. No. 61/345,537, filed May 17, 2010). \\n     Fabaceae (or Leguminosae) is a large and economically important family of flowering plants, which is commonly known as the legume family, pea family, bean family or pulse family.  Glycine  is a genus in the family Fabaceae and includes, for example,  Glycine  albicans,  Glycine aphyonota, Glycine arenari, Glycine argyrea, Glycine canescens, Glycine clandestine, Glycine curvata, Glycine cyrtoloba, Glycine falcate, Glycine gracei, Glycine hirticaulis, Glycine hirticaulis  subsp.  leptosa, Glycine lactovirens, Glycine latifolia, Glycine latrobeana, Glycine microphylla, Glycine montis - douglas, Glycine peratosa, Glycine pescadrensis, Glycine pindanica, Glycine pullenii, Glycine rubiginosa, Glycine stenophita, Glycine syndetika, Glycine tabacina, Glycine tomentella, Glycine soja , and  Glycine max  (soybean). The family Fabaceae also includes peanut, beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), broad beans ( Vicia faba ) or peas ( Pisum sativum ). \\n     The majority of soybean oil is in the form of vegetable oils produced for human consumption. There is also a growing market for the use of soybean oil in industrial applications. \\n     BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     There is a need in the art for a relatively inexpensive method to efficiently and effectively produce quantities (e.g., commercial quantities) of longer-chain or more unsaturated PUFAs in plants, plant seed or plant oil, as well as quantities of lipids (e.g., triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid (PL)) enriched in such PUFAs in plants, plant seed or plant oil. A system for providing and improving PUFA production in host organisms (e.g., plants) by providing recombinant host organisms genetically modified with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase and one or more accessory proteins, as described herein, is a significant alternative to the approaches in the art. \\n     The present invention is directed to genetically modified plants (e.g., plants of the family Fabaceae or the genus  Glycine  such as soybean), descendants, seeds, cells, tissues, or parts thereof, comprising (i) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase (e.g., an algal PUFA synthase) that produces at least one PUFA; and (ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that transfers a phosphopantetheinyl cofactor to an PUFA synthase system (e.g., an algal PUFA synthase system) ACP domain. \\n     In some embodiments of the present invention, the PUFA synthase comprises an amino acid sequence that is 80% to 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.

LC-PUFAs also include fatty acids with greater than 22 carbons and 4 or more double bonds including but not limited to C28:8(n-3). \\n     The term \u201cPUFA synthase\u201d as used herein refers to an enzyme that produces polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and particularly, long chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs) as well as any domain of such an enzyme in a complex. The teen PUFA synthase includes, but is not limited to, PUFA PKS systems or PKS-like systems for the production of PUFAs. Some specific PUFA synthases are designated herein by an additional notation, e.g., \u201cSzPUFA\u201d synthase or \u201chSzThPUFA\u201d synthase, as defined in the application. The term \u201cPUFA synthase system\u201d includes a PUFA synthase and any accessory enzymes that can affect the function of the PUFA synthase when expressed in a heterologous organism (e.g., a PPTase or ACS). \\n     The terms \u201cphosphopantetheinyl transferase\u201d and \u201cPPTase\u201d as used herein refer to an enzyme that activates a PUFA synthase by transferring a cofactor (e.g., 4-phosphopantetheine) from coenzyme A (CoA) to one or more ACP domains present in the PUFA synthase. One example of a PPTase that can activate one or more ACP domains of a PUFA synthase described herein is the Het I protein of  Nostoc  sp. PCC 7120 (formerly called  Anabaena  sp. PCC 7120), designated herein as \u201cNoHetI.\u201d \\n     The terms \u201cacyl-CoA synthetase,\u201d \u201cACoAS\u201d and \u201cACS\u201d as used herein refer to an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of long chain polyunsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl-CoA. Some specific acyl-CoA synthetases are designated herein by an additional notation, e.g., \u201cSzACS-2,\u201d as defined in the application. \\n     The term \u201cplant\u201d as used herein includes any descendant, cell, tissue, seed, seed oil, or part thereof. \\n     \u201cNutraceutical\u201d means a product isolated, purified, concentrated, or produced from plants that provides a physiological benefit or provides protection against disease, including processed foods supplemented with such products, along with foods produced from crops that have been genetically engineered to contain enhanced levels of such physiologically-active components. \\n     \u201cFunctional food\u201d means a food that (a) is similar in appearance to or can be a conventional food that is consumed as part of a usual diet and (b) has enhanced nutritional value and/or specific dietary benefits based on a modification in the proportion of components that typically exist in the unmodified food. \\n     The terms \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and \u201cnucleic acid\u201d are intended to encompass a singular nucleic acid as well as plural nucleic acids, a nucleic acid molecule or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, or construct, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA) or plasmid DNA (pDNA). A polynucleotide or nucleic acid can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA sequence, or a fragment thereof, including the untranslated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences and the coding sequences. A polynucleotide or nucleic acid can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which can be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, a polynucleotide or nucleic acid can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that can be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. These terms also embrace chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms of a polynucleotide or nucleic acid. \\n     A polynucleotide or nucleic acid sequence can be referred to as \u201cisolated\u201d in which it has been removed from its native environment. For example, a heterologous polynucleotide or nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment having dihydroxy-acid dehydratase activity contained in a vector is considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or a purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotide or nucleic acid in solution. An isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid according to the present invention further includes such molecules produced synthetically. An isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid in the form of a polymer of DNA can be comprised of one or more segments of cDNA, genomic DNA or synthetic DNA. \\n     The term \u201cgene\u201d refers to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof that is capable of being expressed as a specific protein, optionally including regulatory sequences preceding (5\u2032 non-coding sequences) and following (3\u2032 non-coding sequences) the coding sequence. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201ccoding region\u201d refers to a DNA sequence that codes for a specific amino acid sequence. \u201cSuitable regulatory sequences\u201d refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5\u2032 non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3\u2032 non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence and that influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences can include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, polyadenylation recognition sequences, RNA processing site, effector binding site, and stem-loop structure. \\n     As used herein, the terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is intended to encompass a singular \u201cpolypeptide\u201d as well as plural \u201cpolypeptides\u201d and fragments thereof, and refers to a molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide bonds (also known as peptide bonds). The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to any chain or chains of two or more amino acids, and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides, protein, amino acid chain, or any other term used to refer to a chain or chains of two or more amino acids, are included within the definition of \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d and the term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d can be used instead of, or interchangeably with any of these terms. A polypeptide can be derived from a natural biological source or produced by recombinant technology, but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It can be generated in any manner, including by chemical synthesis. \\n     By an \u201cisolated\u201d polypeptide or a fragment, variant, or derivative thereof is intended a polypeptide that is not in its natural milieu. No particular level of purification is required. For example, an isolated polypeptide can be removed from its native or natural environment. Recombinantly produced polypeptides and proteins expressed in host cells are considered isolated for purposes of the invention, as are native or recombinant polypeptides that have been separated, fractionated, or partially or substantially purified by any suitable technique. \\n     As used herein, \u201cnative\u201d refers to the form of a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide as found in nature with its own regulatory sequences, if present. \\n     As used herein, \u201cendogenous\u201d refers to the native form of a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide in its natural location in the organism or in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous polynucleotide\u201d includes a native polynucleotide in its natural location in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous gene\u201d includes a native gene in its natural location in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous polypeptide\u201d includes a native polypeptide in its natural location in the organism. \\n     As used herein, \u201cheterologous\u201d refers to a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide not normally found in the host organism but that is introduced into the host organism. \u201cHeterologous polynucleotide\u201d includes a native coding region, or portion thereof, that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native polynucleotide. \u201cHeterologous gene\u201d includes a native coding region, or portion thereof, that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native gene. For example, a heterologous gene can include a native coding region that is a portion of a chimeric gene including non-native regulatory regions that is reintroduced into the native host. \u201cHeterologous polypeptide\u201d includes a native polypeptide that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native polypeptide. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201cmodification\u201d refers to a change in a polynucleotide disclosed herein that results in reduced, substantially eliminated or eliminated activity of a polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide, as well as a change in a polypeptide disclosed herein that results in reduced, substantially eliminated or eliminated activity of the polypeptide. Such changes can be made by methods well known in the art, including, but not limited to, deleting, mutating (e.g., spontaneous mutagenesis, random mutagenesis, mutagenesis caused by mutator genes, or transposon mutagenesis), substituting, inserting, down-regulating, altering the cellular location, altering the state of the polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g., methylation, phosphorylation or ubiquitination), removing a cofactor, introduction of an antisense RNA/DNA, introduction of an interfering RNA/DNA, chemical modification, covalent modification, irradiation with UV or X-rays, homologous recombination, mitotic recombination, promoter replacement methods, and/or combinations thereof. Guidance in determining which nucleotides or amino acid residues can be modified, can be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polynucleotide or polypeptide with that of homologous polynucleotides or polypeptides, e.g., yeast or bacterial, and maximizing the number of modifications made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or consensus sequences. \\n     The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein, refers to a modification of a sequence disclosed in the present invention. Illustrative of such modifications would be the substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of one or more bases relating to a nucleic acid sequence of a coding sequence disclosed herein that preserve, slightly alter, or increase the function of a coding sequence disclosed herein in oil seed crop species. Such derivatives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, for example, using computer modeling techniques for predicting and optimizing sequence structure. The term \u201cderivative\u201d thus also includes nucleic acid sequences having substantial sequence homology with the disclosed coding sequences herein such that they are able to have the disclosed functionalities for use in producing LC-PUFAs of the present invention. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201cvariant\u201d refers to a polypeptide differing from a specifically recited polypeptide of the invention by amino acid insertions, deletions, mutations, and substitutions, created using, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, such as mutagenesis. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be replaced, added, or deleted without abolishing activities of interest, can be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polypeptide with that of homologous polypeptides and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or by replacing amino acids with consensus sequences. \\n     Alternatively, recombinant polynucleotide variants encoding these same or similar polypeptides can be synthesized or selected by making use of the \u201credundancy\u201d in the genetic code. Various codon substitutions, such as silent changes that produce various restriction sites, can be introduced to optimize cloning into a plasmid or viral vector for expression. Mutations in the polynucleotide sequence can be reflected in the polypeptide or domains of other peptides added to the polypeptide to modify the properties of any part of the polypeptide. \\n     Amino acid \u201csubstitutions\u201d can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements, or they can be the result of replacing one amino acid with an amino acid having different structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., non-conservative amino acid replacements. \u201cConservative\u201d amino acid substitutions can be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Alternatively, \u201cnon-conservative\u201d amino acid substitutions can be made by selecting the differences in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, or the amphipathic nature of any of these amino acids. \u201cInsertions\u201d or \u201cdeletions\u201d can be within the range of variation as structurally or functionally tolerated by the recombinant proteins. The variation allowed can be experimentally determined by systematically making insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids in a polypeptide molecule using recombinant DNA techniques and assaying the resulting recombinant variants for activity. \\n     The term \u201cpromoter\u201d refers to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3\u2032 to a promoter sequence. Promoters can be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters can direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental or physiological conditions. Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as \u201cconstitutive promoters.\u201d It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths can have identical promoter activity. \\n     The term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (e.g., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation. \\n     The term \u201cexpression\u201d as used herein, refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from the nucleic acid fragment of the invention. Expression can also refer to translation of mRNA into a polypeptide. \\n     The term \u201coverexpression\u201d as used herein, refers to expression that is higher than endogenous expression of the same or related gene. A heterologous gene is overexpressed if its expression is higher than that of a comparable endogenous gene. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201ctransformation\u201d refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid or fragment into a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as \u201ctransgenic\u201d or \u201crecombinant\u201d or \u201ctransformed\u201d organisms. \\n     The terms \u201cplasmid\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d as used herein refer to an extra chromosomal element often carrying genes that are not part of the central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Such elements can be autonomously replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or nucleotide sequences, linear or circular, of a single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction that is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3\u2032 untranslated sequence into a cell. \\n     As used herein, the term \u201ccodon degeneracy\u201d refers to the nature in the genetic code permitting variation of the nucleotide sequence without affecting the amino acid sequence of an encoded polypeptide. The skilled artisan is well aware of the \u201ccodon-bias\u201d exhibited by a specific host cell in usage of nucleotide codons to specify a given amino acid. Therefore, when synthesizing a gene for improved expression in a host cell, it is desirable to design the gene such that its frequency of codon usage approaches the frequency of preferred codon usage of the host cell. \\n     The term \u201ccodon-optimized\u201d as it refers to genes or coding regions of nucleic acid molecules for transformation of various hosts refers to the alteration of codons in the gene or coding regions of the nucleic acid molecules to reflect the typical codon usage of the host organism without altering the polypeptide encoded by the DNA. Such optimization includes replacing at least one, more than one, or a significant number of codons with one or more codons that are more frequently used in the genes of that organism. \\n     Deviations in the nucleotide sequence that comprise the codons encoding the amino acids of any polypeptide chain allow for variations in the sequence coding for the gene. Since each codon consists of three nucleotides, and the nucleotides comprising DNA are restricted to four specific bases, there are 64 possible combinations of nucleotides, 61 of which encode amino acids (the remaining three codons encode signals ending translation). The \u201cgenetic code\u201d that shows which codons encode which amino acids are reproduced herein in the table below. As a result, many amino acids are designated by more than one codon. For example, the amino acids alanine and proline are coded for by four triplets, serine and arginine by six, whereas tryptophan and methionine are coded by just one triplet. This degeneracy allows for DNA base composition to vary over a wide range without altering the amino acid sequence of the proteins encoded by the DNA. \\n     The Standard Genetic Code \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 T \\n                 C \\n                 A \\n                 G \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                 T \\n                 TTT\\u2003Phe\\u2003(F) \\n                 TCT\\u2003Ser\\u2003(S) \\n                 TAT\\u2003Tyr\\u2003(Y) \\n                 TGT\\u2003Cys\\u2003(C) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 TTC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TCC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TAC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TGC \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 TTA\\u2003Leu\\u2003(L) \\n                 TCA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TAA\\u2003Stop \\n                 TGA\\u2003Stop \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 TTG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TCG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 TAG\\u2003Stop \\n                 TGG\\u2003Trp\\u2003(W) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 C \\n                 CTT\\u2003Leu\\u2003(L) \\n                 CCT\\u2003Pro\\u2003(P) \\n                 CAT\\u2003His\\u2003(H) \\n                 CGT\\u2003Arg\\u2003(R) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 CTC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CCC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CAC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CGC\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 CTA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CCA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CAA\\u2003Gln\\u2003(Q) \\n                 CGA\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 CTG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CCG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CAG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 CGG\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 A \\n                 ATT\\u2003Ile\\u2003(I) \\n                 ACT\\u2003Thr\\u2003(T) \\n                 AAT\\u2003Asn\\u2003(N) \\n                 AGT\\u2003Ser\\u2003(S) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 ATC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 ACC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 AAC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 AGC\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 ATA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 ACA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 AAA\\u2003Lys\\u2003(K) \\n                 AGA\\u2003Arg\\u2003(R) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 ATG\\u2003Met\\u2003(M) \\n                 ACG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 AAG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 AGG\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 G \\n                 GTT\\u2003Val\\u2003(V) \\n                 GCT\\u2003Ala\\u2003(A) \\n                 GAT\\u2003Asp\\u2003(D) \\n                 GGT\\u2003Gly\\u2003(G) \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 GTC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GCC\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GAC\u2033 \\n                 GGC\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 GTA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GCA\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GAA\\u2003Glu\\u2003(E) \\n                 GGA\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 GTG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GCG\\u2003\u2033 \\n                 GAG\u2033 \\n                 GGG\\u2003\u2033 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     Many organisms display a bias for use of particular codons to code for insertion of a particular amino acid in a growing peptide chain. Codon preference, or codon bias, differences in codon usage between organisms, is afforded by degeneracy of the genetic code, and is well documented among many organisms. Codon bias often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, inter alia, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. \\n     Given the large number of gene sequences available for a wide variety of animal, plant and microbial species, it is possible to calculate the relative frequencies of codon usage. Codon usage tables are readily available and can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura et al.,  Nucl. Acids Res.  28:292 (2000). By utilizing this or similar tables, one of ordinary skill in the art can apply the frequencies to any given polypeptide sequence, and produce a nucleic acid fragment of a codon-optimized coding region that encodes the polypeptide, but uses codons optimal for a given species. The present invention pertains to codon optimized forms of OrfA, OrfB, chimeric OrfC, PPTase and/or other accessory proteins of the invention, as described further herein. \\n     The term \u201cpercent identity\u201d as known in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, \u201cidentity\u201d also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as the case can be, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. \u201cIdentity\u201d and \u201csimilarity\u201d can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to those disclosed in: 1) Computational Molecular Biology (A. M. Lesk, Ed.) Oxford University: NY (1988); 2) Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects (D. W. Smith, Ed.) Academic: NY (1993); 3) Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I (A. M. Griffin and H. G. Griffin, Eds.) Humania: NJ (1994); 4) Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology (G. von Heinje, Ed.) Academic (1987); and 5) Sequence Analysis Primer (M. Gribskov and J. Devereux, Eds.) Stockton: NY (1991). \\n     Methods to determine identity are designed to give the best match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations can be performed, for example, using the AlignX program of the Vector NTI\u00ae suite (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or M EG A LIGN \u2122 program of the LASERGENE\u00ae bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.). Multiple alignment of the sequences is performed using the \u201cClustal method of alignment,\u201d which encompasses several varieties of the algorithm including the \u201cClustal V method of alignment\u201d corresponding to the alignment method labeled Clustal V (disclosed by Higgins and Sharp,  CABIOS.  5:151-153 (1989); D. G. Higgins, et al.,  Comput. Appl. Biosci.,  8:189-191 (1992)) and found in the M EG A LIGN \u2122 program of the LASERGENE\u00ae bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR, Inc.). For multiple alignments, the default values correspond to GAP PENALTY=10 and GAP LENGTH PEN ALT Y=10. Default parameters for pairwise alignments and calculation of percent identity of protein sequences using the Clustal method are KTUPLE-T, GAP PENALTY-3, WTNDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5. For nucleic acids these parameters are KTUPLE-2, GAP PENALTY-5, WINDOW=4 and DIAGONALS SAVED=4. After alignment of the sequences using the Clustal V program, it is possible to obtain a \u201cpercent identity\u201d by viewing the \u201csequence distances\u201d table in the same program. Additionally the \u201cClustal W method of alignment\u201d is available and corresponds to the alignment method labeled Clustal W (described by Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS. 5:151-153 (1989); D. G. Higgins, et al., Comput. Appl. Biosci. 8:189-191 (1992)) and found in the M EG A LIGN \u2122 v6.1 program of the LASERGENE\u00ae bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR, Inc.). Default parameters for multiple alignment (GAP PENALTY\u2122 10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=0.2, Delay Divergen Seqs(%)=30, DNA Transition Weight=0.5, Protein Weight Matrix=Gonnet Series, DNA Weight Matrix=IUB). After alignment of the sequences using the Clustal W program, it is possible to obtain a \u201cpercent identity\u201d by viewing the \u201csequence distances\u201d table in the same program. \\n     The term \u201csequence analysis software\u201d refers to any computer algorithm or software program that is useful for the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. \u201cSequence analysis software\u201d can be commercially available or independently developed. Typical sequence analysis software will include, but is not limited to: 1.) the GCG suite of programs (Wisconsin Package Version 9.0, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, Wis.); 2.) BLASTP, BLASTN, BLASTX (Altschul et al.,  J. Mol. Biol.,  215:403-410 (1990)); 3.) DNASTAR\u00ae (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison, Wis.); 4.) SEQUENCHER\u00ae (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Mich.); and 5.) the FASTA program incorporating the Smith-Waterman algorithm (W. R. Pearson,  Comput. Methods Genome Res ., [Proc. Int. Symp.] (1994), Meeting Date 1992, 11 1-20. Editor(s): Suhai, Sandor. Plenum: New York, N.Y.). Within the context of this application it will be understood that where sequence analysis software is used for analysis, that the results of the analysis will be based on the \u201cdefault values\u201d of the program referenced, unless otherwise specified. As used herein \u201cdefault values\u201d will mean any set of values or parameters that originally load with the software when first initialized. \\n     Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used here are well known in the art and are described, e.g., by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2000); and by Silhavy et al., Experiments with Gene Fusions, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1984); and by Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, published by Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley-Interscience (1987 to present). \\n     The genetic manipulations of a recombinant hosts disclosed herein can be performed using standard genetic techniques and screening and can be made in any host cell that is suitable to genetic manipulation. In some embodiments, a recombinant host can be, but is not limited to, any higher plant, including both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, and consumable plants, including crop plants and plants used for their oils. Thus, any plant species or plant cell can be selected as described further below. \\n     The oils of the present invention can also be used in non-culinary or dietary processes and compositions. Some of these uses can be industrial, cosmetic or medical. Oils of the present invention can also be used in any application for which the oils of the present invention are suited. In general, the oils of the present invention can be used to replace, e.g., mineral oils, esters, fatty acids, or animal fats in a variety of applications, such as lubricants, lubricant additives, metal working fluids, hydraulic fluids and fire resistant hydraulic fluids. The oils of the present invention can also be used as materials in a process of producing modified oils. Examples of techniques for modifying oils of the present invention include fractionation, hydrogenation, alteration of the oil&#39;s oleic acid or linolenic acid content, and other modification techniques known to those of skill in the art. \\n     Examples of cosmetic uses for oils of the present invention include use as an emollient in a cosmetic composition; as a petroleum jelly replacement; as comprising part of a soap, or as a material in a process for producing soap; as comprising part of an oral treatment solution; as comprising part of an ageing treatment composition; and as comprising part of a skin or hair aerosol foam preparation. \\n     Additionally, the oils of the present invention can be used in medical applications. For example, oils of the present invention can be used in a protective barrier against infection, and oils high in omega-9 fatty acids can be used to enhance transplant graft survival (U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,700). \\n     It should be understood that the foregoing are non-limiting examples of non-culinary uses for which the oils of the present invention are suited. As previously stated, oils and modified oils of the present invention can be used to replace, e.g., mineral oils, esters, fatty acids, or animal fats in all applications known to those of skill in the art. \\n     PUFA Synthase \\n     The \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cclassical\u201d pathway for synthesis of long chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs) in eukaryotic organisms involves the elongation and desaturation of medium chain-length saturated or mono-unsaturated fatty acids and has been described. The pathway for synthesis of long chain PUFAs via a PUFA synthase has also been described and is very different from the \u201cstandard\u201d pathway. Specifically, PUFA synthases utilize malonyl-CoA as a carbon source and produce the final PUFA without releasing intermediates in any significant amount. Also, with PUFA synthases, the appropriate cis double bonds are added during the synthesis using a mechanism that does not require oxygen. In some embodiments, NADPH is used as a reductant during the synthesis cycles. \\n     The present invention relates to host organisms (e.g., plants such as soybean) that have been genetically modified to express a PUFA synthase (either endogenously or by genetic manipulation). In some embodiments, an organism that has been genetically modified to express a PUFA synthase, wherein the organism does not naturally (endogenously, without genetic modification) express such an enzyme, or at least that particular PUFA synthase or portion thereof with which the organism is being genetically modified, can be referred to herein as a \u201cheterologous\u201d host organism with regard to the modification of the organism with the PUFA synthase or with another protein that is not endogenously expressed by the organism. The genetic modifications of the present invention can be used to improve PUFA production in a host organism that endogenously expresses a PUFA synthase, where the organism is not further modified with a different PUFA synthase or a portion thereof. \\n     A PUFA synthase according to the present invention can comprise several multifunctional proteins (and can include single function proteins, particularly for PUFA synthase from marine bacteria) that can act together to conduct both iterative processing of the fatty acid chain as well as non-iterative processing, including trans-cis isomerization and enoyl reduction reactions in selected cycles. These proteins can also be referred to herein as the core PUFA synthase enzyme complex or the core PUFA synthase. The general functions of the domains and motifs contained within these proteins are individually known in the art and have been described in detail with regard to various PUFA synthases from marine bacteria and eukaryotic organisms (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,486; U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,583; Metz et al., Science 293:290-293 (2001); U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2002/0194641, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,461, issued Jul. 24, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0235127, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,418, issued May 1, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2005/0100995, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,856, issued May 15, 2007; and WO 2006/135866). The domains can be found as a single protein (e.g., the domain and protein are synonymous) or as one of two or more (multiple) domains in a single protein, as mentioned above. The domain architecture of various PUFA synthases from marine bacteria and members of  Thraustochytrium , and the structural and functional characteristics of genes and proteins comprising such PUFA synthases, have been described (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,486; U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,583; Metz et al., Science 293:290-293 (2001); U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2002/0194641, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,461, issued Jul. 24, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0235127, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,418, issued May 1, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2005/0100995, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,856, issued May 15, 2007; and WO 2006/135866). \\n     Numerous examples of polynucleotides, genes and polypeptides having PUFA synthase activity are known in the art and can be used in a genetically modified host disclosed herein. PUFA synthase proteins or domains that are useful in the present invention can include both bacterial and non-bacterial PUFA synthases. A non-bacterial PUFA synthase is a system that is from or derived from an organism that is not a bacterium, such as a eukaryote. Bacterial PUFA synthases are described, for example, in U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2008/0050505, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,868,228, issued Jan. 11, 2011. Genetically modified plants of the invention can be produced that incorporate non-bacterial PUFA synthase functional domains with bacterial PUFA synthase functional domains, as well as PUFA synthase functional domains or proteins from other PKS systems (Type I iterative or modular, Type II, or Type III) or FAS systems. \\n     In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase of the present invention comprises at least the following biologically active domains that are typically contained on three, four, or more proteins: (a) at least one enoyl-ACP reductase (ER) domain; (b) multiple acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain(s) (e.g., at least from one to four, or at least five ACP domains, and in some embodiments up to six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more than ten ACP domains); (c) at least two \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS) domains; (d) at least one acyltransferase (AT) domain; (e) at least one \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR) domain; (f) at least two FabA-like \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (DH) domains; (g) at least one chain length factor (CLF) domain; and/or (h) at least one malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase (MAT) domain. In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase according to the present invention also comprises at least one region containing a dehydratase (DH) conserved active site motif. \\n     In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase comprises at least the following biologically active domains: (a) at least one enoyl-ACP reductase (ER) domain; (b) at least five acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains; (c) at least two \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KS) domains; (d) at least one acyltransferase (AT) domain; (e) at least one \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (KR) domain; (f) at least two FabA-like \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase (DH) domains; (g) at least one chain length factor (CLF) domain; and (h) at least one malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase (MAT) domain. In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase according to the present invention also comprises at least one region or domain containing a dehydratase (DH) conserved active site motif that is not a part of a FabA-like DH domain.

In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encodes an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 2, or 3, or any combinations or percent identities thereof described herein. \\n     In some embodiments, the sequences of other PUFA synthase genes and/or polypeptides can be identified in the literature and in bioinformatics databases well known to the skilled person using sequences disclosed herein and available in the art. For example, such sequences can be identified through BLAST searching of publicly available databases with known PUFA synthase gene or polypeptide sequences. In such a method, identities can be based on the Clustal W method of alignment using the default parameters of GAP PEN ALT Y=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY\u20140.1, and Gonnet 250 series of protein weight matrix. \\n     Additionally, the PUFA synthase gene or polypeptide sequences disclosed herein or known the art can be used to identify other PUFA synthase homologs in nature. For example, each of the PUFA synthase nucleic acid fragments disclosed herein can be used to isolate genes encoding homologous proteins. Isolation of homologous genes using sequence-dependent protocols is well known in the art. Examples of sequence-dependent protocols include, but are not limited to (1) methods of nucleic acid hybridization; (2) methods of DNA and RNA amplification, as exemplified by various uses of nucleic acid amplification technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Mullis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202; ligase chain reaction (LCR), S. Tabor, et al., Proc. Acad. Sci. USA 82:1074 (1985); or strand displacement amplification (SDA), Walker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 89:392 (1992)); and (3) methods of library construction and screening by complementation. \\n     All of these methods can be readily practiced by one skilled in the art making use of the known or identified sequences encoding target proteins. In some embodiments, DNA sequences surrounding a target PUFA synthase coding sequence are also useful in some modification procedures and can be readily found by one of skill in the art in publicly available databases. Methods for creating genetic mutations are common and well known in the art and can be applied to the exercise of creating mutants. \\n     Phosphopantethienyl Transferase \\n     The phosphopantethienyl transferases (PPTases) are a family of enzymes that have been well characterized in fatty acid synthesis, polyketide synthesis, and non-ribosomal peptide synthesis. In particular, the ACP domains present in the PUFA synthase enzymes require activation by attachment of a cofactor (4-phosphopantetheine) from coenzyme A to the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Attachment of this cofactor is carried out by PPTases. If the endogenous PPTases of the host organism are incapable of activating the PUFA synthase ACP domains, then it is necessary to provide a PPTase that is capable of carrying out that function. The sequences of many PPTases are known, and crystal structures have been determined (e.g., Reuter et al., EMBO J. 18:6823-31 (1999)) as well as mutational analysis of amino acid residues important for activity (Mofid et al., Biochemistry 43:4128-36 (2004)). \\n     One example of a heterologous PPTase that has been demonstrated previously to recognize the OrfA ACP domains described herein as substrates is the Het I protein of  Nostoc  sp. PCC 7120 (formerly called  Anabaena  sp. PCC 7120). Het I is present in a cluster of genes in  Nostoc  known to be responsible for the synthesis of long chain hydroxy-fatty acids that are a component of a glyco-lipid layer present in heterocysts of that organism (Black and Wolk,  J. Bacteriol.  775:2282-2292 (1994); Campbell et al.,  Arch. Microbiol.  7(57:251-258 (1997)). Het I is likely to activate the ACP domains of a protein, Hgl E, present in that cluster. The two ACP domains of Hgl E have a high degree of sequence homology to the ACP domains found in  Schizochytrium  Orf A and other PUFA synthases. \\n     In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase can be considered to include at least one 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) domain, or such a domain can be considered to be an accessory domain or protein to the PUFA synthase. Structural and functional characteristics of PPTases have been described in detail, for example, in U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2002/0194641, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,461, issued Jul. 24, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0235127, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,418, issued May 1, 2007; and U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2005/0100995, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,856, issued May 15, 2007. \\n     Numerous examples of genes and polypeptides having PPTase activity are known in the art and could be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention if they are capable of activating the ACP domains of the particular PUFA synthase being used. Examples of genes and polypeptides that can be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention can include, but are not limited to, the following codon-optimized sequences described further herein: SEQ ID NO:5 (NoHetI v3 protein) and SEQ ID NO:10 (NoHetI v3 gene). \\n     Other examples of PPTase genes and polypeptides that can be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention include, but are not limited to, PPTase genes or polypeptides having at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% sequence identity to any one of the PPTases or sequences described herein. Useful ranges can be selected between any of these values (for example, 80% to 100% identical, 85% to 100% identical, 90% to 100% identical, 95% to 100% identical, 80% to 99% identical, 85% to 99% identical, 90% to 99% identical, or 95% to 99% identical). Still other examples of PPTase genes and polypeptides that can used in a genetically modified organism of the invention include, but are not limited to an active variant, fragment, portion or derivative of any one of the PPTase sequences described herein, wherein such a gene encodes, or such a polypeptide has, PPTase activity. \\n     In some embodiments, the PPTase can be an algal PPTase. In some embodiments, the PPTase can comprise an amino acid sequence that is 80% to 100% identical, 85%&gt;&gt; to 100% identical, 90% to 100% identical, 95% to 100% identical, 80% to 99% identical, 85% to 99% identical, 90% to 99% identical, or 95% to 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the PPTase can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the PPTase can comprise a nucleic acid sequence 80% to 100% identical, 85% to 100% identical, 90% to 100% identical, 95% to 100% identical, 80% to 99% identical, 85% to 99% identical, 90% to 99% identical, or 95% to 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the PPTase can comprise the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:10. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encodes an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or any percent identities thereof described herein. \\n     In some embodiments of the present invention, a PPTase can be provided for production and/or accumulation of PPTase in a heterologous host. \\n     In some embodiments, a gene and/or polypeptide encoding PPTase can be used to identify another PPTase gene and/or polypeptide sequences and/or can be used to identify a PPTase homolog in other cells. Such PPTase encoding sequences can be identified, for example, in the literature and/or in bioinformatics databases well known to the skilled person. For example, the identification of a PPTase encoding sequence in another cell type using bioinformatics can be accomplished through BLAST (as disclosed above) searching of publicly available databases with a known PPTase encoding DNA and polypeptide sequence, such as any of those provided herein. Identities are based on the Clustal W method of alignment using the default parameters of GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=0.1, and Gonnet 250 series of protein weight matrix. \\n     In some embodiments, the genetically modified plant (e.g., soybean), descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof contains a PUFA synthase and a PPTase. In some embodiments, the genetically modified plant (e.g., soybean), descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof contains the nucleic acid sequences of (i) and (ii) in a single recombinant expression vector. In some embodiments, the genetically modified plant (e.g., soybean), descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof contains the nucleic acid sequences of (i) and (ii) in different recombinant expression vectors. \\n     Acyl-CoA Synthetase \\n     The present invention provides acyl-CoA synthetase (ACoAS) proteins that catalyze the conversion of long chain PUFA free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl-CoA. The endogenous producer of PUFAs by PUFA synthase,  Schizochytrium , possesses one or more ACoASs that are capable of converting the free fatty acid products of its PUFA synthase into acyl-CoA. Therefore,  Schizochytrium , as well as other organisms that endogenously contain a PUFA synthase (e.g., other  Thraustochytrids ) or other organisms that can convert PUFA FFAs into acyl-CoAs (such as  Thalassiosira pseudonana  or  Crypthecodinium cohnii ), could represent sources for genes encoding enzymes that are useful in permitting or increasing the accumulation of the products of a PUFA synthase expressed in a heterologous host. Other ACoAS sequences have been described in U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2007/0245431. \\n     Numerous examples of genes and polypeptides having ACoAS activity are known in the art and can be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention. Examples of genes and polypeptides that can be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention can include, but are not limited to, the following codon-optimized sequences described further herein: SEQ ID NO:4 (SzACS-2 v3 protein) and SEQ ID NO:9 (hSzThACS-2 v3 gene). \\n     Other examples of ACoAS genes and polypeptides that can be used in a genetically modified organism of the invention include, but are not limited to, ACoAS genes or polypeptides having at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% sequence identity to any one of the ACoAS or sequences described herein. Useful ranges can be selected between any of these values (for example, 80% to 100% identical, 85% to 100% identical, 90% to 100% identical, 95% to 100% identical, 80% to 99% identical, 85% to 99% identical, 90% to 99% identical, or 95% to 99% identical). Still other examples of ACoAS genes and polypeptides that can used in a genetically modified organism of the invention include, but are not limited to an active variant, fragment, portion, or derivative of any one of the ACoAS sequences described herein, wherein such a gene encodes, or such a polypeptide has, ACoAS activity. \\n     In some embodiments, the ACoAS can be an algal ACoAS. In some embodiments, the ACoAS can comprise an amino acid sequence that is 80% to 100% identical, 85% to 100% identical, 90% to 100% identical, 95% to 100% identical, 80% to 99% identical, 85% to 99% identical, 90% to 99% identical, or 95% to 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. In some embodiments, the ACoAS can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.

In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the ACoAS can comprise the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:9. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encoding the ACoAS comprises the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:34. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence encodes an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 or any percent identity thereof described herein. \\n     In some embodiments of the present invention, ACoAS can be provided for production and/or accumulation of ACoAS in a heterologous host as well as for improved production and/or accumulation of ACoAS in an endogenous host. \\n     In some embodiments, a gene and/or polypeptide encoding ACoAS can be used to identify another ACoAS gene and/or polypeptide sequences and/or can be used to identify an ACoAS homolog in other cells. Such ACoAS encoding sequences can be identified, for example, in the literature and/or in bioinformatics databases well known to the skilled person. For example, the identification of a ACoAS encoding sequence in another cell type using bioinformatics can be accomplished through BLAST (as disclosed above) searching of publicly available databases with a known ACoAS encoding DNA and polypeptide sequence, such as any of those provided herein. Identities are based on the Clustal W method of alignment using the default parameters of GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=0.1, and Gonnet 250 series of protein weight matrix. \\n     In some embodiments, the genetically modified plant (e.g., soybean), descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof comprises a PUFA synthase and a ACoAS, or a PUFA synthase, a PPTase and a ACoAS. In some embodiments, the genetically modified plant (e.g., soybean), descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof comprises the nucleic acid sequences of (i), (ii) or (iii), or any combinations thereof, contained in a single recombinant expression vector. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences of (i), (ii) and (iii) are contained in different recombinant expression vectors. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences of (i) and (ii) are contained in a single recombinant expression vector and the nucleic acid sequence of (iii) is contained in a different recombinant expression vector. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences of (i) and (iii) are contained in a single recombinant expression vector and the nucleic acid sequence of (ii) is contained in a different recombinant expression vector. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences of (ii) and (iii) are contained in a single recombinant expression vector and the nucleic acid sequence of (i) is contained in a different recombinant expression vector. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequences of (i), (ii) or (iii), or any combinations thereof, are under the control of one or more seed-specific promoters. \\n     Methods of Making Genetically Modified Organisms \\n     To produce significantly high yields of one or more desired polyunsaturated fatty acids, a plant can be genetically modified to introduce a PUFA synthase into the plant. The present invention also relates to methods to improve or enhance the effectiveness of such genetic modification and particularly, to improve or enhance the production and/or accumulation of the end product of a PUFA synthase, e.g., PUFAs. \\n     Methods for gene expression in a genetically modified organism, including, but not limited to plants, are known in the art. In some embodiments, the coding region for the PUFA synthase genes to be expressed can be codon optimized for the target host cell as described below. Expression of genes in recombinant host cells including, but not limited to, plant cells, can require a promoter operably linked to a coding region of interest, and/or a transcriptional terminator. A number of promoters can be used in constructing vectors for genes, including but not limited to a seed-specific promoter (e.g., PvDlec2, LfKCS3, FAE 1, BoACP, or BnaNapinC) or a leaf-specific promoter (e.g., ubiquitin or CsVMV). Other non-limiting examples of promoters that can be used in the present invention include the acyl carrier protein promoter disclosed in WO 1992/18634; the  Phaseolus vulgaris  beta-phaseolin promoter and truncated versions disclosed in Slightom et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80: 1897-1901; 1983); Sengupta-Gopalan et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 82: 3320-3324; 1985); van der Geest et al. (Plant Mol. Biol. 33: 553-557; 1997), and Bustos et al. (EMBO J. 10: 1469-1479; 1991). \\n     In some embodiments of the present invention, a recombinant vector is an engineered (e.g., artificially produced) nucleic acid molecule that is used as a tool for manipulating a nucleic acid sequence of choice and for introducing such a nucleic acid sequence into a host cell. The recombinant vector is therefore suitable for use in cloning, sequencing, and/or otherwise manipulating the nucleic acid sequence of choice, such as by expressing and/or delivering the nucleic acid sequence of choice into a host cell to form a recombinant cell. Such a vector typically contains heterologous nucleic acid sequences, that is nucleic acid sequences that are not naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid sequence to be cloned or delivered, although the vector can also contain regulatory nucleic acid sequences (e.g., promoters, untranslated regions) that are naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid molecules of the present invention or that are useful for expression of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. The vector can be either RNA or DNA, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and typically is a plasmid. The vector can be maintained as an extrachromosomal element (e.g., a plasmid) or it can be integrated into the chromosome of a recombinant organism (e.g., a microbe or a plant). The entire vector can remain in place within a host cell, or under certain conditions, the plasmid DNA can be deleted, leaving behind the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention. The integrated nucleic acid molecule can be under chromosomal promoter control, under native or plasmid promoter control, or under a combination of several promoter controls. Single or multiple copies of the nucleic acid molecule can be integrated into the chromosome. A recombinant vector of the present invention can contain at least one selectable marker. \\n     In some embodiments, a recombinant vector used in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is an expression vector. In such embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the product to be produced (e.g., a PUFA synthase) is inserted into the recombinant vector to produce a recombinant nucleic acid molecule. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein to be produced is inserted into the vector in a manner that operatively links the nucleic acid sequence to regulatory sequences in the vector that enable the transcription and translation of the nucleic acid sequence within the recombinant host cell. \\n     Vectors useful for the transformation of a variety of host organisms and cells are common and disclosed in the literature. Typically the vector contains a selectable marker and sequences allowing autonomous replication or chromosomal integration in the desired host. In addition, suitable vectors can comprise a promoter region that harbors transcriptional initiation controls and a transcriptional termination control region, between which a coding region DNA fragment can be inserted, to provide expression of the inserted coding region. Both control regions can be derived from genes homologous to the transformed host cell, although it is to be understood that such control regions can also be derived from genes that are not native to the specific species chosen as a production host. \\n     The present invention includes the expression of one or more acyl-CoA synthetases as described and exemplified herein with a PUFA synthase as described herein and with an exogenous PPTase that are utilized alone or in combination with any one or more strategies described herein (e.g., any one, two, three, or four of: codon optimization, organelle-targeting, enhancement of PUFA synthase competition for malonyl CoA (e.g., by inhibition of FAS), and/or expression of one or more acyltransferases or related enzymes), to increase PUFA production and/or accumulation in a heterologous host. \\n     Some embodiments of the invention relate to the targeting of expression of the PUFA synthase enzymes, the PPTase, and/or any one or more of the accessory proteins and/or targeted genetic modifications to one or more organelles of the host. For example, in some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase system and the PPTase can be targeted to the plastid of a plant. In some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase and the PPTase is targeted to the cytosol. In some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase and the PPTase is targeted to both the plastid and the cytosol of a plant. In any of these embodiments, other targets can be directed to the plastid or the cytosol. \\n     In some embodiments, acyl-CoA synthetases are expressed in the cytosol to convert the DHA and/or other LC-PUFA free fatty acids to acyl-CoAs, which in turn can be utilized by the acyltransferases. \\n     A variety of plastid targeting sequences are known in the art and can be used in embodiments where the heterologous host is a plant or plant cell, and wherein targeting to the plastid is desired. \\n     The present invention includes the use of organelle targeting (e.g., to the plastid or chloroplast in plants) with expression of a PUFA synthase as described herein and with an exogenous PPTase, which are utilized alone or in combination with any one or more strategies described herein (e.g., any one, two, three, or four of: codon optimization, enhancement of PUFA synthase competition for malonyl CoA (e.g., by inhibition of FAS), expression of one or more acyl-CoA synthetases, and/or expression of one or more acyltransferases or related enzymes), to increase PUFA production and/or accumulation in a heterologous host. \\n     The targeting of gene products to the plastid or chloroplast is controlled by a signal sequence found at the amino terminal end of various proteins, which is cleaved during import yielding the mature protein (e.g., with regard to chloroplast targeting, see, e.g., Comai et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:15104-15109 (1988)). These signal sequences can be fused to heterologous gene products to effect the import of heterologous products into the chloroplast (van den Broeck et al. Nature 313:358-363 (1985)). DNA encoding for appropriate signal sequences can be isolated from the cDNAs encoding the RUBISCO protein, the CAB protein, the EPSP synthase enzyme, the GS2 protein and many other proteins that are known to be chloroplast localized. \\n     In some embodiments of the invention, the localization of proteins employed in the invention is directed to a subcellular compartment, for example, to the plastid or chloroplast. Proteins can be directed to the chloroplast by including at their amino-terminus a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP). Similarly, proteins can be directed to the plastid by including at their N-terminus a plastid transit or signaling peptide. \\n     Naturally occurring chloroplast targeted proteins, synthesized as larger precursor proteins containing an amino-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide directing the precursor to the chloroplast import machinery, are well known in the art. Chloroplast targeting peptides are generally cleaved by specific endoproteases located within the chloroplast organelle, thus releasing the targeted mature and can active enzyme from the precursor into the chloroplast milieu. Examples of sequences encoding peptides that are suitable for directing the targeting of the gene or gene product to the chloroplast or plastid of the plant cell include the petunia EPSPS CTP, the  Arabidopsis  EPSPS CTP2 and intron, and others known to those skilled in the art. Such targeting sequences provide for the desired expressed protein to be transferred to the cell structure in which it most effectively functions, or by transferring the desired expressed protein to areas of the cell in which cellular processes necessary for desired phenotypic function are concentrated. Specific examples of chloroplast targeting peptides are well known in the art and include the  Arabidopsis thaliana  ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit ats1A transit peptide, an  Arabidopsis thaliana  EPSPS transit peptide, and a  Zea maize  ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit transit peptide. \\n     An optimized transit peptide is described, for example, by van den Broeck et al., Nature, 313:358-363 (1985). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal sequences are disclosed, for example, by Michaelis et al., Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 36:425 (1982). Additional examples of transit peptides that can be used in the invention include the chloroplast transit peptides such as those described in Von Heijne et al., Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 9:104-126 (1991); Mazur et al., Plant Physiol. 85:1110 (1987); and Vorst et al., Gene 65:59 (1988). Chen &amp; Jagendorf (J. Biol. Chem. 268:2363-2367 (1993)) have described use of a chloroplast transit peptide for import of a heterologous transgene. This peptide used is the transit peptide from the rbcS gene from  Nicotiana plumbaginifolia  (Poulsen et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 205: 193-200 (1986)). One CTP that has functioned herein to localize heterologous proteins to the chloroplast was derived from  Brassica napus  acyl-ACP thioesterase. \\n     An alternative means for localizing genes to chloroplast or plastid includes chloroplast or plastid transformation. Recombinant plants can be produced in which only the chloroplast DNA has been altered to incorporate the molecules envisioned in this application. Promoters that function in chloroplasts are known in the art (Hanley-Bowden et al., Trends in Biochemical Sciences 12:67-70 (1987)). Methods and compositions for obtaining cells containing chloroplasts into which heterologous DNA has been inserted have been described, for example, by Daniell et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,507) and Maliga et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,513). \\n     Combinations of Strategies \\n     According to the present invention, in the production of a heterologous host for the production and accumulation of one or more target PUFAs, any one or more (any combination) of the strategies described herein for improving the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs in the host can be used. Indeed, it is anticipated that various combinations of strategies will be additive or synergistic and provide improved production and/or accumulation of PUFAs as compared to in the absence of one or more such strategies. Indeed, the Examples provide exemplary strategies for the production of PUFAs in a host organism. \\n     Any plant or plant cell using these combinations of modifications, or any other modification or combination of modifications described herein, is encompassed by the invention. In some embodiments, such a plant has been further genetically modified to express an accessory protein as described herein for the improvement of the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs (or other bioactive products of the PUFA synthase) by the host (e.g., ACoAS, GPAT, LPAAT, DAGAT or acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase)). Furthermore, any host cell or organism using any modifications or combination of modifications described herein is encompassed by the invention, as are any products derived from such cell or organisms, including seed or oil comprising the target PUFAs. \\n     In some embodiments, plants to genetically modify according to the present invention (e.g., plant host cells) includes, but is not limited to, any higher plants, including both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, and particularly consumable plants, including crop plants and especially plants used for their oils. Such plants can include, but are not limited to, for example: soybean, rapeseed, linseed, corn, safflowers, sunflowers and tobacco. Thus, any plant species or plant cell can be selected. In some embodiments, the plant is of the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae, legume family, pea family, bean family or pulse family). In some embodiments, the plant is of the genus  Glycine . In some embodiments, the plant is  Glycine albicans, Glycine aphyonota, Glycine arenari, Glycine argyrea, Glycine canescens, Glycine clandestine, Glycine curvata, Glycine cyrtoloba, Glycine falcate, Glycine gracei, Glycine hirticaulis, Glycine hirticaulis  subsp.  leptosa, Glycine lactovirens, Glycine latifolia, Glycine latrobeana, Glycine microphylla, Glycine montis - douglas, Glycine peratosa, Glycine pescadrensis, Glycine pindanica, Glycine pullenii, Glycine rubiginosa, Glycine stenophita, Glycine syndetika, Glycine tabacina, Glycine tomentella, Glycine soja , or  Glycine max  (soybean). In some embodiments, the plant is peanut, beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), broad beans ( Vicia faba ) or peas ( Pisum sativum ). \\n     \u201cPlant parts,\u201d as used herein, include any parts of a plant, including, but not limited to, seeds (including mature seeds and immature seeds), pollen, embryos, flowers, fruits, shoots, leaves, roots, stems, explants, etc. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant has a genome that is modified (e.g., mutated or changed) from its normal (e.g., wild-type or naturally occurring) form such that the desired result is achieved (e.g., increased or modified PUFA synthase and/or production and/or accumulation of a desired product using the PUFA synthase). In some embodiments, genetic modification of a plant can be accomplished using classical strain development and/or molecular genetic techniques. Methods for producing a transgenic plant, wherein a recombinant nucleic acid molecule encoding a desired amino acid sequence is incorporated into the genome of the plant, are known in the art. In some embodiments, a plant to genetically modify according to the present invention is a plant suitable for consumption by animals, including humans. \\n     Plant lines from these plants, optimized for a particularly desirable trait, e.g., disease resistance, ease of plant transformation, oil content or profile, etc., can be produced, selected or identified. In some embodiments, plant lines can be selected through plant breeding, or through methods such as marker assisted breeding and tilling. In some embodiments, plant cell cultures can be used and, for example, are not grown into differentiated plants and cultivated using ordinary agricultural practices, but instead grown and maintained in a liquid medium. \\n     In some embodiments, the plant can be an oil seed plant, wherein the oil seeds, and/or the oil in the oil seeds contain PUFAs produced by the PUFA synthase. In some embodiments, such oils can contain a detectable amount of at least one target or primary PUFA that is the product of the PUFA synthase. In some embodiments, such oils can be substantially free of intermediate or side products that are not the target or primary PUFA products and that are not naturally produced by the endogenous FAS system in the wild-type plants (e.g., wild-type plants produce some shorter or medium chain PUFAs, such as 18 carbon PUFAs, via the FAS system, but there will be new, or additional, fatty acids produced in the plant as a result of genetic modification with a PUFA synthase). \\n     With regard to the production of genetically modified plants, methods for the genetic engineering of plants are well known in the art. For instance, numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical transformation protocols for dicotyledonous plants as well as monocotyledonous plants (e.g., Goto-Fumiyuki et al., Nature Biotech 17:282-286 (1999); and Miki et al., Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, B. R. Glick and J. E. Thompson, Eds., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, pp. 67-88 (1993)). In addition, vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available, for example, in Gruber et al., Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, B. R. Glick and J. E. Thompson, Eds., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, pp. 89-119 (1993). \\n     The present invention is drawn to an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 6-10 as well as an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a modification or mutation of such a sequence as described herein.

The term \u201ctransformation\u201d can be used interchangeably with the term \u201ctransfection\u201d when such term is used to refer to the introduction of nucleic acid molecules into microbial cells, such as algae, bacteria and yeast, or into plant cells. In microbial and plant systems, the term \u201ctransformation\u201d is used to describe an inherited change due to the acquisition of exogenous nucleic acids by the microorganism or plant and is essentially synonymous with the term \u201ctransfection.\u201d In some embodiments, transfection techniques include, but are not limited to, transformation, particle bombardment, diffusion, active transport, bath sonication, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, adsorption, infection and protoplast fusion. \\n     A widely utilized method for introducing an expression vector into plants is based on the natural transformation system of  Agrobacterium . Horsch et al., Science 227:1229 (1985).  A. tumefaciens  and  A. rhizogenes  are plant pathogenic soil bacteria known to be useful to genetically transform plant cells. The Ti and Ri plasmids of  A. tumefaciens  and  A. rhizogenes , respectively, carry genes responsible for genetic transformation of the plant. C. I. Kado, Crit. Rev. Plant. Sci. 10:1 (1991). Descriptions of  Agrobacterium  vector systems and methods for  Agrobacterium -mediated gene transfer are also available, e.g., Gruber et al., supra, Miki et al., supra, Moloney et al., Plant Cell Reports 8:238 (1989), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,940,838 and 5,464,763. \\n     Another known method of plant transformation is microprojectile-mediated transformation wherein DNA is carried on the surface of microprojectiles. In this method, the expression vector is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds sufficient to penetrate plant cell walls and membranes. Sanford et al., Part. Sci. Technol. 5:27 (1987), J. C. Sanford, Trends Biotech. 6:299 (1988), J. C. Sanford, Physiol. Plant 79:206 (1990), Klein et al., Biotechnology 10:268 (1992). \\n     Yet another method for physical delivery of DNA to plants is sonication of target cells. Zhang et al., Bio/Technology 9:996 (1991). Also, liposome or spheroplast fusion have been used to introduce expression vectors into plants. Deshayes et al., EMBO J., 4:2731 (1985), Christou et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3962 (1987). Direct uptake of DNA into protoplasts using CaCl 2  precipitation, polyvinyl alcohol or poly-L-ornithine have also been reported. Hain et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 199:161 (1985) and Draper et al., Plant Cell Physiol. 23:451 (1982). Electroporation of protoplasts and whole cells and tissues has also been described. Donn et al., Abstracts of VIIth International Congress on Plant Cell and Tissue Culture IAPTC, A2-38, p. 53 (1990); D&#39;Halluin et al., Plant Cell 4:1495-1505 (1992) and Spencer et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 24:51-61 (1994). Additionally, silicone carbide whiskers (Kaepler et al., 1990, Plant Cell Reports) and in plant transformation using, for example, a flower dipping methodology (Clough and Bent, Plant J. 16:735-743 (1998)) can also be used. The exact plant transformation methodology can vary somewhat depending on the plant species selected and the plant cell type selected for transformation (e.g., seedling derived cell types such as hypocotyls and cotyledons or embryonic tissue). \\n     Following the introduction of the genetic construct into plant cells, plant cells can be grown and upon emergence of differentiating tissue such as shoots and roots, mature plants can be generated. In some embodiments, a plurality of plants can be generated. Methodologies for regenerating plants are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be found, for example, in: Plant Cell and Tissue Culture, 1994, Vasil and Thorpe Eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers and in: Plant Cell Culture Protocols (Methods in Molecular Biology 111, 1999 Hall Eds Humana Press). \\n     In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant described herein can be cultured in a fermentation medium or grown in a suitable medium such as soil. In some embodiments, a suitable growth medium for higher plants can include any growth medium for plants, including, but not limited to, soil, sand, any other particulate media that support root growth (e.g., vermiculite, perlite, etc.) or hydroponic culture, as well as suitable light, water and nutritional supplements that optimize the growth of the higher plant. \\n     It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that use of recombinant DNA technologies can improve control of expression of transfected nucleic acid molecules by manipulating, for example, the number of copies of the nucleic acid molecules within the host cell, the efficiency with which those nucleic acid molecules are transcribed, the efficiency with which the resultant transcripts are translated, and the efficiency of post-translational modifications. Additionally, the promoter sequence might be genetically engineered to improve the level of expression as compared to the native promoter. Recombinant techniques useful for controlling the expression of nucleic acid molecules include, but are not limited to, integration of the nucleic acid molecules into one or more host cell chromosomes, addition of vector stability sequences to plasmids, substitutions or modifications of transcription control signals(e.g., promoters, operators, enhancers), substitutions or modifications of translational control signals (e.g., ribosome binding sites, Shine-Dalgarno sequences), modification of nucleic acid molecules to correspond to the codon usage of the host cell, and deletion of sequences that destabilize transcripts. \\n     In some embodiments, a plant can include those plants that are known to produce compounds used as pharmaceutical agents, flavoring agents, nutraceutical agents, functional food ingredients or cosmetically active agents or plants that are genetically engineered to produce these compounds/agents. \\n     All of these embodiments of the invention apply to the discussion of any of the genetically modified organisms and methods of producing and using such organisms as described herein. \\n     Products from Genetically Modified Organisms \\n     In some embodiments, a genetically modified organism of the invention produces one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), DP A (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), ARA (C20:4, n-6), GLA (CI 8:3, n-6), ALA (C18:3, n-3), and/or SDA (C18:4, n-3)), and in some embodiments, one or more longer-chain PUFAs, including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), DPA (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), or DTA (C22:4, n-6), or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant of the invention produces one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), and/or DPA (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant of the invention does not have a high oleic background. \\n     In some embodiments, a genetically modified organism is a plant that has been genetically modified to recombinantly express a PUFA synthase and a PPTase, as described herein. In some embodiments, such a plant has been genetically modified further to express an accessory protein as described herein for the improvement of the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs (or other bioactive products of the PUFA synthase) by the host (e.g., ACoAS, GPAT, LPAAT, DAGAT or ACCase). \\n     Some embodiments of the present invention include the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids of desired chain length and with desired numbers of double bonds and, by extension, oil seed and oils obtained from the genetically modified plants described herein (e.g., obtained from the oil or seeds of such plants) comprising these PUFAs. Examples of PUFAs that can be produced by the present invention include, but are not limited to, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, n-3)), ARA (eicosatetraenoic acid or arachidonic acid (C20:4, n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5, n-6 or n-3)), and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3)), and any combinations thereof. The present invention allows for the production of commercially valuable lipids enriched in one or more desired (target or primary) PUFAs by the development of genetically modified plants through the use of a PUFA synthase that produces PUFAs. \\n     In some embodiments, a given PUFA synthase derived from a particular organism will produce particular PUFA(s), such that selection of a PUFA synthase from a particular organism will result in the production of specified target or primary PUFAs. In some embodiments, the ratio of the PUFAs can differ depending on the selection of the particular PUFA synthase and on how that system responds to the specific conditions in which it is expressed. For example, use of a PUFA synthase from  Thraustochytrium  23 B (ATCC No. 20892) can also result in the production of DHA and DPA(n-6) as the target or primary PUFAs; however, in the case of  Thraustochytrium  23B, the ratio of DHA to DPA(n-6) is 10:1 (and can range from 8:1 to 40:1), whereas in  Schizochytrium , the ratio is typically 2.5:1. In some embodiments, a given PUFA synthase can be modified by intermixing proteins and domains from different PUFA synthases, or one can modify a domain or protein of a given PUFA synthase to change the target PUFA product and/or ratios. \\n     In some embodiments, reference to \u201cintermediate products\u201d or \u201cside products\u201d of an enzyme system that produces PUFAs refers to any products, and particularly, fatty acid products, that are produced by the enzyme system as a result of the production of the target or primary PUFA(s) of the system, but that are not the primary or target PUFA(s). In some embodiments, intermediate and side products can include non-target fatty acids that are naturally produced by the wild-type plant, or by the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification, but are now classified as intermediate or side products because they are produced in greater levels as a result of the genetic modification, as compared to the levels produced by the wild-type plant, or by the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification. In some embodiments, a primary or target PUFA of one enzyme system can be an intermediate of a different enzyme system where the primary or target product is a different PUFA. For example, when using the standard pathway to produce EPA, fatty acids such as GLA, DGLA and SDA are produced as intermediate products in significant quantities (e.g., U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682). Similarly, and also illustrated by U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682, when using the standard pathway to produce DHA, in addition to the fatty acids mentioned above, ETA and EPA (notably the target PUFA in the first example above) can be produced in significant quantities and can be present in significantly greater quantities relative to the total fatty acid product than the target PUFA itself. \\n     In some embodiments, to produce significantly high yields of one or more desired polyunsaturated fatty acids, a plant can be genetically modified to introduce a PUFA synthase system into the plant. Plants are not known to endogenously contain a PUFA synthase, and therefore, the present invention represents an opportunity to produce plants with unique fatty acid production capabilities. The present invention provides genetically engineered plants to produce one or more PUFAs in the same plant, including, but not limited to, EPA, DHA, DPA (n3 or n6), ARA, GLA, SDA and others, including any combination thereof. The present invention offers the ability to create any one of a number of \u201cdesigner oils\u201d in various ratios and forms. In some embodiments, the use of a PUFA synthase from the particular marine organisms described herein can extend the range of PUFA production and successfully produce such PUFAs within temperature ranges used to grow most crop plants. \\n     In some embodiments, to be \u201csubstantially free\u201d of intermediate or side products of the system for synthesizing PUFAs, or to not have intermediate or side products present in substantial amounts, means that any intermediate or side product fatty acids (non-target PUFAs) that are produced in the genetically modified plant (and/or parts of plants and/or seed oil fraction) as a result of the introduction or presence of the enzyme system for producing PUFAs (e.g., that are not produced by the wild-type plant or the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification), can be present in a quantity that is less than 10% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 9% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 8% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 7% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 6% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 5% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 4% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 3% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 2% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 1% by weight of total fatty acids, or less than 0.5% by weight of total fatty acids. \\n     In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant, descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof of the invention or an oil or seed obtained from a genetically modified plant, descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof of the invention comprises detectable amounts of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, n-3)), DPA(n-6) (docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-6)) or EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3)).

ATCC 20888 and  Thraustochytrium  (U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2008/0022422, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,003,772, issued Aug. 23, 2011) (also described as \u201chybrid OrfC\u201d), acyl-CoA synthetase from  Schizochytrium  sp. ATCC 20888 (U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2007/0245431), and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI from  Nostoc  sp. PCC 7120 (GenBank ID: P37695, GI:20141367) revealed the presence of several sequence motifs containing non-optimal codon compositions that may be detrimental to optimal plant expression. The design of the gene(s) encoding PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins was optimized to generate a DNA sequence that is more \u201cplant-like\u201d in nature, and in which the sequence modifications do not hinder translation or create mRNA instability through non-optimal codon composition. \\n     Due to the plasticity afforded by the redundancy/degeneracy of the genetic code (e.g., some amino acids are specified by more than one codon), evolution of the genomes in different organisms or classes of organisms has resulted in differential usage of synonymous codons. This \u201ccodon bias\u201d is reflected in the mean base composition of protein coding regions. For example, organisms having genomes with relatively low G+C contents utilize more codons having A or T in the third position of synonymous codons, whereas those having higher G+C contents utilize more codons having G or C in the third position. Further, it is thought that the presence of \u201cminor\u201d codons within an mRNA may reduce the absolute translation rate of that mRNA, especially when the relative abundance of the charged tRNA corresponding to the minor codon is low. An extension of this reasoning is that the diminution of translation rate by individual minor codons would be at least additive for multiple minor codons. Therefore, mRNAs having high relative contents of minor codons would have correspondingly low translation rates. This rate would be reflected by correspondingly low levels of the encoded protein. \\n     In engineering genes encoding a PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI protein for expression in dicotyledonous plants (such as tobacco, soybean, cotton or canola), the codon usages for canola were accessed from publicly available databases (Table 1). \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 1 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 Synonymous codon representation in coding regions of dicotyledonous \\n               \\n               \\n                 plants from  Brassica napus  (canola) genes (Columns C and G).

choices for an amino acid, a Weighted Average representation for each codon was calculated (Table 1), using the formula: Weighted Average % of C1=1/(% C1+% C2+% C3+ etc.)\u00d7% C1\u00d7100, where C1 is the codon in question and % C2, % C3, etc. represent the averages of the % values for canola of remaining synonymous codons (average % values for the relevant codons are taken from Columns C and G) of Table 1. The Weighted Average % value for each codon is given in Columns D and H of Table 1. \\n     In designing coding regions for plant expression, the primary (\u201cfirst choice\u201d) codons preferred by the plant was determined, as well as the second, third, fourth etc. choices of preferred codons when multiple choices exist. A new DNA sequence was then designed that encoded essentially the same amino acid sequence of an PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI, but that differed from the original DNA sequence (encoding the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI) by the substitution of plant (first preferred, second preferred, third preferred, or fourth preferred, etc.) codons to specify the amino acid at each position within the amino acid sequence. \\n     The new sequences were then analyzed for restriction enzyme sites created by the modifications in the sequence. The identified sites were then modified by replacing the codons with first, second, third, or fourth choice preferred codons. The sequence was then further analyzed and modified to reduce the frequency of TA or GC doublets. \\n     Analysis of these sequences revealed that the new DNA sequences encoded essentially the amino acid sequence of the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins but were respectively designed for optimal expression in dicotyledonous plants using a balanced codon distribution of frequently used codons found in canola genes. In particular, the new DNA sequences differed from the original DNA sequences encoding an PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI by the substitution of plant (first preferred, second preferred, third preferred, or fourth preferred) codons to specify the appropriate amino acid at each position within the protein amino acid sequence. \\n     Design of the plant-optimized DNA sequences were initiated by reverse-translation of the protein sequences of PUFA synthase OrfA (SEQ ID NO: 1), PUFA synthase OrfB (SEQ ID NO: 2), PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC (SEQ ID NO: 3), acyl-CoA synthetase (SEQ ID NO: 4) and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI (SEQ ID NO: 5) using a canola codon bias table constructed from Table 1, Columns D and H. The protein sequence for acyl-CoA synthetase (SEQ ID NO: 4) was altered from the original sequence; wherein the second amino acid Alanine was removed from the protein. The initial sequences were then modified by compensating codon changes (while retaining overall weighted average codon representation) to remove or add restriction enzyme recognition sites, remove highly stable intrastrand secondary structures, and remove other sequences that might be detrimental to cloning manipulations or expression of the engineered gene in plants. The DNA sequences were then re-analyzed for restriction enzyme recognition sites that might have been created by the modifications. The identified sites were further modified by replacing the relevant codons with first, second, third, or fourth choice preferred codons. Other sites in the sequences that could affect transcription or translation of the gene of interest include the exon:intron junctions (5\u2032 or 3\u2032), poly A addition signals, or RNA polymerase termination signals. The modified sequences were further analyzed and further modified to reduce the frequency of TA or CG doublets, and to increase the frequency of TG or CT doublets. In addition to these doublets, sequence blocks that have more than about six consecutive residues of [G+C] or [A+T] can affect transcription or translation of the sequence. Therefore, these sequence blocks were also modified by replacing the codons of first or second choice, etc. with other preferred codons of choice. Rarely used codons are not included to a substantial extent in the gene design, being used only when necessary to accommodate a different design criterion than codon composition per se (e.g., addition or deletion of restriction enzyme recognition sites). \\n     The protein encoded by PUFA synthase OrfA comprises 10 repeated \u201cProline-Alanine\u201d domains ranging in size from 17 to 29 amino acids. Interspersed between the Proline-Alanine repeats were 9 longer repeated sequence domains comprising 87 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of these repeats vary at only 4 positions, and there were only two codon choices at each of the variant positions. Analyses of the amino acid sequences of the 9 repeats using the Clustal W computer program generated a homology value of 100%, and an identity value of 95.4%. At the DNA level, the sequences encoding the 9 repeats are 100%) homologous, 89.7% identical, varying at only 27 positions in the 261 bases encoding each repeat (23 of the 27 changes are \u201csilent\u201d differences, in which synonymous codons for the same amino acid are interchanged). \\n     Standard gene design processes cannot easily accommodate developing new codon biased DNA sequences for multiple repeats of this size, since one must continually balance all the codon choices in an individual repeat with the codon choices made at the same position in the other 8 repeats, to avoid generating highly related DNA sequences. For each of the 87 residue repeats, there were more than 4.5\u00d710 43  possible DNA sequences to encode the same amino acid sequence (calculated as the product of the number of synonymous codons for each amino acid in the sequence). Thus, there was a very large computing space available to generate identically-encoding DNA sequences. The following protocol describes a method used to generate (in silico) multiple sequence designs for each individual repeat, followed by comparison of all the sequence versions in bulk to identify a set that represents highly diverged sequences encoding the repeats: \\n     Step 1: Extract the native DNA sequence encoding each repeated amino acid domain as a separate sequence. \\n     Step 2: Import the individual repeated DNA sequences as separate sequences into a gene design program (e.g., OPTGENE\u2122, Ocimum Biosolutions, Hyderabad, India). Steps 3-5 are performed on each sequence separately. \\n     Step 3: Translate the DNA sequence using the standard genetic code. \\n     Step 4: Reverse translate the translated protein sequence using the standard genetic code and the appropriate codon bias table. In this example, a biased codon table compiled from 530  Brassica napus  protein coding regions was used, and each generated sequence was code-named \u201cnap\u201d (for \u201cnapus\u201d) plus the version number. Thus, the first reverse-translated, codon biased sequence for Repeat 1 was named \u201crpt1 nap1.\u201d In this illustration, this process was performed 10 times, to generate 10 DNA sequence versions encoding the protein sequence of Repeat 1. \\n     Step 5: Export the 10 sequence versions into the corresponding number of text files. \\n     Step 6: Repeat Steps 3-5 for each of the other repeated sequence domains. In this illustration, a total of 90 \u201cnap\u201d sequence versions were generated (10 for each repeated element). \\n     Step 7: Import the 90 sequence files into the Clustal W program Mega 3.1 (accessed at Megasoftware) and perform a multiple sequence alignment using all 90 sequences as input. Because these sequences are segments of protein coding regions, the alignments are performed with no gaps allowed. After Clustal W Alignment, a Neighbor-Joining tree is assembled and visualized, and one of the ten codon-optimized sequences for each of the nine repeated domains in the protein is picked visually. Each selected sequence version is chosen from a section of the tree that is the most deeply branched. \\n     Step 8: The chosen sequence for each repeated domain is incorporated into the codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding the entire protein, in the proper position for each particular repeat. \\n     Step 9: Final analyses of the entire codon optimized sequence, including the separately designed diverged repeat elements, are performed to assure the absence of undesired motifs, restriction enzyme recognition sites, etc. \\n     Employing this method with the codon optimization of the PUFA synthase OrfA coding sequence resulted in the selection of repeated Proline-Alanine sequences that are sufficiently diverged to avoid repeated sequence instability. These sequences were chosen from the deepest branches of the Neighbor-Joining tree (i.e., are the most distantly related to one another in this sequence set). Smith-Wasserman global alignments were done for all pair wise combinations and the range of homology was 74-81% with a probable median of 76-77% (Table 2). \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 2 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 Smith-Wasserman homologies of selected codon-optimized sequences of \\n               \\n               \\n                 repeats of PUFA OrfA. \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n                 rpt1 nap9 \\n                 rpt2 nap10 \\n                 rpt3 nap10 \\n                 rpt4 nap1 \\n                 rpt5 nap 10 \\n                 rpt6 nap6 \\n                 rpt7 nap9 \\n                 rpt8 nap4 \\n                 rpt9 nap10 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 rpt1 nap9 \\n                 100 \\n                 77 \\n                 74 \\n                 77 \\n                 74 \\n                 77 \\n                 81 \\n                 76 \\n                 76 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt2 nap10 \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 81 \\n                 76 \\n                 74 \\n                 77 \\n                 79 \\n                 76 \\n                 77 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt3 nap10 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 79 \\n                 80 \\n                 74 \\n                 74 \\n                 76 \\n                 78 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt4 nap1 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 80 \\n                 77 \\n                 75 \\n                 76 \\n                 76 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt5 nap10 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 78 \\n                 77 \\n                 77 \\n                 77 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt6 nap6 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 78 \\n                 76 \\n                 77 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt7 nap9 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 75 \\n                 74 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt8 nap4 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n                 76 \\n               \\n               \\n                 rpt9 nap10 \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 100 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     A Clustal W alignment (Vector NTI, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) of the chosen 9 newly designed coding regions for the 9 repeated domains is shown in  FIG. 1 . Overall, the sequences are 93.1% homologous, 61.7% identical as compared to the original sequences, which were 100% homologous and 89.7% identical. Greater sequence divergence could be achieved by using more than 10 sequence iterations and employing a computer program or mathematical algorithm to select from these sequences (instead of choosing sequences visually). Nevertheless, the sequences exemplified are highly divergent, and produced stable poly-nucleotide fragments. \\n     The newly designed, canola optimized PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI DNA sequences are listed, respectively, in SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9 and SEQ ID NO: 10. These codon optimized sequences are identified as version 3 (v3) throughout the specification, whereas the sequences that are non-codon optimized are referred to as version 2 (v2) throughout the specification. \\n     The resulting DNA sequences have a higher degree of codon diversity, a desirable base composition, contain strategically placed restriction enzyme recognition sites, and lack sequences that might interfere with transcription of the gene, or translation of the product mRNA. Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7 present the comparisons of the codon compositions of the coding regions for the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins found in the original gene, the plant-optimized versions and the codon composition recommendations for a plant optimized

The resulting gene is used to replace the acyl-CoA synthetase expression gene sequence, described above as \u201cSzACS-2 v3.\u201d \\n     Once a plant-optimized DNA sequence has been designed on paper or in silico, actual DNA molecules can be synthesized in the laboratory to correspond in sequence precisely to the designed sequence.

The order of the genes is: SzPUFA OrfA v3, SzPUFA OrfB v3, hSzThPUFA OrfC v3, SzACS-2 v2, NoHetI v3. pDAB7333 also contains the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU: CsVMV promoter v2, PAT v5. AtuORF1 3\u2032 UTR v4 in addition to other regulatory elements such as Overdrive and T-strand border sequences (T-DNA Border A and T-DNA Border B). Recombinant plasmids containing the six PTUs were then isolated and tested for incorporation of the six PTUs with restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. \\n     Example 2.10 \\n     Construction of pDAB101477 \\n     pDAB101477 is a binary plasmid that was constructed to contain rebuilt, codon optimized versions of SzPUFA OrfA v3, SzPUFA OrfB v3, hSzThPUFA OrfC v3, and NoHetI v3. The pDAB101477 plasmid ( FIG. 11 ; SEQ ID NO:39) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB101477 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one acyl-CoA synthetase PTU, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU. Specifically, the first PUFA synthase PTU contains the PvDlec2 promoter v2, 2S 5\u2032 UTR, SzPUFA OrfA v3 and At2S SSP terminator v1. The second PUFA synthase PTU contains the PvDlec2 promoter v2, 2S 5\u2032 UTR, SzPUFA OrfB v3 and At2S SSP terminator v1. The third PUFA synthase PTU contains the PvDlec2 promoter v2, 2S 5\u2032 UTR, hSzThPUFA OrfC v3 and At2S SSP terminator v1. The acyl-CoA synthetase PTU contains the PvDlec2 promoter v2, 2S 5\u2032 UTR, SzACS-2 v4 gene and At2S SSP terminator v1. The phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU contains the PvDlec2 promoter v2, 2S 5\u2032 UTR, NoHetI v3 and At2S SSP terminator v1. \\n     Plasmids pDAB7334, pDAB7335, pDAB7336, pDAB101472 and pDAB7333 were recombined to form pDAB101477.

The disarmed  Agrobacterium  strain DA2552 (U.S. Appl. No. 61/368,965, filed Jul. 29, 2010) carrying the binary vectors described above as pDAB7362 was used to initiate transformation. \\n       Agrobacterium -mediated transformation was carried out using a modified \u00bd cotyledonary node procedure of Zeng et al. (Zeng P., Vadnais D. A., Zhang Z., Polacco J. C., (2004), Plant Cell Rep., 22(7): 478-482). Briefly, soybean seeds (cv. Maverick) were germinated on basal media and cotyledonary nodes were isolated and infected with  Agrobacterium . Shoot initiation, shoot elongation, and rooting media were supplemented with cefotaxime, timentin and vancomycin for removal of  Agrobacterium . Glufosinate selection was employed to inhibit the growth of non-transformed shoots. Selected shoots were transferred to rooting medium for root development and then transferred to soil mix for acclimatization of plantlets. \\n     Terminal leaflets of selected plantlets were treated topically (leaf paint technique) with glufosinate to screen for putative transformants. The screened plantlets were transferred to the greenhouse, allowed to acclimate and then leaf-painted with glufosinate to reconfirm tolerance. These putative transformed T 0  plants were sampled and molecular analyses was used to confirm the presence of PAT, and the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI transgenes. To plants were allowed to self-fertilize in the greenhouse to produce T 1  seed. \\n     A second soybean transformation method was used to produce additional transgenic soybean plants. The disarmed  Agrobacterium  strain DA2552 (U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 61/368,965) carrying the binary vector described above as pDAB7362 was used to initiate transformation. \\n       Agrobacterium -mediated transformation was carried out using a modified half-seed procedure of Paz et al., (M. Paz, J. Martinez, A. Kalvig, T. Fonger, and K. Wang (2005) Plant Cell Rep., 25: 206-213). Briefly, mature soybean seeds were sterilized overnight with chlorine gas, and imbibed with sterile H 2 O twenty hours before  Agrobacterium -mediated plant transformation. Seeds were cut in half by a longitudinal cut along the hilum to separate the seed and remove the seed coat. The embryonic axis was excised and any axial shoots/buds were removed from the cotyledonary node. The resulting half seed explants were infected with  Agrobacterium . Shoot initiation, shoot elongation, and rooting media were supplemented with cefotaxime, timentin and vancomycin for removal of  Agrobacterium . Glufosinate selection was employed to inhibit the growth of non-transformed shoots. Selected shoots were transferred to rooting medium for root development and then transferred to soil mix for acclimatization of plantlets. \\n     Terminal leaflets of selected plantlets were treated topically (leaf paint technique) with glufosinate to screen for putative transformants. The screened plantlets were transferred to the greenhouse, allowed to acclimate and then leaf-painted with glufosinate to reconfirm tolerance. These putative transformed T 0  plants were sampled and molecular analyses was used to confirm the presence of PAT, and the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI transgenes. Seven events were identified as containing the transgenes from pDAB7362. These T 0  plants were advanced for further analysis and allowed to self-fertilize in the greenhouse to give rise to T 1  seed. \\n     Example 4 \\n     Molecular Analysis of Soybean Events \\n     Transgene copy numbers of selected pDAB7362 soybean events were quantified using a comparative quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) method. Leaf tissue samples were taken from the top and bottom leaves of a mature soybean plant, these samples were combined and the genomic DNA was isolated. Genomic DNA was isolated using the BioSprint 96 DNA Plant Kit and a BioSprint 96 magnetic particle automation platform (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) per manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Extracted genomic DNA was diluted 1:5 with ddH20 for use as template in quantitative real time PCR reactions (qPCR). \\n     qPCR Assays were designed to detect the SzPUFA OrfA v3, SzPUFA OrfB v3, hThSzPUFA OrfCv3, SzACS-2 v3, NoHetI v3, and PAT v5 transgenes in pDAB7362 soybean plants by using the Roche Assay Design Center (www.universalprobelibrary.com). The primers and probes used in the assays are described in Table 8. The presences of the target genes were detected with fluorescein-amidite (FAM) labeled UPL probes (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Ind.). These assays were executed in duplex reactions with a soybean internal reference GMFL01-25-J19, GenBank: AK286292.1 (referenced as GMS 116 in Table 8), which was labeled with the Cyanine-5 (Cy-5) fluorescent dye. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE\\u20038 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n

standard protocols. Data for the SzPUFA OrfA v3, SzPUFA OrfB v3, hThSzPUFA OrfCv3, SzACS-2 v3, NoHetI v3, and PAT v5, FAM-labeled assays were collected using a 533 nm emission filter and a 483 nm excitation signal. Data for the GMS1.16 Cy5-labeled reference assay was collected using a 660 nm filter and a 618 nm excitation signal. Crossing point values (Cp values) and target to reference ratios were calculated automatically using the LC480II software&#39;s \u201cAdvanced Relative Quantification\u201d analysis workflow. A target-to-reference ratio for each sample was calculated using the standard \u201cdelta-delta-Ct\u201d method. Estimated copy number was determined by normalizing sample target-reference ratios with the target-reference ratio of the soybean internal reference GMFL01-25-J19. \\n     The estimated copy number of the PAT v5 selectable marker and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) transgenes (SzPUFA OrfA v3, SzPUFA OrfB v3, hThSzPUFA OrfC v3, SzACS-2 v3, and NoHetI v3) was determined in T 1  plants from the seven pDAB7362 events. Plants from two events, 7362[710]-71006 and 7362[710]-71010, did not contain either the PAT v5 selectable marker or the DHA gene target sequences. Plants from the remaining events; 7362[710]-70903, 7362[710]-71005, 7362[710]-71008, and 7362[710]-71009, contained the PAT v5 selectable marker and the five DHA transgenes with copy numbers ranging from 1-10. Event 7362[708]-70801 produced T1 plants with 0, 1 or 2 copies of the PAT v5 gene indicating a single segregating locus and event 7362 [710]-71005 produced T1 plants with PAT v5 copy numbers between 0 and 4 suggesting segregation of two unlinked loci. \\n     Example 5 \\n     Lipid Analysis of T 1  Cotyledons of Transgenic Soybean Plants \\n     To avoid destructive analysis of limited quantities of T 1  seeds, fatty acid methyl ester (FAMEs) analysis was performed on post-germination green cotyledons of T 1  plants. Methods for the purification and analysis of FAMEs have been described (e.g., Z. D. Nightingale et al. (1999), Purification of fatty acid methyl esters by high-performance liquid chromatography,  J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl.  732(2):495-500; and \u201cGas chromatography and lipids: a practical guide\u201d by W. W Christie, 1989, The Oily Press). Characterization of the oil profile in the T 1  cotyledons is indicative of the oil profile in dry T 1  seed (R. F. Wilson and P. Kwanyuen (1986), Triacylglycerol synthesis and metabolism in germinating soybean cotyledons,  Biochimica et Biophysica Acta  ( BBA )\u2014 Lipids and Lipid Metabolism,  877(2):231-237). \\n     Example 5.1 \\n     Validation of Post-Germination Detection of DHA in T 1  Cotyledons Via Analysis of Transgenic Canola \\n     Validation and detection of Long Chain Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acids (LC-PUFA) in post-germination green cotyledons was performed with DHA-producing canola seed to assess if characterization of the oil profile in the T 1  cotyledons is indicative of the presence of an oil profile within the mature T 1  seed. Transgenic canola seed harboring the binary plasmid, pDAB7362, were germinated at room temperature on water-saturated paper towels, and harvested after 3 days at which point the tissue was lyophilized. The tissue was directly transmethylated and not pre-extracted with hexane. The LC-PUFA content (% FAMEs by weight) was calculated and compared to the mature seed. The average DHA content from the 30 canola emerged cotyledons was 0.71% (total LC-PUFA=0.97%) with an oil content of 53.0%. The average DHA content of 48 mature canola seed prior to germination was 0.49% (total LC-PUFA=0.73%) with an oil content of 44.3%. This study demonstrates that LC-PUFAs can be detected post-germination in emerged green cotyledons and that detection of the LC-PUFAs in emerged green cotyledons indicates that LC-PUFA is present in the seed. \\n     Example 5.2 \\n     Post-Germination Detection of DHA in T 1  Soybean Cotyledons \\n     FAME analysis was performed on one excised green cotyledon per soybean seedling sampled 3 to 5 days after planting. The plant material was lyophilized, homogenized using a steel ball and ball mill and defatted 3 times with hexane. The pooled hexane fraction was evaporated and the dry residue was weighed and reconstituted in heptane. A known amount of oil residue was transmethylated with 0.25 M of freshly prepared sodium methoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) in methanol in the presence of the surrogate, triheptadecanoin (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, Minn.). The reaction was conducted under mild heat (40\u00b0 C.) and constant shaking and the resulting FAMEs extracted with heptane. Completion of the reaction was verified by recovery of the reacted heptadecanoate methyl-ester surrogate. The FAMEs extracts were analyzed by GC-FID using an Agilent 6890 Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) and a 15 m\u00d70.25 mm\u00d70.25 \u03bcm BPX 70 capillary column from SGE (Austin, Tex.). Each FAME peak was identified by its retention time and quantified by the injection of a rapeseed oil reference mix from Matreya LLC (Pleasant Gap, Pa.). The calibration standard contained individually added standards of DHA, EPA and DPA(n-6) methyl esters from Nu-Chek. Data analysis was performed using ChemStation4 software (Agilent). T 1  cotyledons from two events contained DHA; pDAB7362[708]-70801.001 and pDAB7362[710]-71005.001 (Table 9). \\n     Forty seeds from Event pDAB7362[708]-70801.001 were germinated and screened for the presence of LC-PUFA in excised green cotyledon. Cotyledons from six of the forty seeds contained LC-PUFA in a range of 0.78% to 1.58% (with a mean of 1.12%). DHA content ranged from 0.48% to 0.93% (with a mean of 0.68%), and DP A (n-6) content ranged from 0.3% to 0.65% (with a mean of 0.44%). \\n     Thirty-nine seeds from Event pDAB7362[710]-71005.001 were germinated and screened for the presence of LC-PUFA in excised green cotyledon. Cotyledons from thirty-seven of the thirty-nine seeds contained LC-PUFA in a range of 0.70% to 1 1.98% (with a mean of 3.91%). Of the total LC-PUFA, DHA content ranged from 0.36% to 8.00% (with a mean of 2.24%), and DPA(n-6) content ranged from 0.34% to 3.98% (with a mean of 1.68%). \\n     Identification of LC-PUFA was confirmed by evaluating specific fragmentation of standard PUFA methyl esters (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, Minn.) using a Pegasus III GC-TOF-MS (Leco, St. Joseph, Mich.) compared to a negative control. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 9 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 LC-PUFA content by weight percentage of total fatty acids from \\n               \\n               \\n                 germinated T 1  soybean seed cotyledons \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n                   \\n                 # of DHA \\n                   \\n                   \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n                 # of total \\n                 positive \\n                 DHA \\n                 DPA(n-6) \\n                 Total PUFA \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Event ID \\n                 seedlings \\n                 seedlings \\n                 Mean \\n                 Range \\n                 Mean \\n                 Range \\n                 Mean \\n                 Range \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[708]-70801.001 \\n                 40 \\n                 6 \\n                 0.68% \\n                 0.48-0.93% \\n                 0.44% \\n                 \\u20020.3-0.65% \\n                 1.12% \\n                 0.78-1.58%\\u2002 \\n               \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[710]-71005.001 \\n                 39 \\n                 37 \\n                 2.24% \\n                 0.36-8.00% \\n                 1.68% \\n                 0.34-3.98% \\n                 3.91% \\n                 0.70-11.98% \\n               \\n               \\n                 Williams 82 control \\n                 15 \\n                 0 \\n                 \\u2003\\u20090% \\n                 \u2014 \\n                 \\u2003\\u20090% \\n                 \u2014 \\n                 \\u2003\\u20090% \\n                 \u2014 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     Example 6 \\n     Lipid Analysis of Mature T 2  Seed from Transgenic Soybean Events \\n     T 1  plants from two events, 7362[708]-70801.001 and 7362[710]-71005.001, were grown to maturity in the greenhouse. Plants were selected that contained high levels of LC-PUFAs in the T 1  cotyledon and one or two copies of PAT v5 and the accompanying five genes for DHA production. These plants were self-fertilized and the resulting T 2  seed harvested at maturity. Single seeds were analyzed via FAMEs GC-FID to determine the LC-PUFA and DHA content in the T 2  soybean seed. Twelve whole mature seeds per plant were individually analyzed by crushing the seed with a press and homogenization using a steel ball and ball mill. The tissue was defatted three times with hexane, the pooled hexane fractions were evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed and reconstituted in heptane for FAME analysis performed as described in the previous example. \\n     Single T 2  seeds from a T 1  plant of event 7362[708]-70801.001 (described as 7362[708]-70801.Sx.021 in  FIG. 12 ) that possessed a single copy of PAT v5 contained 0% to 0.73% DHA (0% to 1.19% total LC-PUFA). Single T 2  seeds from two T 1  plants of event 7362[710]-71005.001 (described as 7362[710]-71005.Sx.006 and 7362[710]-71005.Sx.0.35 in  FIG. 12 ) possessing a single copy of PAT v5 contained 0% to 2.08% DHA (0% to 3.56% total LC-PUFA). Single T 2  seeds from seven T 1  plants of event 7362[710]-71005.001 (described as 7362[710]-71005.Sx.010, 7362[710]-71005.Sx.012, 7362[710]-71005.Sx.013, 7362[710]-71005.Sx.016, 7362[710]-71005.Sx.018, 7362[710]-71005.Sx.025, and 7362[710]-71005 Sx.031 in  FIG. 12 ) containing two copies of PAT v5 contained 0% to 2.84% DHA (0% to 4.77% total LC-PUFA). The mean DHA content of T 2  seeds from the highest DHA-producing line (7362[710]-71005.Sx.025) was 1.83% (3.11% total LC-PUFA). The DHA content of each T 2  seed from the individual T 1  plants is shown in  FIG. 12 . \\n     DHA comprised 60% of the total LC-PUFA content in those T 2  seeds that contained LC-PUFA. Only the two novel LC-PUFAs, DHA and DPA(n-6), were detected in the T 2  soybean seeds. The fatty acids that are expected to be found in soybean seeds were detected at normal levels, except that total CI 8 fatty acids were proportionally lower due to the presence of LC-PUFAs. No other different fatty acids were detected in these transgenic soybean seeds other than DHA and DPA(n-6). The oil content (sum of the masses of the individual FAMEs divided by seed mass) of the transgenic seeds and the number of seeds produced by the transgenic T 1  lines was not significantly different from that of the nontransgenic Williams 82 control cultivar grown in the greenhouse at the same time under the same conditions. \\n     The complete FAMEs profiles of individual T 2  seeds from soybean events 7362[708]-70801.001 and 7362[710]-71005.001 are shown in Table 10. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 10 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 FAMEs profiles of individual T 2  soybean seeds from two events 7362[708]-70801.001 and \\n               \\n               \\n                 7362[710]-71005.001.

Two T 2  soybean plant events, 7362[708]-70801.001 and 7362[710]-71005.001, were grown to maturity in the greenhouse. Multiple plants of each event were grown in the greenhouse, and were screened to identify individual plants that produced high levels of LC-PUFAs in the T 2  cotyledon and contained a single, homozygous insertion of the transgenes. Identified plants were self-fertilized and the resulting T 3  seed was harvested when the seed reached maturity. Single mature T 3  seeds were analyzed via FAMEs GC-FID to determine the DHA and LC-PUFA content in the T 3  soybean seed ( FIG. 12 a   ). Twelve whole mature seeds per plant were individually analyzed by crushing the seed with a press and homogenizing the crushed seed material using a steel ball and ball mill. The tissue was defatted three times with hexane, the pooled hexane fractions were evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed and reconstituted in heptane for FAME analysis performed as described in the previous example. The DHA levels were determined from the T 3  seed and compared to the T 2  DHA levels, which had been assayed previously (Table 11). \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n               \\n                 TABLE 11 \\n               \\n             \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n               \\n                 Average DHA content (%) from randomly chosen mature soybean seed \\n               \\n               \\n                 at the T2 and T3 generation from two events 7362[708]70801.001 and \\n               \\n               \\n                 7362[710]-71005.001. \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                   \\n                 T 2  seed \\n                 T 3  seed \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 Event Name \\n                 n\\u2003 \\n                 Mean \\n                 Min \\n                 Max \\n                 n\\u2003 \\n                 Mean \\n                 Min \\n                 Max \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n               \\n            \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[708]70801.001-1-21 \\n                 9 \\n                 0.22 \\n                 0 \\n                 0.73 \\n                 90 \\n                 0.27 \\n                 0 \\n                 0.93 \\n               \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[710]71005.001-1-13 \\n                 12 \\n                 1.79 \\n                 0.82 \\n                 2.59 \\n                 45 \\n                 2.11 \\n                 0.79 \\n                 3.91 \\n               \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[710]71005.001-1-18 \\n                 12 \\n                 1.58 \\n                 0.79 \\n                 2.32 \\n                 48 \\n                 2.00 \\n                 1.05 \\n                 3.54 \\n               \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[710]71005.001-1-25 \\n                 12 \\n                 1.83 \\n                 0.99 \\n                 2.84 \\n                 39 \\n                 2.02 \\n                 0.99 \\n                 4.24 \\n               \\n               \\n                 pDAB7362[710]71005.001-1-35 \\n                 12 \\n                 0.59 \\n                 0 \\n                 2.08 \\n                 72 \\n                 0.74 \\n                 0 \\n                 3.10 \\n               \\n               \\n                 Williams 82 Control \\n                 8 \\n                 0 \\n                 0 \\n                 0 \\n                 15 \\n                 0 \\n                 0 \\n                 0 \\n               \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n            \\n           \\n         \\n       \\n     \\n     As indicated in Table 11, the relative percentage of DHA in soybean seeds remained constant or increased in subsequent generations of soybean (from the T 2  and T 3 ). Single T 3  seeds produced from self-fertilization of a T 2  plant of event 7362[708]-70801.001 (this line was molecularly characterized and found to possess a single hemizygous copy of PAT) were assayed via the FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 0.93% DHA (0% to 1.37% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T 2  seeds produced from event 7362[708]-70801.001 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 0.73% DHA. Single T 3  seeds from self-fertilization of a T 2  plant event 7362[710]-71005.001-1-35 (this line was molecularly characterized and found to possess a single hemizygous copy of PAT) were assayed via the FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain 0% to 3.10% DHA (0% to 5.45% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T 2  seeds produced from event 7362[710]-71005.001-1-35 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 2.84% DHA. In addition, Single T 3  seeds produced from events 7362[710]-71005.001-1-13, 7362[710]-71005.001-1-18, and 7362[710]-71005.001-1-25 (each event was determined to contain a single, homozygous copy of PAT) contained 0.79% to 4.24% DHA (1.26% to 6.5% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T 2  seeds produced from events 7362[710]-71005.001-1-13, 7362[710]-71005.001-1-18, and 7362[710]-71005.001-1-25 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0.79% to 2.84% DHA. The transgenic events were compared to the control plants, the yield per plant (number of seed) and total oil content (%) was found to be similar to the Williams 82 control in similar conditions as the transgenic lines. \\n     For all lines tested, the percentage of DHA and LC-PUFA that was produced and measured in the soybean seed for the T 2  and T 3  generations was either consistent or increased in levels from the T 2  generation to the T 3  generation. These results indicate that the traits are heritable, and that the transmission of the traits to further generations does not result in reduced DHA production. \\n     Example 7 \\n     Western Blot Detection of PUFA Synthase Proteins in Transgenic Soybean Seed \\n     PUFA synthase OrfA (encoded by SzPUFA OrfA v3 gene), PUFA synthase OrfB (encoded by SzPUFA OrfB v3 gene) PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC (encoded by hThSzPUFA OrfC v3 gene) and HetI (from  Nostoc  sp. PCC 7120, GenBank ID: P37695, GL20141367) were detected in mature transgenic seed samples by Western blot analysis. Residual soybean T 2  seed cake samples were retained after the hexane extraction for FAME analysis. The powdered seed cake was placed in a tube with a single 4.5 mm stainless steel ball and extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 2% SDS) was added. The sample tubes were rocked gently for 30 minutes, centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3,000 rcf and the supernatant was used for analysis. The amount of total soluble protein in the seed extract was determined by 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, Ill.). Samples were normalized to 1.25 mg/ml total soluble protein and prepared in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with 50 mM DTT for a normalized load of 16.25 \u03bcg total soluble protein per lane. Samples were electrophoresed in 3%-8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for detection of PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC. Samples were electroporesed in 4%-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for detection of HetI. \\n     Blots were incubated in blocking buffer then probed with antibodies against the different PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, and HetI polypeptides. The rabbit anti-A2-A that is directed against the A2 region of  Schizochytrium  PUFA Synthase OrfA (SzPUFS-A), the rabbit anti-B3-A that is directed against the B3 region of  Schizochytrium  PUFA Synthase OrfB (SzPUFS-B), and the rabbit anti-HetI that is directed against the full length HetI polypeptide were used. Region B3 includes the Enoyl Reductase (ER) domain of OrfB. As there is also a homologous ER domain in PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, this antiserum recognizes both PUFA synthase OrfB and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC on a western blot. An anti-rabbit fluorescent labeled secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit AF 633 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.)) was used for detection. Blots were visualized on a Typhoon Trio Plus fluorescent imager (GE Healthcare, New Brunswick N.J.). \\n     SDS-PAGE western blots of proteins extracts from mature T 2  seed from events 7362[708]-70801 and 7362[710]-71005 showed bands at the appropriate size when probed with PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, and HetI specific antisera ( FIG. 13 ). The bands for PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC could also be seen by direct staining with Coomassie Blue. \\n     Example 8 \\n     Expression of the Algal PUFA Synthase Gene Suite Using Alternative Promoters \\n     The use of additional transcriptional regulatory elements to express the gene(s) encoding PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins can further increase LC-PUFA and DHA content within soybean seeds. Identification and use of transcriptional regulatory elements that express earlier in development during triacylglycerol biosynthesis and deposition, and for extended periods of time can increase the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed by promoting transcription of a LC-PUFA and DHA biosynthetic genes at earlier stages of seed development (e.g., at 15 to 25 DAP) and therefore extend the time of LC-PUFA and DHA production. Examples of such transcriptional regulatory regions include, but are not limited to, the  Lesquerella fendleri  KCS (LfKCS3) promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 7,253,337) and the FAE 1 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 6,784,342) and the  Brassica oleracea  Acyl Carrier Protein (BoACP) promoter (International Publ. No. WO 1992/18634). In addition, other seed specific promoters such as the phaseolin promoter from  Phaseolus vulgaris  (U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,200) can be used to robustly drive expression of heterologous genes for extended periods of time during seed development to increase the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed. Finally, strong constitutive promoters such as the Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus promoter (CsVMV promoter v2) can be used to drive expression of the heterologous genes throughout all stages of development, thereby increasing the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed and other plant tissues. \\n     These promoters are used singularly or in combination to drive the expression of the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes, which were previously described in plasmid, pDAB7362. Methods to replace transcriptional regulatory regions within a plasmid are well known within the art. As such, a polynucleotide fragment comprising the PvDlec2 promoter v2 is removed from pDAB7362 (or the preceding plasmids used to build pDAB7362) and replaced with new promoter regions. The newly constructed plasmids are used to stably transform soybean plants. Transgenic soybean plants are isolated and molecularly characterized.

Several review articles discuss Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS) and Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS), such as those of Waterhouse I., 2001 (Nature 411:834-842), Vaucheret and Fagard, 2001 (Trends in Genetics 17(1):29-35, and Okamoto and Hirochika, 2001 (Trends in Plant Sci. 6 (11): 527-534). In plants, gene silencing can be triggered by the duplication of transgenic polynucleotide sequences (tandem repeat transgene sequences, inverted repeat transgene sequences, or multiple insertions into the chromosome) or when a sequence homologous to the target gene sequences is carried either by an infecting plant virus or by the T-DNA of  Agrobacterium tumefaciens.    \\n     In addition, the duplication of transgene polynucleotide sequences can act as triggers for construct instability. Multiple transgene sequences that share high levels of sequence similarity can fold back on one another. Rearrangements can occur via homologous recombination, wherein intervening sequences of DNA are excised. As a result, fragments of DNA that are located between repeated transgene polynucleotide sequences are excised. \\n     One strategy in designing plasmid vectors is to introduce promoter diversity into a construct by incorporating multiple, unique seed specific promoters that maintain high level expression of each transgene. Introducing promoter sequence diversity into the plasmid vectors can reduce gene silencing and improve plasmid stability. Multiple seed specific promoters include PvDlec2, Phaseolin, and Napin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,152). These promoters are relatively comparable in promoter activity such as tissue specificity, levels of expression, duration of expression, etc. \\n     Example 9.1 \\n     Construction of pDAB7733 \\n     The pDAB7733 binary plasmid ( FIG. 25 ; SEQ ID NO:51) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB7733 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

SzPUFA OrfA is a large open reading frame (\u02dc8,700 b.p.) containing nine tandem acyl carrier protein repeats. In the first series of completed constructs, the SzPUFA OrfA PTU was positioned to be integrated first into the plant chromosome. The SzPUFA OrfA PTU was subsequently followed by the remaining PUFA synthesis-related gene PTUs as they decreased in molecular size. Molecular analysis of the SzPUFA OrfA coding region indicated that some transgenic canola and  Arabidopsis thaliana  events contained fragmented insertions. Alternative Construct Designs are described, wherein the order of the PUFA synthase PTUs has been changed to the following configuration; hSzThPUFA OrfC PTU, SzPUFA OrfB PTU, NoHetI PTU, SzPUFA OrfA PTU, and PAT PTU. Changing the location of the SzPUFA OrfA PTU on the binary construct is completed to reduce fragmentation and rearrangement in isolated transgenic events. \\n     Example 9.7 \\n     Construction of pDAB9151 \\n     The pDAB9151 plasmid ( FIG. 31 ; SEQ ID NO:57) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB9151 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

In the first series of completed constructs, each gene expression cassette was positioned in the same direction (\u201chead to tail,\u201d wherein the promoter of one gene expression cassette is located adjacent to the 3\u2032 UTR of a second gene expression cassette). The following constructs describe a strategy wherein, gene expression cassettes are positioned in different directions, and utilize alternative promoters. In these examples, the gene expression cassette is located in trans to a second gene expression cassette such that the promoters of both gene expression cassettes are engineered adjacent to one another. This configuration is described as a \u201chead-to-head\u201d configuration. Other configurations are described in the examples, wherein one gene expression cassettes is located in trans to a second gene expression cassette such that the 3\u2032 UTRs of both gene expression cassettes are engineered adjacent to one another. This configuration is described as a \u201ctail-to-tail\u201d configuration. To mitigate potential read-through of such a design, the bidirectional Orf 23/24 terminator has been placed between these two PTUs. These configurations are proposed to increase expression of the transgenes, thereby resulting in higher concentrations and content of LC-PUFA and DHA fatty acid. \\n     Example 9.8 \\n     Construction of pDAB108207 \\n     The pDAB108207 plasmid ( FIG. 32 ; SEQ ID NO:58) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB108207 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

This phenomenon results from transcriptional read-through of the 3\u2032 UTR and terminator into the next promoter-transcription unit. Alternative construct designs consisting of two strategies to minimize transcriptional interference and transcriptional interference are described. The first strategy deploys the use of two terminator/3\u2032 UTRs, which are stacked between individual DHA gene expression cassettes to limit read-through into the next gene expression cassette.

These binary vectors are individually used to transform plants that are sexually crossed, thereby resulting in progeny that contain all of the PUFA synthase gene expression constructs.

Transgenic soybean plants are isolated and molecularly characterized. The use of alternative constructs result in soybean plants that contain greater amounts of DHA and LC-PUFAs. The resulting LC-PUFA accumulation is determined and soybean plants that produce 0.01% to 15% DHA or 0.01% to 15% LC-PUFA are identified. \\n     Example 10 \\n     Alternative Construct Designs Used for Transformation of  Arabidopsis thaliana  and Subsequent Production of LC-PUFA and DHA \\n       Arabidopsis thaliana  plants were transformed with  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strains containing the pDAB101493, pDAB7362, pDAB7369, pDAB101412, or pDAB7380 binary vectors. A floral dipping transformation protocol described by Clough and Bent (1998) was used for the transformation. Clough and Bent, \u201cFloral dip: a simplified method for  agrobacterium -mediated transformation of  Arabidopsis thalia ,\u201d Plant J., 16:735-743, 1998. Transformed  Arabidopsis  plants were obtained and molecular confirmation of the transgene presence was completed. T 1  plants from the transgenic  Arabidopsis  events were grown to maturity in the greenhouse. These plants were self-fertilized and the resulting T 2  seed harvested at maturity, T 2  seeds (10 mg) were analyzed via FAMEs GC-FID to determine the LC-PUFA and DHA content in the T 2    Arabidopsis  seed. The tissue was analyzed via the FAMEs GC-FID method as described in the previous examples. T 2  seeds from a T 1  plant of the  Arabidopsis  plants contained from 0% to 0.95% DHA and 0% to 1.50% total LC-PUFA. The LC-PUFA and DHA content of the T 2  seed from individual T 1  plants is shown in  FIG. 39 . \\n     Example 11 \\n     Co-Expression of DGAT2 or ACCase with the Algal PUFA Synthase Gene Suite within Soybean \\n     Oil content within soybean plants is further modified by transformation of chimeric DNA molecules that encode and express an acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) or a type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT2). These genes are co-expressed with the algal PUFA synthase genes described above, either through breeding soybean plants containing the ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassette with soybean plants containing the PUFA synthase genes; or by transforming soybean plants with a gene stack containing the ACCase or DGAT2 and the PUFA synthase genes. Regulatory elements necessary for expression of an ACCase or DGAT2 coding sequence can include those described above. Additional regulatory elements expression sequences known in the art may also be used. The ACCase and DGAT2 expression cassettes are transformed into soybean using transformation protocols described above. Transformation may occur as molecular stacks of the ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassette combined with the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes; or as independent ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassettes linked to a selectable marker and then subsequently crossed with soybean plants that contain the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes. Positive transformants are isolated and molecularly characterized. Soybean plants are identified that contain increased accumulation of LC-PUFAs in the plant, the seed of the plant, or plant oil concentrations compared to untransformed control soybean plants. Such increases can range from a 1.2 to a 20-fold increase. \\n     The over-expression of ACCase in the cytoplasm may produce higher levels of malonyl-CoA, Soybean plants or seed containing increased levels of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA may produce subsequently higher levels of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) when the algal PUFA synthase genes are present and expressed. DGAT2 genes that are expressed within soybean plants may be capable of preferentially incorporating significant amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into triacylglycerol. DGAT2 genes with substrate preference toward LC-PUFAs (see, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 2009/085169 A2) may increase incorporation of these fatty acids into triacylglycerol (TAG). Such DGAT genes are useful for directing the incorporation of LC-PUFA, particularly DHA, into TAG and for increasing the production of TAG in plants and other organisms. \\n     Example 12 \\n     Production of DHA in  Arabidopsis  Seeds Transformed with Alternative Construct Designs for Expression of PUFA Synthase Genes \\n       Arabidopsis  T 1  events transformed with  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  harboring plasmids encoding PUFA synthase genes and HetI (and in some cases SzACS-2) under the control of various plant expression elements were generated using the floral dip method essentially as described in Clough and Bent (Plant J., 1998 16(6):735-43). The resulting T 1  seed was harvested and sown. Transformed T 1  plants were selected by spraying with phosphinothricin to select for those plants containing a functional PAT gene as a selectable marker. Leaf tissue from the surviving T 1  plants was sampled and analyzed by quantitative PCR reactions specific for the PAT gene to identify those plants containing a single copy of the selectable marker (and associated transgenes). These plants were grown to maturity, the T 2  seed harvested and analyzed for LC-PUFA content (as % of total extractable FAMEs). A summary of data from the events generated with various constructs encoding PUFA synthase genes is shown in Table 12. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n               \\n             \\n

generate a higher proportion of events containing LC-PUFA in the T 2  seed (77% of all single copy events for pDAB109507 produced DHA, and 86% of all single copy events for pDAB108207 produced DHA). Also certain constructs generate a higher proportion of events producing &gt;1% LC-PUFA content (33% of all single copy events for pDAB109507, and 34% of all single copy events for pDAB108207). The maximum LC-PUFA content of the T 2  seed from the various events ranged from 0.24%-2.03% for the different constructs. Likewise, certain constructs produce higher levels of omega-3 LC-PUFAs. The maximum DHA content ranged from 0.17%-1.45% and the maximum EPA content ranged from 0%-0.26% across all the constructs and events generated. These data indicate that the alteration of the construct design where promoter configurations were changed resulted in transgenic plants that exhibit increased LC-PUFA, as compared to transgenic plants that were transformed with pDAB7362. As such, these constructs in which the construct design was altered are desirable for crop transformations. \\n     T 2  seed from high LC-PUFA producing events was planted and the leaf tissue from the growing plants was sampled using quantitative PCR to assay the PAT gene and other transgenes. Plants containing two copies of the transgenes (i.e., homozygotes) were identified and grown to maturity. The resulting T 3  seed was harvested and analyzed for LC-PUFA content. Some constructs such as pDAB7362 and pDAB109509, which contained repeated promoter/3\u2032 UTR expression elements, showed poor stability of the LC-PUFA trait in the subsequent T 3  seed generation. However, some events transformed with different construct configurations and/or diversified expression elements (e.g., pDAB108207, 109508 and 7734) produced significantly improved stability of the LC-PUFA trait into the T 3  seed generation, as shown in Table 13. These data indicate that certain constructs can maintain stability of the DHA trait in subsequent generations and that such constructs are preferred for crop transformations. \\n     \\n       \\n

Field of the Invention</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">The present invention generally relates to recombinant host organisms (e.g., plants) genetically modified with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase system and one or more accessory proteins that allow for and/or improve the production of PUFAs in the host organism. The present invention also relates to methods of making and using such organisms (e.g., to obtain PUFAs) as well as products obtained from such organisms (e.g., oil and seed).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">2. Background Art</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are considered to be useful for nutritional applications, pharmaceutical applications, industrial applications, and other purposes. However, the current supply of PUFAs from natural sources (e.g., fish oils) and from chemical synthesis is not sufficient for long-term commercial needs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Vegetable oils derived from plants (e.g., oil seed crops) are relatively inexpensive and do not have the contamination issues associated with fish oils. However, the PUFAs found in commercially-developed plants and plant oils do not typically include more saturated or longer-chain PUFAs, and only typically include fatty acids such as linoleic acid (eighteen carbons with 2 double bonds, in the delta 9 and 12 positions\u201418:2 delta 9,12) and linolenic acid (18:3 delta 9,12,15).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">The production of more unsaturated or longer-chain PUFAs in plants by the modification of the fatty acids endogenously produced by plants has been described. For example, the genetic modification of plants with various individual genes encoding fatty acid elongases and/or desaturases has been described as resulting in the generation of leaves or seeds containing significant levels of longer-chain and more unsaturated PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but also containing significant levels of mixed shorter-chain and less unsaturated PUFAs (Qi et al., Nature Biotech. 22:739 (2004); WO 04/071467; Abbadi et al., Plant Cell 16:1 (2004); Napier and Sayanova, Proceedings of the Nutrition Society 64:387-393 (2005); Robert et al., Functional Plant Biology 32:473-479 (2005); U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682, U.S. Appl. No. 61/345,537, filed May 17, 2010).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Fabaceae (or Leguminosae) is a large and economically important family of flowering plants, which is commonly known as the legume family, pea family, bean family or pulse family. <i>Glycine </i>is a genus in the family Fabaceae and includes, for example, <i>Glycine </i>albicans, <i>Glycine aphyonota, Glycine arenari, Glycine argyrea, Glycine canescens, Glycine clandestine, Glycine curvata, Glycine cyrtoloba, Glycine falcate, Glycine gracei, Glycine hirticaulis, Glycine hirticaulis </i>subsp. <i>leptosa, Glycine lactovirens, Glycine latifolia, Glycine latrobeana, Glycine microphylla, Glycine montis</i>-<i>douglas, Glycine peratosa, Glycine pescadrensis, Glycine pindanica, Glycine pullenii, Glycine rubiginosa, Glycine stenophita, Glycine syndetika, Glycine tabacina, Glycine tomentella, Glycine soja</i>, and <i>Glycine max </i>(soybean). The family Fabaceae also includes peanut, beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), broad beans (<i>Vicia faba</i>) or peas (<i>Pisum sativum</i>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">The majority of soybean oil is in the form of vegetable oils produced for human consumption. There is also a growing market for the use of soybean oil in industrial applications.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">There is a need in the art for a relatively inexpensive method to efficiently and effectively produce quantities (e.g., commercial quantities) of longer-chain or more unsaturated PUFAs in plants, plant seed or plant oil, as well as quantities of lipids (e.g., triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid (PL)) enriched in such PUFAs in plants, plant seed or plant oil. A system for providing and improving PUFA production in host organisms (e.g., plants) by providing recombinant host organisms genetically modified with a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase and one or more accessory proteins, as described herein, is a significant alternative to the approaches in the art.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">The present invention is directed to genetically modified plants (e.g., plants of the family Fabaceae or the genus <i>Glycine </i>such as soybean), descendants, seeds, cells, tissues, or parts thereof, comprising (i) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase (e.g., an algal PUFA synthase) that produces at least one PUFA; and (ii) a nucleic acid sequence encoding a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that transfers a phosphopantetheinyl cofactor to an PUFA synthase system (e.g., an algal PUFA synthase system) ACP domain.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">In some embodiments of the present invention, the PUFA synthase comprises an amino acid sequence that is 80% to 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.

\u201cpolyunsaturated fatty acid\u201d or \u201cPUFA\u201d as used herein refers to fatty acids with a carbon chain length of at least 16 carbons, at least 18 carbons, at least 20 carbons, or 22 or more carbons, with at least 3 or more double bonds, 4 or more double bonds, 5 or more double bonds, or 6 or more double bonds, wherein all double bonds are in the cis configuration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">The term \u201clong chain polyunsaturated fatty acids\u201d or \u201cLC-PUFAs\u201d as used herein refers to fatty acids of 20 and more carbon chain length, containing 3 or more double bonds, or 22 or more carbons, with at least 3 or more double bonds, 4 or more double bonds, 5 or more double bonds, or 6 or more double bonds. LC-PUFAs of the omega-6 series include, but are not limited to, di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid (C20:3n-6), arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6), adrenic acid (also called docosatetraenoic acid or DTA) (C22:4n-6), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-6). LC-PUFAs of the omega-3 series include, but are not limited to, eicosatrienoic acid (C20:3n-3), eicosatetraenoic acid (C20:4n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3), docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3). LC-PUFAs also include fatty acids with greater than 22 carbons and 4 or more double bonds including but not limited to C28:8(n-3).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">The term \u201cPUFA synthase\u201d as used herein refers to an enzyme that produces polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and particularly, long chain PUFAs (LC-PUFAs) as well as any domain of such an enzyme in a complex. The teen PUFA synthase includes, but is not limited to, PUFA PKS systems or PKS-like systems for the production of PUFAs. Some specific PUFA synthases are designated herein by an additional notation, e.g., \u201cSzPUFA\u201d synthase or \u201chSzThPUFA\u201d synthase, as defined in the application. The term \u201cPUFA synthase system\u201d includes a PUFA synthase and any accessory enzymes that can affect the function of the PUFA synthase when expressed in a heterologous organism (e.g., a PPTase or ACS).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">The terms \u201cphosphopantetheinyl transferase\u201d and \u201cPPTase\u201d as used herein refer to an enzyme that activates a PUFA synthase by transferring a cofactor (e.g., 4-phosphopantetheine) from coenzyme A (CoA) to one or more ACP domains present in the PUFA synthase. One example of a PPTase that can activate one or more ACP domains of a PUFA synthase described herein is the Het I protein of <i>Nostoc </i>sp. PCC 7120 (formerly called <i>Anabaena </i>sp. PCC 7120), designated herein as \u201cNoHetI.\u201d</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">The terms \u201cacyl-CoA synthetase,\u201d \u201cACoAS\u201d and \u201cACS\u201d as used herein refer to an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of long chain polyunsaturated free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl-CoA. Some specific acyl-CoA synthetases are designated herein by an additional notation, e.g., \u201cSzACS-2,\u201d as defined in the application.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">The term \u201cplant\u201d as used herein includes any descendant, cell, tissue, seed, seed oil, or part thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">\u201cNutraceutical\u201d means a product isolated, purified, concentrated, or produced from plants that provides a physiological benefit or provides protection against disease, including processed foods supplemented with such products, along with foods produced from crops that have been genetically engineered to contain enhanced levels of such physiologically-active components.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">\u201cFunctional food\u201d means a food that (a) is similar in appearance to or can be a conventional food that is consumed as part of a usual diet and (b) has enhanced nutritional value and/or specific dietary benefits based on a modification in the proportion of components that typically exist in the unmodified food.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">The terms \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and \u201cnucleic acid\u201d are intended to encompass a singular nucleic acid as well as plural nucleic acids, a nucleic acid molecule or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, or construct, e.g., messenger RNA (mRNA) or plasmid DNA (pDNA). A polynucleotide or nucleic acid can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA sequence, or a fragment thereof, including the untranslated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences and the coding sequences. A polynucleotide or nucleic acid can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxyribonucleotide, which can be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, a polynucleotide or nucleic acid can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that can be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. These terms also embrace chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms of a polynucleotide or nucleic acid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">A polynucleotide or nucleic acid sequence can be referred to as \u201cisolated\u201d in which it has been removed from its native environment. For example, a heterologous polynucleotide or nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment having dihydroxy-acid dehydratase activity contained in a vector is considered isolated for the purposes of the present invention. Further examples of an isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid include recombinant polynucleotides maintained in heterologous host cells or a purified (partially or substantially) polynucleotide or nucleic acid in solution. An isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid according to the present invention further includes such molecules produced synthetically. An isolated polynucleotide or nucleic acid in the form of a polymer of DNA can be comprised of one or more segments of cDNA, genomic DNA or synthetic DNA.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">The term \u201cgene\u201d refers to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof that is capable of being expressed as a specific protein, optionally including regulatory sequences preceding (5\u2032 non-coding sequences) and following (3\u2032 non-coding sequences) the coding sequence.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">As used herein, the term \u201ccoding region\u201d refers to a DNA sequence that codes for a specific amino acid sequence. \u201cSuitable regulatory sequences\u201d refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5\u2032 non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3\u2032 non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence and that influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences can include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, polyadenylation recognition sequences, RNA processing site, effector binding site, and stem-loop structure.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">As used herein, the terms \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is intended to encompass a singular \u201cpolypeptide\u201d as well as plural \u201cpolypeptides\u201d and fragments thereof, and refers to a molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide bonds (also known as peptide bonds). The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to any chain or chains of two or more amino acids, and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, dipeptides, tripeptides, oligopeptides, protein, amino acid chain, or any other term used to refer to a chain or chains of two or more amino acids, are included within the definition of \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d and the term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d can be used instead of, or interchangeably with any of these terms. A polypeptide can be derived from a natural biological source or produced by recombinant technology, but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It can be generated in any manner, including by chemical synthesis.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">By an \u201cisolated\u201d polypeptide or a fragment, variant, or derivative thereof is intended a polypeptide that is not in its natural milieu. No particular level of purification is required. For example, an isolated polypeptide can be removed from its native or natural environment. Recombinantly produced polypeptides and proteins expressed in host cells are considered isolated for purposes of the invention, as are native or recombinant polypeptides that have been separated, fractionated, or partially or substantially purified by any suitable technique.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0079\">As used herein, \u201cnative\u201d refers to the form of a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide as found in nature with its own regulatory sequences, if present.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0080\">As used herein, \u201cendogenous\u201d refers to the native form of a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide in its natural location in the organism or in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous polynucleotide\u201d includes a native polynucleotide in its natural location in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous gene\u201d includes a native gene in its natural location in the genome of an organism. \u201cEndogenous polypeptide\u201d includes a native polypeptide in its natural location in the organism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0081\">As used herein, \u201cheterologous\u201d refers to a polynucleotide, gene or polypeptide not normally found in the host organism but that is introduced into the host organism. \u201cHeterologous polynucleotide\u201d includes a native coding region, or portion thereof, that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native polynucleotide. \u201cHeterologous gene\u201d includes a native coding region, or portion thereof, that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native gene. For example, a heterologous gene can include a native coding region that is a portion of a chimeric gene including non-native regulatory regions that is reintroduced into the native host. \u201cHeterologous polypeptide\u201d includes a native polypeptide that is reintroduced into the source organism in a form that is different from the corresponding native polypeptide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0082\">As used herein, the term \u201cmodification\u201d refers to a change in a polynucleotide disclosed herein that results in reduced, substantially eliminated or eliminated activity of a polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide, as well as a change in a polypeptide disclosed herein that results in reduced, substantially eliminated or eliminated activity of the polypeptide. Such changes can be made by methods well known in the art, including, but not limited to, deleting, mutating (e.g., spontaneous mutagenesis, random mutagenesis, mutagenesis caused by mutator genes, or transposon mutagenesis), substituting, inserting, down-regulating, altering the cellular location, altering the state of the polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g., methylation, phosphorylation or ubiquitination), removing a cofactor, introduction of an antisense RNA/DNA, introduction of an interfering RNA/DNA, chemical modification, covalent modification, irradiation with UV or X-rays, homologous recombination, mitotic recombination, promoter replacement methods, and/or combinations thereof. Guidance in determining which nucleotides or amino acid residues can be modified, can be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polynucleotide or polypeptide with that of homologous polynucleotides or polypeptides, e.g., yeast or bacterial, and maximizing the number of modifications made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or consensus sequences.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0083\">The term \u201cderivative\u201d as used herein, refers to a modification of a sequence disclosed in the present invention. Illustrative of such modifications would be the substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of one or more bases relating to a nucleic acid sequence of a coding sequence disclosed herein that preserve, slightly alter, or increase the function of a coding sequence disclosed herein in oil seed crop species. Such derivatives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, for example, using computer modeling techniques for predicting and optimizing sequence structure. The term \u201cderivative\u201d thus also includes nucleic acid sequences having substantial sequence homology with the disclosed coding sequences herein such that they are able to have the disclosed functionalities for use in producing LC-PUFAs of the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0084\">As used herein, the term \u201cvariant\u201d refers to a polypeptide differing from a specifically recited polypeptide of the invention by amino acid insertions, deletions, mutations, and substitutions, created using, e.g., recombinant DNA techniques, such as mutagenesis. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues can be replaced, added, or deleted without abolishing activities of interest, can be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polypeptide with that of homologous polypeptides and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or by replacing amino acids with consensus sequences.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0085\">Alternatively, recombinant polynucleotide variants encoding these same or similar polypeptides can be synthesized or selected by making use of the \u201credundancy\u201d in the genetic code. Various codon substitutions, such as silent changes that produce various restriction sites, can be introduced to optimize cloning into a plasmid or viral vector for expression. Mutations in the polynucleotide sequence can be reflected in the polypeptide or domains of other peptides added to the polypeptide to modify the properties of any part of the polypeptide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0086\">Amino acid \u201csubstitutions\u201d can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements, or they can be the result of replacing one amino acid with an amino acid having different structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., non-conservative amino acid replacements. \u201cConservative\u201d amino acid substitutions can be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Alternatively, \u201cnon-conservative\u201d amino acid substitutions can be made by selecting the differences in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, or the amphipathic nature of any of these amino acids. \u201cInsertions\u201d or \u201cdeletions\u201d can be within the range of variation as structurally or functionally tolerated by the recombinant proteins. The variation allowed can be experimentally determined by systematically making insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids in a polypeptide molecule using recombinant DNA techniques and assaying the resulting recombinant variants for activity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0087\">The term \u201cpromoter\u201d refers to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3\u2032 to a promoter sequence. Promoters can be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters can direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental or physiological conditions. Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as \u201cconstitutive promoters.\u201d It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths can have identical promoter activity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0088\">The term \u201coperably linked\u201d refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (e.g., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0089\">The term \u201cexpression\u201d as used herein, refers to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from the nucleic acid fragment of the invention. Expression can also refer to translation of mRNA into a polypeptide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0090\">The term \u201coverexpression\u201d as used herein, refers to expression that is higher than endogenous expression of the same or related gene. A heterologous gene is overexpressed if its expression is higher than that of a comparable endogenous gene.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0091\">As used herein, the term \u201ctransformation\u201d refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid or fragment into a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as \u201ctransgenic\u201d or \u201crecombinant\u201d or \u201ctransformed\u201d organisms.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0092\">The terms \u201cplasmid\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d as used herein refer to an extra chromosomal element often carrying genes that are not part of the central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Such elements can be autonomously replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or nucleotide sequences, linear or circular, of a single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction that is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3\u2032 untranslated sequence into a cell.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0093\">As used herein, the term \u201ccodon degeneracy\u201d refers to the nature in the genetic code permitting variation of the nucleotide sequence without affecting the amino acid sequence of an encoded polypeptide. The skilled artisan is well aware of the \u201ccodon-bias\u201d exhibited by a specific host cell in usage of nucleotide codons to specify a given amino acid. Therefore, when synthesizing a gene for improved expression in a host cell, it is desirable to design the gene such that its frequency of codon usage approaches the frequency of preferred codon usage of the host cell.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0094\">The term \u201ccodon-optimized\u201d as it refers to genes or coding regions of nucleic acid molecules for transformation of various hosts refers to the alteration of codons in the gene or coding regions of the nucleic acid molecules to reflect the typical codon usage of the host organism without altering the polypeptide encoded by the DNA. Such optimization includes replacing at least one, more than one, or a significant number of codons with one or more codons that are more frequently used in the genes of that organism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">Deviations in the nucleotide sequence that comprise the codons encoding the amino acids of any polypeptide chain allow for variations in the sequence coding for the gene. Since each codon consists of three nucleotides, and the nucleotides comprising DNA are restricted to four specific bases, there are 64 possible combinations of nucleotides, 61 of which encode amino acids (the remaining three codons encode signals ending translation). The \u201cgenetic code\u201d that shows which codons encode which amino acids are reproduced herein in the table below. As a result, many amino acids are designated by more than one codon. For example, the amino acids alanine and proline are coded for by four triplets, serine and arginine by six, whereas tryptophan and methionine are coded by just one triplet. This degeneracy allows for DNA base composition to vary over a wide range without altering the amino acid sequence of the proteins encoded by the DNA.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">The

of a particular amino acid in a growing peptide chain. Codon preference, or codon bias, differences in codon usage between organisms, is afforded by degeneracy of the genetic code, and is well documented among many organisms. Codon bias often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, inter alia, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0098\">Given the large number of gene sequences available for a wide variety of animal, plant and microbial species, it is possible to calculate the relative frequencies of codon usage. Codon usage tables are readily available and can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>28:292 (2000). By utilizing this or similar tables, one of ordinary skill in the art can apply the frequencies to any given polypeptide sequence, and produce a nucleic acid fragment of a codon-optimized coding region that encodes the polypeptide, but uses codons optimal for a given species. The present invention pertains to codon optimized forms of OrfA, OrfB, chimeric OrfC, PPTase and/or other accessory proteins of the invention, as described further herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0099\">The term \u201cpercent identity\u201d as known in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, \u201cidentity\u201d also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as the case can be, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. \u201cIdentity\u201d and \u201csimilarity\u201d can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to those disclosed in: 1) Computational Molecular Biology (A. M. Lesk, Ed.) Oxford University: NY (1988); 2) Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects (D. W. Smith, Ed.) Academic: NY (1993); 3) Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I (A. M. Griffin and H. G. Griffin, Eds.) Humania: NJ (1994); 4) Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology (G. von Heinje, Ed.) Academic (1987); and 5) Sequence Analysis Primer (M. Gribskov and J. Devereux, Eds.) Stockton: NY (1991).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0100\">Methods to determine identity are designed to give the best match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity and similarity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations can be performed, for example, using the AlignX program of the Vector NTI\u00ae suite (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or M<smallcaps>EG</smallcaps>A<smallcaps>LIGN</smallcaps>\u2122 program of the LASERGENE\u00ae bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, Wis.). Multiple alignment of the sequences is performed using the \u201cClustal method of alignment,\u201d which encompasses several varieties of the algorithm including the \u201cClustal V method of alignment\u201d corresponding to the alignment method labeled Clustal V (disclosed by Higgins and Sharp, <i>CABIOS. </i>5:151-153 (1989); D. G. Higgins, et al., <i>Comput. Appl. Biosci., </i>8:189-191 (1992)) and found in the M<smallcaps>EG</smallcaps>A<smallcaps>LIGN</smallcaps>\u2122 program of the LASERGENE\u00ae bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR, Inc.). For multiple alignments, the default values correspond to GAP PENALTY=10 and GAP LENGTH PEN ALT Y=10. Default parameters for pairwise alignments and calculation of percent identity of protein sequences using the Clustal method are KTUPLE-T, GAP PENALTY-3, WTNDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5. For nucleic acids these parameters are KTUPLE-2, GAP PENALTY-5, WINDOW=4 and DIAGONALS SAVED=4. After alignment of the sequences using the Clustal V program, it is possible to obtain a \u201cpercent identity\u201d by viewing the \u201csequence distances\u201d table in the same program. Additionally the \u201cClustal W method of alignment\u201d is available and corresponds to the alignment method labeled Clustal W (described by Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS. 5:151-153 (1989); D. G. Higgins, et al., Comput. Appl.

Default parameters for multiple alignment (GAP PENALTY\u2122 10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=0.2, Delay Divergen Seqs(%)=30, DNA Transition Weight=0.5, Protein Weight Matrix=Gonnet Series, DNA Weight Matrix=IUB). After alignment of the sequences using the Clustal W program, it is possible to obtain a \u201cpercent identity\u201d by viewing the \u201csequence distances\u201d table in the same program.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0101\">The term \u201csequence analysis software\u201d refers to any computer algorithm or software program that is useful for the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. \u201cSequence analysis software\u201d can be commercially available or independently developed.

In some embodiments, a recombinant host can be, but is not limited to, any higher plant, including both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, and consumable plants, including crop plants and plants used for their oils. Thus, any plant species or plant cell can be selected as described further below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0104\">The oils of the present invention can also be used in non-culinary or dietary processes and compositions. Some of these uses can be industrial, cosmetic or medical. Oils of the present invention can also be used in any application for which the oils of the present invention are suited. In general, the oils of the present invention can be used to replace, e.g., mineral oils, esters, fatty acids, or animal fats in a variety of applications, such as lubricants, lubricant additives, metal working fluids, hydraulic fluids and fire resistant hydraulic fluids. The oils of the present invention can also be used as materials in a process of producing modified oils. Examples of techniques for modifying oils of the present invention include fractionation, hydrogenation, alteration of the oil&#39;s oleic acid or linolenic acid content, and other modification techniques known to those of skill in the art.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0105\">Examples of cosmetic uses for oils of the present invention include use as an emollient in a cosmetic composition; as a petroleum jelly replacement; as comprising part of a soap, or as a material in a process for producing soap; as comprising part of an oral treatment solution; as comprising part of an ageing treatment composition; and as comprising part of a skin or hair aerosol foam preparation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0106\">Additionally, the oils of the present invention can be used in medical applications. For example, oils of the present invention can be used in a protective barrier against infection, and oils high in omega-9 fatty acids can be used to enhance transplant graft survival (U.S. Pat.

The pathway for synthesis of long chain PUFAs via a PUFA synthase has also been described and is very different from the \u201cstandard\u201d pathway. Specifically, PUFA synthases utilize malonyl-CoA as a carbon source and produce the final PUFA without releasing intermediates in any significant amount. Also, with PUFA synthases, the appropriate cis double bonds are added during the synthesis using a mechanism that does not require oxygen. In some embodiments, NADPH is used as a reductant during the synthesis cycles.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0109\">The present invention relates to host organisms (e.g., plants such as soybean) that have been genetically modified to express a PUFA synthase (either endogenously or by genetic manipulation). In some embodiments, an organism that has been genetically modified to express a PUFA synthase, wherein the organism does not naturally (endogenously, without genetic modification) express such an enzyme, or at least that particular PUFA synthase or portion thereof with which the organism is being genetically modified, can be referred to herein as a \u201cheterologous\u201d host organism with regard to the modification of the organism with the PUFA synthase or with another protein that is not endogenously expressed by the organism. The genetic modifications of the present invention can be used to improve PUFA production in a host organism that endogenously expresses a PUFA synthase, where the organism is not further modified with a different PUFA synthase or a portion thereof.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0110\">A PUFA synthase according to the present invention can comprise several multifunctional proteins (and can include single function proteins, particularly for PUFA synthase from marine bacteria) that can act together to conduct both iterative processing of the fatty acid chain as well as non-iterative processing, including trans-cis isomerization and enoyl reduction reactions in selected cycles. These proteins can also be referred to herein as the core PUFA synthase enzyme complex or the core PUFA synthase. The general functions of the domains and motifs contained within these proteins are individually known in the art and have been described in detail with regard to various PUFA synthases from marine bacteria and eukaryotic organisms (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,486; U.S. Pat. No. 6,566,583; Metz et al., Science 293:290-293 (2001); U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2002/0194641, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,461, issued Jul. 24, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0235127, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,211,418, issued May 1, 2007; U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2005/0100995, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,856, issued May 15, 2007; and WO 2006/135866).

In particular, the ACP domains present in the PUFA synthase enzymes require activation by attachment of a cofactor (4-phosphopantetheine) from coenzyme A to the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Attachment of this cofactor is carried out by PPTases. If the endogenous PPTases of the host organism are incapable of activating the PUFA synthase ACP domains, then it is necessary to provide a PPTase that is capable of carrying out that function. The sequences of many PPTases are known, and crystal structures have been determined (e.g., Reuter et al., EMBO J. 18:6823-31 (1999)) as well as mutational analysis of amino acid residues important for activity (Mofid et al., Biochemistry 43:4128-36 (2004)).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0147\">One example of a heterologous PPTase that has been demonstrated previously to recognize the OrfA ACP domains described herein as substrates is the Het I protein of <i>Nostoc </i>sp.

The two ACP domains of Hgl E have a high degree of sequence homology to the ACP domains found in <i>Schizochytrium </i>Orf A and other PUFA synthases.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0148\">In some embodiments, a PUFA synthase can be considered to include at least one 4\u2032-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) domain, or such a domain can be considered to be an accessory domain or protein to the PUFA synthase.

The present invention also relates to methods to improve or enhance the effectiveness of such genetic modification and particularly, to improve or enhance the production and/or accumulation of the end product of a PUFA synthase, e.g., PUFAs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0163\">Methods for gene expression in a genetically modified organism, including, but not limited to plants, are known in the art. In some embodiments, the coding region for the PUFA synthase genes to be expressed can be codon optimized for the target host cell as described below. Expression of genes in recombinant host cells including, but not limited to, plant cells, can require a promoter operably linked to a coding region of interest, and/or a transcriptional terminator. A number of promoters can be used in constructing vectors for genes, including but not limited to a seed-specific promoter (e.g., PvDlec2, LfKCS3, FAE 1, BoACP, or BnaNapinC) or a leaf-specific promoter (e.g., ubiquitin or CsVMV). Other non-limiting examples of promoters that can be used in the present invention include the acyl carrier protein promoter disclosed in WO 1992/18634; the <i>Phaseolus vulgaris </i>beta-phaseolin promoter and truncated versions disclosed in Slightom et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80: 1897-1901; 1983); Sengupta-Gopalan et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 82: 3320-3324; 1985); van der Geest et al. (Plant Mol. Biol. 33: 553-557; 1997), and Bustos et al. (EMBO J. 10: 1469-1479; 1991).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0164\">In some embodiments of the present invention, a recombinant vector is an engineered (e.g., artificially produced) nucleic acid molecule that is used as a tool for manipulating a nucleic acid sequence of choice and for introducing such a nucleic acid sequence into a host cell. The recombinant vector is therefore suitable for use in cloning, sequencing, and/or otherwise manipulating the nucleic acid sequence of choice, such as by expressing and/or delivering the nucleic acid sequence of choice into a host cell to form a recombinant cell. Such a vector typically contains heterologous nucleic acid sequences, that is nucleic acid sequences that are not naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid sequence to be cloned or delivered, although the vector can also contain regulatory nucleic acid sequences (e.g., promoters, untranslated regions) that are naturally found adjacent to nucleic acid molecules of the present invention or that are useful for expression of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. The vector can be either RNA or DNA, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, and typically is a plasmid. The vector can be maintained as an extrachromosomal element (e.g., a plasmid) or it can be integrated into the chromosome of a recombinant organism (e.g., a microbe or a plant). The entire vector can remain in place within a host cell, or under certain conditions, the plasmid DNA can be deleted, leaving behind the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention. The integrated nucleic acid molecule can be under chromosomal promoter control, under native or plasmid promoter control, or under a combination of several promoter controls. Single or multiple copies of the nucleic acid molecule can be integrated into the chromosome. A recombinant vector of the present invention can contain at least one selectable marker.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0165\">In some embodiments, a recombinant vector used in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is an expression vector. In such embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence encoding the product to be produced (e.g., a PUFA synthase) is inserted into the recombinant vector to produce a recombinant nucleic acid molecule. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein to be produced is inserted into the vector in a manner that operatively links the nucleic acid sequence to regulatory sequences in the vector that enable the transcription and translation of the nucleic acid sequence within the recombinant host cell.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0166\">Vectors useful for the transformation of a variety of host organisms and cells are common and disclosed in the literature. Typically the vector contains a selectable marker and sequences allowing autonomous replication or chromosomal integration in the desired host. In addition, suitable vectors can comprise a promoter region that harbors transcriptional initiation controls and a transcriptional termination control region, between which a coding region DNA fragment can be inserted, to provide expression of the inserted coding region. Both control regions can be derived from genes homologous to the transformed host cell, although it is to be understood that such control regions can also be derived from genes that are not native to the specific species chosen as a production host.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0167\">The present invention includes the expression of one or more acyl-CoA synthetases as described and exemplified herein with a PUFA synthase as described herein and with an exogenous PPTase that are utilized alone or in combination with any one or more strategies described herein (e.g., any one, two, three, or four of: codon optimization, organelle-targeting, enhancement of PUFA synthase competition for malonyl CoA (e.g., by inhibition of FAS), and/or expression of one or more acyltransferases or related enzymes), to increase PUFA production and/or accumulation in a heterologous host.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0168\">Some embodiments of the invention relate to the targeting of expression of the PUFA synthase enzymes, the PPTase, and/or any one or more of the accessory proteins and/or targeted genetic modifications to one or more organelles of the host. For example, in some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase system and the PPTase can be targeted to the plastid of a plant. In some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase and the PPTase is targeted to the cytosol. In some embodiments, expression of the PUFA synthase and the PPTase is targeted to both the plastid and the cytosol of a plant. In any of these embodiments, other targets can be directed to the plastid or the cytosol.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0169\">In some embodiments, acyl-CoA synthetases are expressed in the cytosol to convert the DHA and/or other LC-PUFA free fatty acids to acyl-CoAs, which in turn can be utilized by the acyltransferases.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0170\">A variety of plastid targeting sequences are known in the art and can be used in embodiments where the heterologous host is a plant or plant cell, and wherein targeting to the plastid is desired.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0171\">The present invention includes the use of organelle targeting (e.g., to the plastid or chloroplast in plants) with expression of a PUFA synthase as described herein and with an exogenous PPTase, which are utilized alone or in combination with any one or more strategies described herein (e.g., any one, two, three, or four of: codon optimization, enhancement of PUFA synthase competition for malonyl CoA (e.g., by inhibition of FAS), expression of one or more acyl-CoA synthetases, and/or expression of one or more acyltransferases or related enzymes), to increase PUFA production and/or accumulation in a heterologous host.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0172\">The targeting of gene products to the plastid or chloroplast is controlled by a signal sequence found at the amino terminal end of various proteins, which is cleaved during import yielding the mature protein (e.g., with regard to chloroplast targeting, see, e.g., Comai et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:15104-15109 (1988)). These signal sequences can be fused to heterologous gene products to effect the import of heterologous products into the chloroplast (van den Broeck et al. Nature 313:358-363 (1985)). DNA encoding for appropriate signal sequences can be isolated from the cDNAs encoding the RUBISCO protein, the CAB protein, the EPSP synthase enzyme, the GS2 protein and many other proteins that are known to be chloroplast localized.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0173\">In some embodiments of the invention, the localization of proteins employed in the invention is directed to a subcellular compartment, for example, to the plastid or chloroplast. Proteins can be directed to the chloroplast by including at their amino-terminus a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP). Similarly, proteins can be directed to the plastid by including at their N-terminus a plastid transit or signaling peptide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0174\">Naturally occurring chloroplast targeted proteins, synthesized as larger precursor proteins containing an amino-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide directing the precursor to the chloroplast import machinery, are well known in the art. Chloroplast targeting peptides are generally cleaved by specific endoproteases located within the chloroplast organelle, thus releasing the targeted mature and can active enzyme from the precursor into the chloroplast milieu. Examples of sequences encoding peptides that are suitable for directing the targeting of the gene or gene product to the chloroplast or plastid of the plant cell include the petunia EPSPS CTP, the <i>Arabidopsis </i>EPSPS CTP2 and intron, and others known to those skilled in the art. Such targeting sequences provide for the desired expressed protein to be transferred to the cell structure in which it most effectively functions, or by transferring the desired expressed protein to areas of the cell in which cellular processes necessary for desired phenotypic function are concentrated. Specific examples of chloroplast targeting peptides are well known in the art and include the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit ats1A transit peptide, an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>EPSPS transit peptide, and a <i>Zea maize </i>ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit transit peptide.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0175\">An optimized transit peptide is described, for example, by van den Broeck et al., Nature, 313:358-363 (1985). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal sequences are disclosed, for example, by Michaelis et al., Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 36:425 (1982). Additional examples of transit peptides that can be used in the invention include the chloroplast transit peptides such as those described in Von Heijne et al., Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 9:104-126 (1991); Mazur et al., Plant Physiol. 85:1110 (1987); and Vorst et al., Gene 65:59 (1988). Chen &amp; Jagendorf (J. Biol. Chem. 268:2363-2367 (1993)) have described use of a chloroplast transit peptide for import of a heterologous transgene. This peptide used is the transit peptide from the rbcS gene from <i>Nicotiana plumbaginifolia </i>(Poulsen et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 205: 193-200 (1986)). One CTP that has functioned herein to localize heterologous proteins to the chloroplast was derived from <i>Brassica napus </i>acyl-ACP thioesterase.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0176\">An alternative means for localizing genes to chloroplast or plastid includes chloroplast or plastid transformation. Recombinant plants can be produced in which only the chloroplast DNA has been altered to incorporate the molecules envisioned in this application. Promoters that function in chloroplasts are known in the art (Hanley-Bowden et al., Trends in Biochemical Sciences 12:67-70 (1987)). Methods and compositions for obtaining cells containing chloroplasts into which heterologous DNA has been inserted have been described, for example, by Daniell et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,507) and Maliga et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,513).</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0012\">Combinations of Strategies</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0177\">According to the present invention, in the production of a heterologous host for the production and accumulation of one or more target PUFAs, any one or more (any combination) of the strategies described herein for improving the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs in the host can be used. Indeed, it is anticipated that various combinations of strategies will be additive or synergistic and provide improved production and/or accumulation of PUFAs as compared to in the absence of one or more such strategies. Indeed, the Examples provide exemplary strategies for the production of PUFAs in a host organism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0178\">Any plant or plant cell using these combinations of modifications, or any other modification or combination of modifications described herein, is encompassed by the invention. In some embodiments, such a plant has been further genetically modified to express an accessory protein as described herein for the improvement of the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs (or other bioactive products of the PUFA synthase) by the host (e.g., ACoAS, GPAT, LPAAT, DAGAT or acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase)). Furthermore, any host cell or organism using any modifications or combination of modifications described herein is encompassed by the invention, as are any products derived from such cell or organisms, including seed or oil comprising the target PUFAs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0179\">In some embodiments, plants to genetically modify according to the present invention (e.g., plant host cells) includes, but is not limited to, any higher plants, including both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants, and particularly consumable plants, including crop plants and especially plants used for their oils. Such plants can include, but are not limited to, for example: soybean, rapeseed, linseed, corn, safflowers, sunflowers and tobacco. Thus, any plant species or plant cell can be selected.

In some embodiments, the plant is peanut, beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), broad beans (<i>Vicia faba</i>) or peas (<i>Pisum sativum</i>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0180\">\u201cPlant parts,\u201d as used herein, include any parts of a plant, including, but not limited to, seeds (including mature seeds and immature seeds), pollen, embryos, flowers, fruits, shoots, leaves, roots, stems, explants, etc. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant has a genome that is modified (e.g., mutated or changed) from its normal (e.g., wild-type or naturally occurring) form such that the desired result is achieved (e.g., increased or modified PUFA synthase and/or production and/or accumulation of a desired product using the PUFA synthase). In some embodiments, genetic modification of a plant can be accomplished using classical strain development and/or molecular genetic techniques. Methods for producing a transgenic plant, wherein a recombinant nucleic acid molecule encoding a desired amino acid sequence is incorporated into the genome of the plant, are known in the art. In some embodiments, a plant to genetically modify according to the present invention is a plant suitable for consumption by animals, including humans.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0181\">Plant lines from these plants, optimized for a particularly desirable trait, e.g., disease resistance, ease of plant transformation, oil content or profile, etc., can be produced, selected or identified. In some embodiments, plant lines can be selected through plant breeding, or through methods such as marker assisted breeding and tilling. In some embodiments, plant cell cultures can be used and, for example, are not grown into differentiated plants and cultivated using ordinary agricultural practices, but instead grown and maintained in a liquid medium.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0182\">In some embodiments, the plant can be an oil seed plant, wherein the oil seeds, and/or the oil in the oil seeds contain PUFAs produced by the PUFA synthase. In some embodiments, such oils can contain a detectable amount of at least one target or primary PUFA that is the product of the PUFA synthase. In some embodiments, such oils can be substantially free of intermediate or side products that are not the target or primary PUFA products and that are not naturally produced by the endogenous FAS system in the wild-type plants (e.g., wild-type plants produce some shorter or medium chain PUFAs, such as 18 carbon PUFAs, via the FAS system, but there will be new, or additional, fatty acids produced in the plant as a result of genetic modification with a PUFA synthase).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0183\">With regard to the production of genetically modified plants, methods for the genetic engineering of plants are well known in the art.

In some embodiments, a plurality of plants can be generated. Methodologies for regenerating plants are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be found, for example, in: Plant Cell and Tissue Culture, 1994, Vasil and Thorpe Eds.

In some embodiments, a suitable growth medium for higher plants can include any growth medium for plants, including, but not limited to, soil, sand, any other particulate media that support root growth (e.g., vermiculite, perlite, etc.) or hydroponic culture, as well as suitable light, water and nutritional supplements that optimize the growth of the higher plant.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0195\">It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that use of recombinant DNA technologies can improve control of expression of transfected nucleic acid molecules by manipulating, for example, the number of copies of the nucleic acid molecules within the host cell, the efficiency with which those nucleic acid molecules are transcribed, the efficiency with which the resultant transcripts are translated, and the efficiency of post-translational modifications. Additionally, the promoter sequence might be genetically engineered to improve the level of expression as compared to the native promoter. Recombinant techniques useful for controlling the expression of nucleic acid molecules include, but are not limited to, integration of the nucleic acid molecules into one or more host cell chromosomes, addition of vector stability sequences to plasmids, substitutions or modifications of transcription control signals(e.g., promoters, operators, enhancers), substitutions or modifications of translational control signals (e.g., ribosome binding sites, Shine-Dalgarno sequences), modification of nucleic acid molecules to correspond to the codon usage of the host cell, and deletion of sequences that destabilize transcripts.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0198\" num=\"0196\">In some embodiments, a plant can include those plants that are known to produce compounds used as pharmaceutical agents, flavoring agents, nutraceutical agents, functional food ingredients or cosmetically active agents or plants that are genetically engineered to produce these compounds/agents.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0199\" num=\"0197\">All of these embodiments of the invention apply to the discussion of any of the genetically modified organisms and methods of producing and using such organisms as described herein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0200\" num=\"0000\">Products from Genetically Modified Organisms</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0201\" num=\"0198\">In some embodiments, a genetically modified organism of the invention produces one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), DP A (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), ARA (C20:4, n-6), GLA (CI 8:3, n-6), ALA (C18:3, n-3), and/or SDA (C18:4, n-3)), and in some embodiments, one or more longer-chain PUFAs, including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), DPA (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), or DTA (C22:4, n-6), or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant of the invention produces one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids including, but not limited to, EPA (C20:5, n-3), DHA (C22:6, n-3), and/or DPA (C22:5, n-6 or n-3), or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant of the invention does not have a high oleic background.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0202\" num=\"0199\">In some embodiments, a genetically modified organism is a plant that has been genetically modified to recombinantly express a PUFA synthase and a PPTase, as described herein. In some embodiments, such a plant has been genetically modified further to express an accessory protein as described herein for the improvement of the production and/or accumulation of PUFAs (or other bioactive products of the PUFA synthase) by the host (e.g., ACoAS, GPAT, LPAAT, DAGAT or ACCase).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0200\">Some embodiments of the present invention include the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids of desired chain length and with desired numbers of double bonds and, by extension, oil seed and oils obtained from the genetically modified plants described herein (e.g., obtained from the oil or seeds of such plants) comprising these PUFAs. Examples of PUFAs that can be produced by the present invention include, but are not limited to, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, n-3)), ARA (eicosatetraenoic acid or arachidonic acid (C20:4, n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5, n-6 or n-3)), and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3)), and any combinations thereof. The present invention allows for the production of commercially valuable lipids enriched in one or more desired (target or primary) PUFAs by the development of genetically modified plants through the use of a PUFA synthase that produces PUFAs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0201\">In some embodiments, a given PUFA synthase derived from a particular organism will produce particular PUFA(s), such that selection of a PUFA synthase from a particular organism will result in the production of specified target or primary PUFAs. In some embodiments, the ratio of the PUFAs can differ depending on the selection of the particular PUFA synthase and on how that system responds to the specific conditions in which it is expressed. For example, use of a PUFA synthase from <i>Thraustochytrium </i>23 B (ATCC No. 20892) can also result in the production of DHA and DPA(n-6) as the target or primary PUFAs; however, in the case of <i>Thraustochytrium </i>23B, the ratio of DHA to DPA(n-6) is 10:1 (and can range from 8:1 to 40:1), whereas in <i>Schizochytrium</i>, the ratio is typically 2.5:1. In some embodiments, a given PUFA synthase can be modified by intermixing proteins and domains from different PUFA synthases, or one can modify a domain or protein of a given PUFA synthase to change the target PUFA product and/or ratios.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0202\">In some embodiments, reference to \u201cintermediate products\u201d or \u201cside products\u201d of an enzyme system that produces PUFAs refers to any products, and particularly, fatty acid products, that are produced by the enzyme system as a result of the production of the target or primary PUFA(s) of the system, but that are not the primary or target PUFA(s). In some embodiments, intermediate and side products can include non-target fatty acids that are naturally produced by the wild-type plant, or by the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification, but are now classified as intermediate or side products because they are produced in greater levels as a result of the genetic modification, as compared to the levels produced by the wild-type plant, or by the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification. In some embodiments, a primary or target PUFA of one enzyme system can be an intermediate of a different enzyme system where the primary or target product is a different PUFA. For example, when using the standard pathway to produce EPA, fatty acids such as GLA, DGLA and SDA are produced as intermediate products in significant quantities (e.g., U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682). Similarly, and also illustrated by U.S. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0172682, when using the standard pathway to produce DHA, in addition to the fatty acids mentioned above, ETA and EPA (notably the target PUFA in the first example above) can be produced in significant quantities and can be present in significantly greater quantities relative to the total fatty acid product than the target PUFA itself.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0206\" num=\"0203\">In some embodiments, to produce significantly high yields of one or more desired polyunsaturated fatty acids, a plant can be genetically modified to introduce a PUFA synthase system into the plant. Plants are not known to endogenously contain a PUFA synthase, and therefore, the present invention represents an opportunity to produce plants with unique fatty acid production capabilities. The present invention provides genetically engineered plants to produce one or more PUFAs in the same plant, including, but not limited to, EPA, DHA, DPA (n3 or n6), ARA, GLA, SDA and others, including any combination thereof. The present invention offers the ability to create any one of a number of \u201cdesigner oils\u201d in various ratios and forms. In some embodiments, the use of a PUFA synthase from the particular marine organisms described herein can extend the range of PUFA production and successfully produce such PUFAs within temperature ranges used to grow most crop plants.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0207\" num=\"0204\">In some embodiments, to be \u201csubstantially free\u201d of intermediate or side products of the system for synthesizing PUFAs, or to not have intermediate or side products present in substantial amounts, means that any intermediate or side product fatty acids (non-target PUFAs) that are produced in the genetically modified plant (and/or parts of plants and/or seed oil fraction) as a result of the introduction or presence of the enzyme system for producing PUFAs (e.g., that are not produced by the wild-type plant or the parent plant used as a recipient for the indicated genetic modification), can be present in a quantity that is less than 10% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 9% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 8% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 7% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 6% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 5% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 4% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 3% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 2% by weight of total fatty acids, less than 1% by weight of total fatty acids, or less than 0.5% by weight of total fatty acids.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0205\">In some embodiments, a genetically modified plant, descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof of the invention or an oil or seed obtained from a genetically modified plant, descendant, cell, tissue, or part thereof of the invention comprises detectable amounts of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6, n-3)), DPA(n-6) (docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5 n-6)) or EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, n-3)).

PCC 7120 (GenBank ID: P37695, GI:20141367) revealed the presence of several sequence motifs containing non-optimal codon compositions that may be detrimental to optimal plant expression. The design of the gene(s) encoding PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins was optimized to generate a DNA sequence that is more \u201cplant-like\u201d in nature, and in which the sequence modifications do not hinder translation or create mRNA instability through non-optimal codon composition.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0236\" num=\"0233\">Due to the plasticity afforded by the redundancy/degeneracy of the genetic code (e.g., some amino acids are specified by more than one codon), evolution of the genomes in different organisms or classes of organisms has resulted in differential usage of synonymous codons. This \u201ccodon bias\u201d is reflected in the mean base composition of protein coding regions. For example, organisms having genomes with relatively low G+C contents utilize more codons having A or T in the third position of synonymous codons, whereas those having higher G+C contents utilize more codons having G or C in the third position. Further, it is thought that the presence of \u201cminor\u201d codons within an mRNA may reduce the absolute translation rate of that mRNA, especially when the relative abundance of the charged tRNA corresponding to the minor codon is low. An extension of this reasoning is that the diminution of translation rate by individual minor codons would be at least additive for multiple minor codons. Therefore, mRNAs having high relative contents of minor codons would have correspondingly low translation rates. This rate would be reflected by correspondingly low levels of the encoded protein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0237\" num=\"0234\">In engineering genes encoding a PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI protein for expression in dicotyledonous plants (such as tobacco, soybean, cotton or canola), the codon usages for canola were accessed from publicly available databases (Table 1).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0238\" num=\"0000\">\\n      <tables id=\"TABLE-US-00002\" num=\"00002\">\\n        <patent-tables frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" pgwide=\"1\">\\n          <tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"1\">\\n            <colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"273pt\" align=\"center\"> </colspec>\\n            <patent-thead>\\n              <row>\\n                <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 1</entry>\\n              </row>\\n            </patent-thead>\\n            \\n              <row>\\n                <entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"> </entry>\\n              </row>\\n              <row>\\n                <entry>Synonymous codon representation in coding regions of dicotyledonous</entry>\\n              </row>\\n              <row>\\n                <entry>plants from <i>Brassica napus </i>(canola) genes (Columns C and G).

The sequence was then further analyzed and modified to reduce the frequency of TA or GC doublets.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0242\" num=\"0238\">Analysis of these sequences revealed that the new DNA sequences encoded essentially the amino acid sequence of the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins but were respectively designed for optimal expression in dicotyledonous plants using a balanced codon distribution of frequently used codons found in canola genes. In particular, the new DNA sequences differed from the original DNA sequences encoding an PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI by the substitution of plant (first preferred, second preferred, third preferred, or fourth preferred) codons to specify the appropriate amino acid at each position within the protein amino acid sequence.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0243\" num=\"0239\">Design of the plant-optimized DNA sequences were initiated by reverse-translation of the protein sequences of PUFA synthase OrfA (SEQ ID NO: 1), PUFA synthase OrfB (SEQ ID NO: 2), PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC (SEQ ID NO: 3), acyl-CoA synthetase (SEQ ID NO: 4) and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI (SEQ ID NO: 5) using a canola codon bias table constructed from Table 1, Columns D and H. The protein sequence for acyl-CoA synthetase (SEQ ID NO: 4) was altered from the original sequence; wherein the second amino acid Alanine was removed from the protein. The initial sequences were then modified by compensating codon changes (while retaining overall weighted average codon representation) to remove or add restriction enzyme recognition sites, remove highly stable intrastrand secondary structures, and remove other sequences that might be detrimental to cloning manipulations or expression of the engineered gene in plants. The DNA sequences were then re-analyzed for restriction enzyme recognition sites that might have been created by the modifications. The identified sites were further modified by replacing the relevant codons with first, second, third, or fourth choice preferred codons. Other sites in the sequences that could affect transcription or translation of the gene of interest include the exon:intron junctions (5\u2032 or 3\u2032), poly A addition signals, or RNA polymerase termination signals. The modified sequences were further analyzed and further modified to reduce the frequency of TA or CG doublets, and to increase the frequency of TG or CT doublets. In addition to these doublets, sequence blocks that have more than about six consecutive residues of [G+C] or [A+T] can affect transcription or translation of the sequence. Therefore, these sequence blocks were also modified by replacing the codons of first or second choice, etc. with other preferred codons of choice. Rarely used codons are not included to a substantial extent in the gene design, being used only when necessary to accommodate a different design criterion than codon composition per se (e.g., addition or deletion of restriction enzyme recognition sites).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0244\" num=\"0240\">The protein encoded by PUFA synthase OrfA comprises 10 repeated \u201cProline-Alanine\u201d domains ranging in size from 17 to 29 amino acids. Interspersed between the Proline-Alanine repeats were 9 longer repeated sequence domains comprising 87 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of these repeats vary at only 4 positions, and there were only two codon choices at each of the variant positions. Analyses of the amino acid sequences of the 9 repeats using the Clustal W computer program generated a homology value of 100%, and an identity value of 95.4%. At the DNA level, the sequences encoding the 9 repeats are 100%) homologous, 89.7% identical, varying at only 27 positions in the 261 bases encoding each repeat (23 of the 27 changes are \u201csilent\u201d differences, in which synonymous codons for the same amino acid are interchanged).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0245\" num=\"0241\">Standard gene design processes cannot easily accommodate developing new codon biased DNA sequences for multiple repeats of this size, since one must continually balance all the codon choices in an individual repeat with the codon choices made at the same position in the other 8 repeats, to avoid generating highly related DNA sequences. For each of the 87 residue repeats, there were more than 4.5\u00d710<sup>43 </sup>possible DNA sequences to encode the same amino acid sequence (calculated as the product of the number of synonymous codons for each amino acid in the sequence). Thus, there was a very large computing space available to generate identically-encoding DNA sequences. The following protocol describes a method used to generate (in silico) multiple sequence designs for each individual repeat, followed by comparison of all the sequence versions in bulk to identify a set that represents highly diverged sequences encoding the repeats:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0246\" num=\"0242\">Step 1: Extract the native DNA sequence encoding each repeated amino acid domain as a separate sequence.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0247\" num=\"0243\">Step 2: Import the individual repeated DNA sequences as separate sequences into a gene design program (e.g., OPTGENE\u2122, Ocimum Biosolutions, Hyderabad, India). Steps 3-5 are performed on each sequence separately.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0248\" num=\"0244\">Step 3: Translate the DNA sequence using the standard genetic code.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0249\" num=\"0245\">Step 4: Reverse translate the translated protein sequence using the standard genetic code and the appropriate codon bias table. In this example, a biased codon table compiled from 530 <i>Brassica napus </i>protein coding regions was used, and each generated sequence was code-named \u201cnap\u201d (for \u201cnapus\u201d) plus the version number. Thus, the first reverse-translated, codon biased sequence for Repeat 1 was named \u201crpt1 nap1.\u201d In this illustration, this process was performed 10 times, to generate 10 DNA sequence versions encoding the protein sequence of Repeat 1.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0250\" num=\"0246\">Step 5: Export the 10 sequence versions into the corresponding number of text files.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0251\" num=\"0247\">Step 6: Repeat Steps 3-5 for each of the other repeated sequence domains. In this illustration, a total of 90 \u201cnap\u201d sequence versions were generated (10 for each repeated element).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0252\" num=\"0248\">Step 7: Import the 90 sequence files into the Clustal W program Mega 3.1 (accessed at Megasoftware) and perform a multiple sequence alignment using all 90 sequences as input. Because these sequences are segments of protein coding regions, the alignments are performed with no gaps allowed. After Clustal W Alignment, a Neighbor-Joining tree is assembled and visualized, and one of the ten codon-optimized sequences for each of the nine repeated domains in the protein is picked visually. Each selected sequence version is chosen from a section of the tree that is the most deeply branched.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0253\" num=\"0249\">Step 8: The chosen sequence for each repeated domain is incorporated into the codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding the entire protein, in the proper position for each particular repeat.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0254\" num=\"0250\">Step 9: Final analyses of the entire codon optimized sequence, including the separately designed diverged repeat elements, are performed to assure the absence of undesired motifs, restriction enzyme recognition sites, etc.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0255\" num=\"0251\">Employing this method with the codon optimization of the PUFA synthase OrfA coding sequence resulted in the selection of repeated Proline-Alanine sequences that are sufficiently diverged to avoid repeated sequence instability. These sequences were chosen from the deepest branches of the Neighbor-Joining tree (i.e., are the most distantly related to one another in this sequence set). Smith-Wasserman global alignments were done for all pair wise combinations and the range of homology was 74-81% with a probable median of 76-77% (Table 2).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0256\" num=\"0000\">\\n

Restriction sites for the facilitation of cloning, a Kozak sequence and additional stop codons were added to the plant optimized coding sequence. In addition, a second series of PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI coding sequences were designed, which contained a chloroplast targeting sequence from the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>Ribulose Bisphosphate Carboxylase small chain 1A (GenBank ID: NM_202369.2). This sequence, SEQ ID NO: 28, was added to the previously described coding sequences for PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC and phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI. The initial Methionine from SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 10 was removed and replaced with the chloroplast targeting sequence. The sequences that contain the chloroplast targeting sequence are identified as version 4 (v4) throughout the specification.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0266\" num=\"0256\">A second chloroplast transit peptide was added to the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI coding sequences. These coding sequences were designed to contain a chloroplast targeting sequence from acyl-ACP-thioesterase (GenBank ID: X73849.1). This sequence, SEQ ID NO: 29, was added to the previously described coding sequences for PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC and phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI. The initial Methionine from SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 10 was removed and replaced with the chloroplast targeting sequence.

This version was labeled as \u201cSzACS-2 v4\u201d and listed as SEQ ID NO: 30.

Synthesis of DNA fragments comprising SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8. SEQ ID NO: 9 and SEQ ID NO: 10 containing the additional sequences described above were performed by commercial suppliers (Geneart Ag, Regensburg, Germany).

Briefly, mature soybean seeds were sterilized overnight with chlorine gas, and imbibed with sterile H<sub>2</sub>O twenty hours before <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated plant transformation. Seeds were cut in half by a longitudinal cut along the hilum to separate the seed and remove the seed coat. The embryonic axis was excised and any axial shoots/buds were removed from the cotyledonary node. The resulting half seed explants were infected with <i>Agrobacterium</i>. Shoot initiation, shoot elongation, and rooting media were supplemented with cefotaxime, timentin and vancomycin for removal of <i>Agrobacterium</i>.

This study demonstrates that LC-PUFAs can be detected post-germination in emerged green cotyledons and that detection of the LC-PUFAs in emerged green cotyledons indicates that LC-PUFA is present in the seed.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0047\">Example 5.2</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0048\">Post-Germination Detection of DHA in T<sub>1 </sub>Soybean Cotyledons</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0304\" num=\"0293\">FAME analysis was performed on one excised green cotyledon per soybean seedling sampled 3 to 5 days after planting. The plant material was lyophilized, homogenized using a steel ball and ball mill and defatted 3 times with hexane. The pooled hexane fraction was evaporated and the dry residue was weighed and reconstituted in heptane. A known amount of oil residue was transmethylated with 0.25 M of freshly prepared sodium methoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) in methanol in the presence of the surrogate, triheptadecanoin (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, Minn.). The reaction was conducted under mild heat (40\u00b0 C.) and constant shaking and the resulting FAMEs extracted with heptane. Completion of the reaction was verified by recovery of the reacted heptadecanoate methyl-ester surrogate. The FAMEs extracts were analyzed by GC-FID using an Agilent 6890 Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.) and a 15 m\u00d70.25 mm\u00d70.25 \u03bcm BPX 70 capillary column from SGE (Austin, Tex.). Each FAME peak was identified by its retention time and quantified by the injection of a rapeseed oil reference mix from Matreya LLC (Pleasant Gap, Pa.). The calibration standard contained individually added standards of DHA, EPA and DPA(n-6) methyl esters from Nu-Chek. Data analysis was performed using ChemStation4 software (Agilent). T<sub>1 </sub>cotyledons from two events contained DHA; pDAB7362[708]-70801.001 and pDAB7362[710]-71005.001 (Table 9).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0305\" num=\"0294\">Forty seeds from Event pDAB7362[708]-70801.001 were germinated and screened for the presence of LC-PUFA in excised green cotyledon. Cotyledons from six of the forty seeds contained LC-PUFA in a range of 0.78% to 1.58% (with a mean of 1.12%). DHA content ranged from 0.48% to 0.93% (with a mean of 0.68%), and DP A (n-6) content ranged from 0.3% to 0.65% (with a mean of 0.44%).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0306\" num=\"0295\">Thirty-nine seeds from Event pDAB7362[710]-71005.001 were germinated and screened for the presence of LC-PUFA in excised green cotyledon. Cotyledons from thirty-seven of the thirty-nine seeds contained LC-PUFA in a range of 0.70% to 1 1.98% (with a mean of 3.91%). Of the total LC-PUFA, DHA content ranged from 0.36% to 8.00% (with a mean of 2.24%), and DPA(n-6) content ranged from 0.34% to 3.98% (with a mean of 1.68%).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0307\"

Plants were selected that contained high levels of LC-PUFAs in the T<sub>1 </sub>cotyledon and one or two copies of PAT v5 and the accompanying five genes for DHA production. These plants were self-fertilized and the resulting T<sub>2 </sub>seed harvested at maturity. Single seeds were analyzed via FAMEs GC-FID to determine the LC-PUFA and DHA content in the T<sub>2 </sub>soybean seed. Twelve whole mature seeds per plant were individually analyzed by crushing the seed with a press and homogenization using a steel ball and ball mill. The tissue was defatted three times with hexane, the pooled hexane fractions were evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed and reconstituted in heptane for FAME analysis performed as described in the previous example.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0310\" num=\"0298\">Single T<sub>2 </sub>seeds from a T<sub>1 </sub>plant of event 7362[708]-70801.001 (described as 7362[708]-70801.Sx.021 in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12</figref>) that possessed a single copy of PAT v5 contained 0% to 0.73% DHA (0% to 1.19% total LC-PUFA).

of Mature T<sub>3 </sub>Seed from Two Transgenic Soybean Events</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0314\" num=\"0301\">Two T<sub>2 </sub>soybean plant events, 7362[708]-70801.001 and 7362[710]-71005.001, were grown to maturity in the greenhouse. Multiple plants of each event were grown in the greenhouse, and were screened to identify individual plants that produced high levels of LC-PUFAs in the T<sub>2 </sub>cotyledon and contained a single, homozygous insertion of the transgenes. Identified plants were self-fertilized and the resulting T<sub>3 </sub>seed was harvested when the seed reached maturity. Single mature T<sub>3 </sub>seeds were analyzed via FAMEs GC-FID to determine the DHA and LC-PUFA content in the T<sub>3 </sub>soybean seed (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 12<i>a</i> </figref>). Twelve whole mature seeds per plant were individually analyzed by crushing the seed with a press and homogenizing the crushed seed material using a steel ball and ball mill. The tissue was defatted three times with hexane, the pooled hexane fractions were evaporated to dryness and the residue weighed and reconstituted in heptane for FAME analysis performed as described in the previous example. The DHA levels were determined from the T<sub>3 </sub>seed and compared to the T<sub>2 </sub>DHA levels, which had been assayed previously (Table 11).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0315\" num=\"0000\">\\n

T<sub>3</sub>). Single T<sub>3 </sub>seeds produced from self-fertilization of a T<sub>2 </sub>plant of event 7362[708]-70801.001 (this line was molecularly characterized and found to possess a single hemizygous copy of PAT) were assayed via the FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 0.93% DHA (0% to 1.37% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T<sub>2 </sub>seeds produced from event 7362[708]-70801.001 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 0.73% DHA. Single T<sub>3 </sub>seeds from self-fertilization of a T<sub>2 </sub>plant event 7362[710]-71005.001-1-35 (this line was molecularly characterized and found to possess a single hemizygous copy of PAT) were assayed via the FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain 0% to 3.10% DHA (0% to 5.45% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T<sub>2 </sub>seeds produced from event 7362[710]-71005.001-1-35 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0% to 2.84% DHA. In addition, Single T<sub>3 </sub>seeds produced from events 7362[710]-71005.001-1-13, 7362[710]-71005.001-1-18, and 7362[710]-71005.001-1-25 (each event was determined to contain a single, homozygous copy of PAT) contained 0.79% to 4.24% DHA (1.26% to 6.5% total LC-PUFA). Comparatively, the T<sub>2 </sub>seeds produced from events 7362[710]-71005.001-1-13, 7362[710]-71005.001-1-18, and 7362[710]-71005.001-1-25 were assayed via FAMEs analysis and the seeds were determined to contain from 0.79% to 2.84% DHA. The transgenic events were compared to the control plants, the yield per plant (number of seed) and total oil content (%) was found to be similar to the Williams 82 control in similar conditions as the transgenic lines.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0317\" num=\"0303\">For all lines tested, the percentage of DHA and LC-PUFA that was produced and measured in the soybean seed for the T<sub>2 </sub>and T<sub>3 </sub>generations was either consistent or increased in levels from the T<sub>2 </sub>generation to the T<sub>3 </sub>generation. These results indicate that the traits are heritable, and that the transmission of the traits to further generations does not result in reduced DHA production.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0053\">Example 7</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0054\">Western Blot Detection of PUFA Synthase Proteins in Transgenic Soybean Seed</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0318\" num=\"0304\">PUFA synthase OrfA (encoded by SzPUFA OrfA v3 gene), PUFA synthase OrfB (encoded by SzPUFA OrfB v3 gene) PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC (encoded by hThSzPUFA OrfC v3 gene) and HetI (from <i>Nostoc </i>sp. PCC 7120, GenBank ID: P37695, GL20141367) were detected in mature transgenic seed samples by Western blot analysis. Residual soybean T<sub>2 </sub>seed cake samples were retained after the hexane extraction for FAME analysis. The powdered seed cake was placed in a tube with a single 4.5 mm stainless steel ball and extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 2% SDS) was added. The sample tubes were rocked gently for 30 minutes, centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3,000 rcf and the supernatant was used for analysis. The amount of total soluble protein in the seed extract was determined by 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, Ill.). Samples were normalized to 1.25 mg/ml total soluble protein and prepared in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) with 50 mM DTT for a normalized load of 16.25 \u03bcg total soluble protein per lane. Samples were electrophoresed in 3%-8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for detection of PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC.

Region B3 includes the Enoyl Reductase (ER) domain of OrfB. As there is also a homologous ER domain in PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, this antiserum recognizes both PUFA synthase OrfB and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC on a western blot. An anti-rabbit fluorescent labeled secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit AF 633 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.)) was used for detection.

The bands for PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, and PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC could also be seen by direct staining with Coomassie Blue.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0055\">Example 8</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0056\">Expression of the Algal PUFA Synthase Gene Suite Using Alternative Promoters</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0321\" num=\"0307\">The use of additional transcriptional regulatory elements to express the gene(s) encoding PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI proteins can further increase LC-PUFA and DHA content within soybean seeds. Identification and use of transcriptional regulatory elements that express earlier in development during triacylglycerol biosynthesis and deposition, and for extended periods of time can increase the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed by promoting transcription of a LC-PUFA and DHA biosynthetic genes at earlier stages of seed development (e.g., at 15 to 25 DAP) and therefore extend the time of LC-PUFA and DHA production. Examples of such transcriptional regulatory regions include, but are not limited to, the <i>Lesquerella fendleri </i>KCS (LfKCS3) promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 7,253,337) and the FAE 1 promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 6,784,342) and the <i>Brassica oleracea </i>Acyl Carrier Protein (BoACP) promoter (International Publ. No. WO 1992/18634). In addition, other seed specific promoters such as the phaseolin promoter from <i>Phaseolus vulgaris </i>(U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,200) can be used to robustly drive expression of heterologous genes for extended periods of time during seed development to increase the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed. Finally, strong constitutive promoters such as the Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus promoter (CsVMV promoter v2) can be used to drive expression of the heterologous genes throughout all stages of development, thereby increasing the levels of LC-PUFA and DHA within soybean seed and other plant tissues.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0322\" num=\"0308\">These promoters are used singularly or in combination to drive the expression of the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase chimeric OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes, which were previously described in plasmid, pDAB7362. Methods to replace transcriptional regulatory regions within a plasmid are well known within the art. As such, a polynucleotide fragment comprising the PvDlec2 promoter v2 is removed from pDAB7362 (or the preceding plasmids used to build pDAB7362) and replaced with new promoter regions. The newly constructed plasmids are used to stably transform soybean plants. Transgenic soybean plants are isolated and molecularly characterized. The resulting LC-PUFA accumulation is determined by analyzing the lipid profiles (FAMEs) using methods described herein, and soybean plants that produce 0.01% to 15% DHA by weight of total fatty acids, 0.01% to 10% DPA(n-6) by weight of total fatty acids, or 0.01% to 10% EPA by weight of total fatty acids are identified.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0057\">Use of Promoters that Express Early in Seed Development</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0058\">Example 8.1</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0059\">Construction of pDAB9166</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0323\" num=\"0309\">The pDAB9166 plasmid (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 14</figref>; SEQ ID NO:40) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB9166 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

Several review articles discuss Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS) and Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS), such as those of Waterhouse I., 2001 (Nature 411:834-842), Vaucheret and Fagard, 2001 (Trends in Genetics 17(1):29-35, and Okamoto and Hirochika, 2001 (Trends in Plant Sci. 6 (11): 527-534). In plants, gene silencing can be triggered by the duplication of transgenic polynucleotide sequences (tandem repeat transgene sequences, inverted repeat transgene sequences, or multiple insertions into the chromosome) or when a sequence homologous to the target gene sequences is carried either by an infecting plant virus or by the T-DNA of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens. </i> </p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0356\" num=\"0341\">In addition, the duplication of transgene polynucleotide sequences can act as triggers for construct instability. Multiple transgene sequences that share high levels of sequence similarity can fold back on one another. Rearrangements can occur via homologous recombination, wherein intervening sequences of DNA are excised. As a result, fragments of DNA that are located between repeated transgene polynucleotide sequences are excised.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0357\" num=\"0342\">One strategy in designing plasmid vectors is to introduce promoter diversity into a construct by incorporating multiple, unique seed specific promoters that maintain high level expression of each transgene. Introducing promoter sequence diversity into the plasmid vectors can reduce gene silencing and improve plasmid stability. Multiple seed specific promoters include PvDlec2, Phaseolin, and Napin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,608,152). These promoters are relatively comparable in promoter activity such as tissue specificity, levels of expression, duration of expression, etc.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0084\">Example 9.1</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0085\">Construction of pDAB7733</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0358\" num=\"0343\">The pDAB7733 binary plasmid (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 25</figref>; SEQ ID NO:51) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB7733 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

In the first series of completed constructs, each gene expression cassette was positioned in the same direction (\u201chead to tail,\u201d wherein the promoter of one gene expression cassette is located adjacent to the 3\u2032 UTR of a second gene expression cassette). The following constructs describe a strategy wherein, gene expression cassettes are positioned in different directions, and utilize alternative promoters. In these examples, the gene expression cassette is located in trans to a second gene expression cassette such that the promoters of both gene expression cassettes are engineered adjacent to one another. This configuration is described as a \u201chead-to-head\u201d configuration. Other configurations are described in the examples, wherein one gene expression cassettes is located in trans to a second gene expression cassette such that the 3\u2032 UTRs of both gene expression cassettes are engineered adjacent to one another. This configuration is described as a \u201ctail-to-tail\u201d configuration. To mitigate potential read-through of such a design, the bidirectional Orf 23/24 terminator has been placed between these two PTUs. These configurations are proposed to increase expression of the transgenes, thereby resulting in higher concentrations and content of LC-PUFA and DHA fatty acid.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0100\">Example 9.8</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0101\">Construction of pDAB108207</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0374\" num=\"0359\">The pDAB108207 plasmid (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 32</figref>; SEQ ID NO:58) was constructed using a multi-site Gateway L-R recombination reaction. pDAB108207 contains three PUFA synthase PTUs, one phosphopantetheinyl transferase PTU and a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase PTU.

These genes are co-expressed with the algal PUFA synthase genes described above, either through breeding soybean plants containing the ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassette with soybean plants containing the PUFA synthase genes; or by transforming soybean plants with a gene stack containing the ACCase or DGAT2 and the PUFA synthase genes. Regulatory elements necessary for expression of an ACCase or DGAT2 coding sequence can include those described above. Additional regulatory elements expression sequences known in the art may also be used. The ACCase and DGAT2 expression cassettes are transformed into soybean using transformation protocols described above. Transformation may occur as molecular stacks of the ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassette combined with the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes; or as independent ACCase or DGAT2 expression cassettes linked to a selectable marker and then subsequently crossed with soybean plants that contain the PUFA synthase OrfA, PUFA synthase OrfB, PUFA synthase OrfC, acyl-CoA synthetase and 4\u2032 phosphopantetheinyl transferase HetI expression cassettes. Positive transformants are isolated and molecularly characterized. Soybean plants are identified that contain increased accumulation of LC-PUFAs in the plant, the seed of the plant, or plant oil concentrations compared to untransformed control soybean plants. Such increases can range from a 1.2 to a 20-fold increase.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0401\" num=\"0385\">The over-expression of ACCase in the cytoplasm may produce higher levels of malonyl-CoA, Soybean plants or seed containing increased levels of cytoplasmic malonyl-CoA may produce subsequently higher levels of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) when the algal PUFA synthase genes are present and expressed. DGAT2 genes that are expressed within soybean plants may be capable of preferentially incorporating significant amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) into triacylglycerol. DGAT2 genes with substrate preference toward LC-PUFAs (see, e.g., PCT International Publication WO 2009/085169 A2) may increase incorporation of these fatty acids into triacylglycerol (TAG). Such DGAT genes are useful for directing the incorporation of LC-PUFA, particularly DHA, into TAG and for increasing the production of TAG in plants and other organisms.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0127\">Example 12</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0128\">Production of DHA in <i>Arabidopsis </i>Seeds Transformed with Alternative Construct Designs for Expression of PUFA Synthase Genes</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0402\" num=\"0386\"> <i>Arabidopsis </i>T<sub>1 </sub>events transformed with <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>harboring plasmids encoding PUFA synthase genes and HetI (and in some cases SzACS-2) under the control of various plant expression elements were generated using the floral dip method essentially as described in Clough and Bent (Plant J., 1998 16(6):735-43).

data show that certain construct configurations and promoter combinations generate a higher proportion of events containing LC-PUFA in the T<sub>2 </sub>seed (77% of all single copy events for pDAB109507 produced DHA, and 86% of all single copy events for pDAB108207 produced DHA). Also certain constructs generate a higher proportion of events producing &gt;1% LC-PUFA content (33% of all single copy events for pDAB109507, and 34% of all single copy events for pDAB108207). The maximum LC-PUFA content of the T<sub>2 </sub>seed from the various events ranged from 0.24%-2.03% for the different constructs. Likewise, certain constructs produce higher levels of omega-3 LC-PUFAs. The maximum DHA content ranged from 0.17%-1.45% and the maximum EPA content ranged from 0%-0.26% across all the constructs and events generated. These data indicate that the alteration of the construct design where promoter configurations were changed resulted in transgenic plants that exhibit increased LC-PUFA, as compared to transgenic plants that were transformed with pDAB7362. As such, these constructs in which the construct design was altered are desirable for crop transformations.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0405\" num=\"0388\">T<sub>2 </sub>seed from high LC-PUFA producing events was planted and the leaf tissue from the growing plants was sampled using quantitative PCR to assay the PAT gene and other transgenes. Plants containing two copies of the transgenes (i.e., homozygotes) were identified and grown to maturity. The resulting T<sub>3 </sub>seed was harvested and analyzed for LC-PUFA content. Some constructs such as pDAB7362 and pDAB109509, which contained repeated promoter/3\u2032 UTR expression elements, showed poor stability of the LC-PUFA trait in the subsequent T<sub>3 </sub>seed generation. However, some events transformed with different construct configurations and/or diversified expression elements (e.g., pDAB108207, 109508 and 7734) produced significantly improved stability of the LC-PUFA trait into the T<sub>3 </sub>seed generation, as shown in Table 13. These data indicate that certain constructs can maintain stability of the DHA trait in subsequent generations and that such constructs are preferred for crop transformations.</p>\\n    <p
