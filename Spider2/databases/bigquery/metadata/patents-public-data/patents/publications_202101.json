            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'FIELD OF INVENTION \\n     The invention relates to combine harvesters and particularly to systems for transferring crop material from threshing and separating apparatus to a grain cleaning unit. More specifically the invention relates to conveyance systems which include grain pans arranged to catch a crop stream, the grain pans being driven in an oscillating manner to convey the crop stream rearwardly to a grain cleaning unit. \\n     BACKGROUND \\n     The process for cleaning grain in combine harvesters has not changed fundamentally for many decades. The cleaning unit, or \u2018shoe\u2019, has directed therethrough a cleaning airstream which is typically generated by a cross-flow or centrifugal fan located in front of the cleaning shoe. As a mix of grain kernels, chaff, tailings and straw is passed over one or more oscillating sieves, the cleaning airstream serves to blow the lighter material in a generally rearward direction over the sieves and out of the rear of the machine. The grain is generally heavier and/or smaller than the material other than grain (MOG) in the mix and passes through the sieves. \\n     The cleaning shoe is most efficient when the grain is caused to settle on the uppermost sieve (hereinafter referred to as the chaffer) as early as possible and the lighter material is kept airborne. If the grain bounces on impact with the chaffer then the risk of the cleaning airstream carrying the grain out of the rear of the shoe increases. The speed of the cleaning airstream is typically selected to strike a balance between grain cleanliness and acceptable loss. Ultimately, this balance creates a limit on the capacity of the cleaning unit. In other words, without an increase in shoe size, any increase in capacity will adversely affect grain cleanliness and/or loss rate. \\n     However, despite these limits, there remains a continuing drive to increase the size and capacity of combine harvesters to meet the needs of modern farmers and to speed up the overall harvesting process. As outlined above, increasing the throughput of the cleaning shoe with known technology requires an increase in the physical size. For example, increasing the width of the cleaning shoe would deliver an increased machine capacity but at the cost of increased machine width. However, maximum machine width is limited by road transport legislation in some countries thus rendering this option unattractive. In a similar vein, increasing the length of the chaffer would require an increase in wheel base and a consequential increase in turn radius which is undesirable to farmers. \\n     Efforts to increase the capacity of the cleaning shoe based on pre-stratification of the crop stream have been made. For example, WO-2012/095239 discloses a combine harvester having an extended return pan which catches separated crop material from overhead threshing and separating apparatus and conveys such to a front edge from where it drops on to a grain pan, the grain pan conveying the crop mix rearwardly to a rear edge from where it falls into the cleaning shoe. In this disclosure, the return pan is of an extended construction to deliver the majority of the separated material to the front of the grain pan to facilitate enhanced stratification of the material before delivery to the cleaning shoe. As disclosed therein, the recognised advantage that the grain rich bottom layer falls directly onto the chaffer whereas the upper MOG-rich layer is rendered airborne by the cleaning airstream. \\n     The process of stratification has been found to be very sensitive to working on side-hills. It is known to provide structure on the grain pan in the form of longitudinal fins which prevent the crop material from piling up on one side of the grain pan when operating on a side-hill. However, even the provision of such fins does not aid stratification of the grain and MOG. \\n     SUMMARY OF INVENTION \\n     It is therefore an object of the invention to compensate for the effects of side-hill conditions upon the stratification of crop material on a grain pan upstream of the cleaning shoe. \\n     In accordance with the invention there is provided a combine harvester comprising:\\n         a grain pan arranged to catch a crop stream, the grain pan being driven in an oscillating manner to convey the crop stream rearwardly to a rear edge;   a cleaning unit comprising a fan for generating a cleaning airstream which is directed under the rear edge;   the grain pan comprising a transversely corrugated surface and a plurality of longitudinal gullies having a curved profile.       \\n\\n     The invention involves the recognition that, in side-hill conditions for a conventional machine, the crop material piles up on the divider fins which are devoid of ripples or corrugated surface. The material therefore experiences a reduction in contact with the rippled pan floor. Moreover, the surface of the accumulated material is typically below horizontal due to the motion of the pan combined with the reduction in contact with the rippled floor. Both of these adversely affects the stratification of the crop material mix. \\n     By provided corrugated gullies with a curved profile in accordance with the invention the crop material on the grain pan \u2018experiences\u2019 no difference when operating in side-hill conditions. Despite the side-hill the crop material remains in contact with a corrugated surface and, as a result, remains horizontal with respect to gravity. \\n     The gullies may extend to the rear edge of the grain pan. In this case the gullies serve to funnel or focus the heavier grain-rich crop material into a plurality of discrete streams which fall over the rear edge of the grain pan. In this regard, the invention also involves the recognition that an evenly spread, albeit stratified, layer of crop material falling over the rear edge of the grain pan suffers in that the cleaning airstream passing under the edge thereof must pass through the relatively dense grain-rich layer to engage and lift the lighter MOG. By channelling the grain-rich bottom layer into a number of spaced discrete streams, gaps between the streams permit unobstructed passages (or vents) for the cleaning airstream to impact the lighter MOG-rich material. \\n     The profile of the pan floor is preferably mimicked on the underside of the pan so as to influence the air profile. In other words, the profile of the pan floor is evident from the underside also. The profile of the pan minimizes or eliminates the airflow below the gullies while increasing the height and thereby air flow below the ridges in between. Increasing the total air flow (typically but not exclusive by increasing the rotation speed of the fan) will primarily increase the air flow below the ridges and only to a lower extent below the gullies or troughs. Differentiating the grain, MOG and air distribution across the width of the cleaning system in this manner allows for a higher total air flow to be employed without increasing the losses. In turn, this allows for an increase in the capacity of the cleaning system without increasing the spatial envelope required. \\n     The curved profile is preferably circular. \\n     The curved profile may include inwardly inclined sidewalls which has been found to enhance stratification of the crop material. \\n     The invention lends itself to a combine harvester employing virtually any known type of threshing and separating apparatus. For example, the threshing and separating apparatus may be of the conventional type, a single or twin-axial type, or a hybrid system. A return pan is preferably located under the threshing and separating apparatus so as to catch crop material falling therefrom and convey such forwardly to a front edge wherein the front edge is positioned above the grain pan. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS \\n       Further advantages of the invention will become apparent from reading the following description of specific embodiments with reference to the appended drawings in which: \\n         FIG. 1  is a schematic left side elevation view of a combine harvester having a crop material conveyance system suitable for embodying the invention; \\n         FIG. 2  is a top left rear perspective view of a grain pan in accordance with an embodiment of the invention; \\n         FIG. 3  is a highly schematic vertical section through a grain pan in accordance with an embodiment of the invention illustrating the crop material and shown operating on a side-hill. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS \\n     The invention will be described in connection with various preferred embodiments. Relative terms such as front, rear, forward, rearward, left, right, longitudinal and transverse will be made with reference to the longitudinal vehicle axis of a combine harvester travelling in the normal direction of travel. The terms \u201cdirection of conveyance\u201d, \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d are made with reference to the general flow of crop material through the combine harvester. \\n     With reference to  FIG. 1  a combine harvester  10  includes a frame  12 , front wheels  14  and rear steerable wheels  16 , the wheels engaging with the ground  101 . A cutting header  17  is detachably supported on the front of a feederhouse  18  which is pivotable about a transverse axis \u2018X\u2019 to lift and lower the header  17  in a conventional manner. \\n     The combine  10  is driven in a forward direction (arrow F) across a field of standing crop  102  in a known manner. The header  17  serves to cut and gather the crop material before conveying such in to feederhouse  18  and the elevator  19  housed therein. \\n     At this stage the crop stream is unprocessed. It should be understood that combine harvesters are employed to harvest a host of different crops including cereal, rice, corn and grass seed. The following description will make reference to various parts of a cereal crop stream but it should be understood that this is by way of example only and does not by any means limit the applicability of the invention to harvesting other harvested crops. \\n     The cut crop stream is conveyed rearwardly from the feederhouse  18  to a processor designated generally at  20 . The processor  20  of the illustrated combine includes an axial flow threshing and separating rotor which is fed at its front end by a feed beater  21 . Axial flow rotor  20  serves to thresh the crop stream in a front region, separate the grain therefrom in a rear region, and eject the straw residue through the rear of the machine either directly onto the ground in windrow or via a straw chopper (not shown). A concaved grate  22  in the underside of the threshing and separating rotor  20  allows the separated material to fall by gravity onto a return pan  23  located below. \\n     Although described in relation to an axial flow processor it should be understood that alternative processors known in the art may be employed instead. For example, a conventional, tangential flow, threshing cylinder with downstream straw walkers may replace the processor shown. In yet another alternatives, hybrid or transverse threshing technology may be employed. \\n     Return pan  23  comprises a tray-like structure and serves to convey the collected grain forwardly (in the direction F) to a respective front edge thereof in a known manner. It should be understood that the term \u201cpan\u201d will be used for grain conveyance components which serve to convey grain in a given direction. This is in contrast to \u201csieves\u201d which include a perforated structure to separate material and will be described in more detail below. \\n     The single return pan  23  may be replaced by a dual return pan arrangement such as that described in WO-2015/062965 for example. Alternatively, a continuously driven belt may be employed. \\n     At this stage in the process a mix of grain, kernels, chaff, un-threshed tailings and shorter straw have been separated from the majority of the straw residue, the separated mix having fallen through the concave or grate of processor  20  onto the return pan  23 . The remaining straw residue  103  continues in a spiral path around the axial rotor  20  to the rear from where it is discharged onto the ground in a windrow  104 . \\n     The separated crop mix will hereinafter be referred to as a grain-MOG mix wherein MOG refers to Material Other than Grain and includes the tailings, straw and chaff. \\n     The grain-MOG mix falls onto a grain pan  26  which will hereinafter be referred to as \u201cstratification pan\u201d  26  for reasons to become apparent below. \\n     The stratification pan  26  is driven in a similar oscillating manner to the return pan, that is in a fore-and-aft oscillating motion which may be linear or partly circular. The stratification pan floor is transversely corrugated, or rippled, with a saw-toothed profile. The combination of the saw-toothed profile with the oscillating motion conveys the grain-MOG mix in a generally rearward direction towards a rear edge  27  from where the mix falls onto the front of a top sieve or chaffer  30 . \\n     As the grain-MOG mix falls from the stratification pan rear edge it is subjected to a cleaning airstream generated by fan unit  32  which includes a cross-flow fan in a fan housing. Ducting  34  directs the pressurised air under the rear edge  27 , the airstream serving to blow the MOG upwardly and rearwardly towards the rear of the machine. This process will be described in more detail later on. \\n     Chaffer  30  comprises adjustable louvres supported on a chaffer frame which is driven in fore-and-aft oscillating manner. The material which settles on the chaffer  30  is conveyed in a generally rearward direction and the heavier smaller grain-rich material passes between the louvres onto an underlying lower sieve  38 , whereas the lighter larger material passes to the end of the chaffer and out of the rear of the machine at  40 . A rear section of chaffer  30 a may be independently adjustable and is configured to allow un-threshed tailings to pass therethrough into a re-threshing region  42  from where the tailings are conveyed to a re-threshing auger  44 . \\n     Lower sieve  38  is also driven in an oscillating manner to convey the collected grain-MOG mix rearwardly wherein the material falling therethrough is collected in a clean grain trough  46  for conveyance by an elevator (not shown) to a grain tank  48 . Material which does not pass through lower sieve  38  and is instead conveyed off the rear edge thereof falls into re-threshing region  42  for subsequent re-threshing in accordance with known principles. \\n     The airstream generated by fan unit  32  is also conveyed by ducting up through lower sieve  38  and chaffer  30  to encourage lifting of the MOG from the chaffer surface. For ease of reference hereinafter the chaffer  30 , lower sieve  38 , fan unit  32  will be collectively referred to as \u201cthe cleaning shoe  50 \u201d. Moreover, the return pan  23  and stratification pan  26  will be referred to as \u201cthe crop material transfer system\u201d which serves the purpose of transferring the material separated by the processor  20  to the cleaning shoe  50 . \\n     For completeness the combine  10  includes an unloading system which includes an unloading auger  54  shown in part in  FIG. 1 . \\n     The above described operating principle of a combine harvester, and in particular the flow of crop material therethrough, is known in the art. The various inventive aspects relate to the crop material transfer system and especially to the construction and operation of stratification pan  26 , these inventive aspects to be described below. \\n     Stratification pan  26  serves to convey the collected grain-MOG mix in a rearward direction. During this conveyance it has been found advantageous to actively facilitate stratification of the different material types before reaching the rear edge  27  for presentation to the cleaning shoe  50 . WO-2012/095239 discloses recognition of the advantages from enhanced stratification by depositing the material towards the front end of the pan  26 . The action of conveyance itself serves to stratify the grain-MOG mix, wherein the heavier grain kernels work down to the bottom layer and the lighter MOG rises to the top layer. As the stratified material falls from the rear edge  27  the MOG already present on the top becomes airborne more easily without hindrance from the heavier grain, whereas the latter falls directly onto the chaffer  30  (optionally via a cascade pan) thus settling more efficiently with reduced grain bounce. \\n     The inventive aspects follow on from this recognition and serve to encourage and facilitate stratification of the grain and MOG upstream of the cleaning shoe. \\n     It is known to provide longitudinally aligned baffles or fins on the stratification pan  26  in a spaced manner to prevent the crop material moving to one side of the pan when working on hillsides and to maintain a substantially uniform loading across the width of the pan  26 . However, resulting from efforts to enhance the aforementioned stratification process, it has been found that such fins so not assist with stratification and potentially even inhibit such. \\n       FIG. 2  shows part of a grain, or \u201cstratification\u201d, pan  26  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the pan  26  comprising a series of gullies  91  (alternatively termed troughs, channels or valleys) aligned in a longitudinal direction. Looking at a transverse section (as shown in  FIG. 3 ) the gullies have a part-circular profile extending to the rear edge  27 . \\n     The gullies  91  have a transversely corrugated or rippled surface which serves to assist in the rearward conveyance of the crop material disposed thereon. \\n     The curved profile of the gullies  91  ensures that the crop material mix does not experience any difference in the contact surface when operating in side-hill conditions. As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , the grain-rich lower layer G and the MOG-rich upper layer M both remain in contact with the corrugated surface and, as such, remain substantially level with the gravitational horizontal H. \\n     It can be seen from  FIGS. 2 and 3  that the side-by-side gullies  91  define a transverse floor profile of alternating ridges and troughs, the profile being more pronounced toward the rear edge  27 . The profile encourages the formation of discrete streams of crop material which fall from the rear edge  27 . Moreover, the profile is mimicked in the underside of the pan and, as such, affects the profile of the cleaning airstream passing under the rear edge  27 . The profile of the pan minimizes or eliminates the airflow below the gullies while increasing the height and thereby air flow below the ridges. Increasing the total air flow (typically but not exclusive by increasing the rotation speed of the fan) will primarily increase the airflow below the ridges and only to a lower extent below the troughs. Differentiating the grain, MOG and air distribution across the width of the cleaning system in this manner allows for a higher total air flow to be employed without increasing the losses. In turn, this allows for an increase in the capacity of the cleaning system without increasing the spatial envelope required. \\n     Although shown as extending from the front edge to the rear edge  27  of the stratification pan  26 , it is envisaged that the gullies may extend along only a part of the length of the pan without departing from the scope of the invention. \\n     The embodiment described herein above may additionally comprise a cascade pan disposed between the stratification pan and the chaffer, wherein the cascade pan is driven to oscillate and convey crop material falling from the rear edge of the stratification pan to the chaffer. \\n     In summary there is provided a combine harvester comprising a grain pan arranged to catch a crop stream from threshing or separating apparatus. The grain pan is driven in an oscillating manner to convey the crop stream rearwardly to a rear edge. A cleaning unit comprises a fan for generating a cleaning airstream) which is directed under the rear edge of the grain pan. The grain pan comprises a transversely corrugated surface and a plurality of longitudinal gullies having a curved profile for compensating for side-hill operation. \\n     It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the disclosure. Many variations and modifications may be made to the above-described embodiment(s) of the disclosure without departing substantially from the spirit and principles of the disclosure.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The terms \u201cdirection of conveyance\u201d, \u201cupstream\u201d and \u201cdownstream\u201d are made with reference to the general flow of crop material through the combine harvester.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0024\">With reference to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> a combine harvester <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>12</b>, front wheels <b>14</b> and rear steerable wheels <b>16</b>, the wheels engaging with the ground <b>101</b>. A cutting header <b>17</b> is detachably supported on the front of a feederhouse <b>18</b> which is pivotable about a transverse axis \u2018X\u2019 to lift and lower the header <b>17</b> in a conventional manner.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0025\">The combine <b>10</b> is driven in a forward direction (arrow F) across a field of standing crop <b>102</b> in a known manner. The header <b>17</b> serves to cut and gather the crop material before conveying such in to feederhouse <b>18</b> and the elevator <b>19</b> housed therein.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0026\">At this stage the crop stream is unprocessed. It should be understood that combine harvesters are employed to harvest a host of different crops including cereal, rice, corn and grass seed. The following description will make reference to various parts of a cereal crop stream but it should be understood that this is by way of example only and does not by any means limit the applicability of the invention to harvesting other harvested crops.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0027\">The cut crop stream is conveyed rearwardly from the feederhouse <b>18</b> to a processor designated generally at <b>20</b>. The processor <b>20</b> of the illustrated combine includes an axial flow threshing and separating rotor which is fed at its front end by a feed beater <b>21</b>. Axial flow rotor <b>20</b> serves to thresh the crop stream in a front region, separate the grain therefrom in a rear region, and eject the straw residue through the rear of the machine either directly onto the ground in windrow or via a straw chopper (not shown). A concaved grate <b>22</b> in the underside of the threshing and separating rotor <b>20</b> allows the separated material to fall by gravity onto a return pan <b>23</b> located below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0028\">Although described in relation to an axial flow processor it should be understood that alternative processors known in the art may be employed instead. For example, a conventional, tangential flow, threshing cylinder with downstream straw walkers may replace the processor shown. In yet another alternatives, hybrid or transverse threshing technology may be employed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0029\">Return pan <b>23</b> comprises a tray-like structure and serves to convey the collected grain forwardly (in the direction F) to a respective front edge thereof in a known manner. It should be understood that the term \u201cpan\u201d will be used for grain conveyance components which serve to convey grain in a given direction. This is in contrast to \u201csieves\u201d which include a perforated structure to separate material and will be described in more detail below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0030\">The single return pan <b>23</b> may be replaced by a dual return pan arrangement such as that described in WO-2015/062965 for example. Alternatively, a continuously driven belt may be employed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0031\">At this stage in the process a mix of grain, kernels, chaff, un-threshed tailings and shorter straw have been separated from the majority of the straw residue, the separated mix having fallen through the concave or grate of processor <b>20</b> onto the return pan <b>23</b>. The remaining straw residue <b>103</b> continues in a spiral path around the axial rotor <b>20</b> to the rear from where it is discharged onto the ground in a windrow <b>104</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0032\">The separated crop mix will hereinafter be referred to as a grain-MOG mix wherein MOG refers to Material Other than Grain and includes the tailings, straw and chaff.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0033\">The grain-MOG mix falls onto a grain pan <b>26</b> which will hereinafter be referred to as \u201cstratification pan\u201d <b>26</b> for reasons to become apparent below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0034\">The stratification pan <b>26</b> is driven in a similar oscillating manner to the return pan, that is in a fore-and-aft oscillating motion which may be linear or partly circular. The stratification pan floor is transversely corrugated, or rippled, with a saw-toothed profile. The combination of the saw-toothed profile with the oscillating motion conveys the grain-MOG mix in a generally rearward direction towards a rear edge <b>27</b> from where the mix falls onto the front of a top sieve or chaffer <b>30</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0035\">As the grain-MOG mix falls from the stratification pan rear edge it is subjected to a cleaning airstream generated by fan unit <b>32</b> which includes a cross-flow fan in a fan housing. Ducting <b>34</b> directs the pressurised air under the rear edge <b>27</b>, the airstream serving to blow the MOG upwardly and rearwardly towards the rear of the machine. This process will be described in more detail later on.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0036\">Chaffer <b>30</b> comprises adjustable louvres supported on a chaffer frame which is driven in fore-and-aft oscillating manner. The material which settles on the chaffer <b>30</b> is conveyed in a generally rearward direction and the heavier smaller grain-rich material passes between the louvres onto an underlying lower sieve <b>38</b>, whereas the lighter larger material passes to the end of the chaffer and out of the rear of the machine at <b>40</b>. A rear section of chaffer <b>30</b>a may be independently adjustable and is configured to allow un-threshed tailings to pass therethrough into a re-threshing region <b>42</b> from where the tailings are conveyed to a re-threshing auger <b>44</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0037\">Lower sieve <b>38</b> is also driven in an oscillating manner to convey the collected grain-MOG mix rearwardly wherein the material falling therethrough is collected in a clean grain trough <b>46</b> for conveyance by an elevator (not shown) to a grain tank <b>48</b>. Material which does not pass through lower sieve <b>38</b> and is instead conveyed off the rear edge thereof falls into re-threshing region <b>42</b> for subsequent re-threshing in accordance with known principles.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0036\" num=\"0038\">The airstream generated by fan unit <b>32</b> is also conveyed by ducting up through lower sieve <b>38</b> and chaffer <b>30</b> to encourage lifting of the MOG from the chaffer surface. For ease of reference hereinafter the chaffer <b>30</b>, lower sieve <b>38</b>, fan unit <b>32</b> will be collectively referred to as \u201cthe cleaning shoe <b>50</b>\u201d. Moreover, the return pan <b>23</b> and stratification pan <b>26</b> will be referred to as \u201cthe crop material transfer system\u201d which serves the purpose of transferring the material separated by the processor <b>20</b> to the cleaning shoe <b>50</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0039\">For completeness the combine <b>10</b> includes an unloading system which includes an unloading auger <b>54</b> shown in part in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0040\">The above described operating principle of a combine harvester, and in particular the flow of crop material therethrough, is known in the art. The various inventive aspects relate to the crop material transfer system and especially to the construction and operation of stratification pan <b>26</b>, these inventive aspects to be described below.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0041\">Stratification pan <b>26</b> serves to convey the collected grain-MOG mix in a rearward direction. During this conveyance it has been found advantageous to actively facilitate stratification of the different material types before reaching the rear edge <b>27</b> for presentation to the cleaning shoe <b>50</b>. WO-2012/095239 discloses recognition of the advantages from enhanced stratification by depositing the material towards the front end of the pan <b>26</b>. The action of conveyance itself serves to stratify the grain-MOG mix, wherein the heavier grain kernels work down to the bottom layer and the lighter MOG rises to the top layer. As the stratified material falls from the rear edge <b>27</b> the MOG already present on the top becomes airborne more easily without hindrance from the heavier grain, whereas the latter falls directly onto the chaffer <b>30</b> (optionally via a cascade pan) thus settling more efficiently with reduced grain bounce.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0042\">The inventive aspects follow on from this recognition and serve to encourage and facilitate stratification of the grain and MOG upstream of the cleaning shoe.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0043\">It is known to provide longitudinally aligned baffles or fins on the stratification pan <b>26</b> in a spaced manner to prevent the crop material moving to one side of the pan when working on hillsides and to maintain a substantially uniform loading across the width of the pan <b>26</b>. However, resulting from efforts to enhance the aforementioned stratification process, it has been found that such fins so not assist with stratification and potentially even inhibit such.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0044\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> shows part of a grain, or \u201cstratification\u201d, pan <b>26</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the pan <b>26</b> comprising a series of gullies <b>91</b> (alternatively termed troughs, channels or valleys) aligned in a longitudinal direction. Looking at a transverse section (as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>) the gullies have a part-circular profile extending to the rear edge <b>27</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0045\">The gullies <b>91</b> have a transversely corrugated or rippled surface which serves to assist in the rearward conveyance of the crop material disposed thereon.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0046\">The curved profile of the gullies <b>91</b> ensures that the crop material mix does not experience any difference in the contact surface when operating in side-hill conditions. As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the grain-rich lower layer G and the MOG-rich upper layer M both remain in contact with the corrugated surface and, as such, remain substantially level with the gravitational horizontal H.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0047\">It can be seen from <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> that the side-by-side gullies <b>91</b> define a transverse floor profile of alternating ridges and troughs, the profile being more pronounced toward the rear edge <b>27</b>. The profile encourages the formation of discrete streams of crop material which fall from the rear edge <b>27</b>. Moreover, the profile is mimicked in the underside of the pan and, as such, affects the profile of the cleaning airstream passing under the rear edge <b>27</b>. The profile of the pan minimizes or eliminates the airflow below the gullies while increasing the height and thereby air flow below the ridges. Increasing the total air flow (typically but not exclusive by increasing the rotation speed of the fan) will primarily increase the airflow below the ridges and only to a lower extent below the troughs. Differentiating the grain, MOG and air distribution across the width of the cleaning system in this manner allows for a higher total air flow to be employed without increasing the losses. In turn, this allows for an increase in the capacity of the cleaning system without increasing the spatial envelope required.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0048\">Although shown as extending from the front edge to the rear edge <b>27</b> of the stratification pan <b>26</b>, it is envisaged that the gullies may extend along only a part of the length of the pan without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0049\">The embodiment described herein above may additionally comprise a cascade pan disposed between the stratification pan and the chaffer, wherein the cascade pan is driven to oscillate and convey crop material falling from the rear edge of the stratification pan to the chaffer.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0050\">In summary there is provided a combine harvester comprising a grain pan arranged to catch a crop stream from threshing or separating apparatus. The grain pan is driven in an oscillating manner to convey the crop stream rearwardly to a rear edge. A cleaning unit comprises a fan for generating a cleaning airstream) which is directed under the rear edge of the grain pan. The grain pan comprises a transversely corrugated surface and a plurality of longitudinal gullies having a curved profile for compensating for side-hill operation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0051\">It should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure are merely possible examples of implementations, merely set forth for a clear understanding of the principles of the disclosure.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'PRIORITY CLAIM \\n     The present invention was first filed on Jul. 28, 2011 as U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/574,163. The legal priority and benefits of this first filing are expressly claimed herein. \\n    \\n    \\n     FIELD OF THE INVENTION \\n     The present invention relates generally to a shock absorber, damping, and rebounding apparatus for managing contact impact forces as well as the transfer, thermal conversion, and dissipation of kinetic energy between interacting systems, such as the sprung weight or position of a vehicle and the unsprung weight or posture of a vehicle. Particularly, the present invention relates to and is directed toward marked improvements of the management of that kinetic energy using a hydraulic shock absorber apparatus of the type employing a fluid filled rigid or flexible cylinder and means for forcing the fluid reciprocally through a valving system with a piston arrangement. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     Hydraulic Shock Absorbers \\n     Conventional piston-type hydraulic shock absorbers typically comprise a fluid-filled cylinder and piston arrangement; and include a piston head attached to an input shaft, whereby the input forces are axially applied to the shaft and initiate reciprocal movement of the piston head within the internal bore volume of the cylinder. In action, reciprocation of the piston head displaces a quantity of hydraulic fluid (typically a petroleum based oil) through an orifice, a controlling port, or a metering valve\u2014whereby the input kinetic energy is dissipated by displacement of the hydraulic fluid through the orifice, port or valve. The travel velocity of the reciprocating piston head, and thus the quantity of kinetic energy dissipated, is controlled by carefully metering the flow speed of the displaced hydraulic fluid to proceed at a prechosen rate. \\n     Many arrangements for achieving an orifice variable with piston head position have been developed; and it is frequently desirable to provide some means of for varying the orifice restriction with the position of the piston head along its stroke. By use of such means, the resistance to hydraulic fluid motion can be made dependent upon and become tailored functions of specified parameter values such as rates of fluid velocity and the position of the piston head within the cylinder bore volume. \\n     A variety of hydraulic fluid flow arrangements which vary with piston position have been developed; and among these, many of the conventionally known hydraulic shock absorbers employ piston arrangements which force a low viscosity, petroleum-based oil or similar liquid through small openings or valves under very high pressure. Such devices may include a circular orifice in the piston through which passes a tapered rod attached to the cylinder wall; these often have varied depth grooves in the side wall of the cylinder and use tapered cylinders in which a fixed diameter piston and spring-loaded valves operate. \\n     A common problem in these conventionally known mechanisms is the inability to arrest or resist rectilinear motion of mechanical parts; and a typical solution has been to employ a piston-cylinder assembly having a restricted passage for hydraulic fluid lowing from one side of the piston head to the other. Other shock absorbing assemblies incorporate grooves or furrows of varying depth into the material substance of the cylinder walls (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 695,775); or use tapered cylinders in which a fixed diameter piston operates (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,062,331); or dispose one or more complex valves into the passageway (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,113,072). \\n     Also, as merely one vivid additional example of such a solution arrangement, U.S. Pat. No. 4,048,905 discloses a piston cylinder hydraulic snubbing device which employs the gap between ends of a piston ring as a valve orifice. This valve orifice, or piston ring gap, is varied by engagement of the ring with a tapered bore in the cylinder. Thus, on a jounce stroke, the piston ring is compressed against the tapered sidewall of the cylinder and closes the ring gap, thereby increasing piston stroke resistance. On the rebound stroke, the piston ring expands against the tapered sidewall of the cylinder, thereby opening the ring gap and reducing hydraulic resistance to the rebound stroke. \\n     Another routine and commonplace problem encountered by conventional hydraulic shock absorbers involves the over-heating, foaming, and cavitation of the petroleum oil (or other liquid) used as hydraulic fluid. It has long been recognized that the heat created by conventional shock absorbers is largely generated either at the orifice, port or valve adjacent the piston or at one end of the cylinder; and such heat accumulates and becomes centered in the hydraulic fluid. In operative terms, this means that the quantitative bulk of the hydraulic fluid must initially absorb the heat energy and itself consequently rise in temperature before the flowing fluid can carry the heat energy to the cylinder walls for subsequent transfer and dissipation. Thus, over time and expected duration of use, the hydraulic fluid continuously suffers from repetitious heating effects and frequently severely degrades over time from over-heating, foaming, and cavitation in-situ. \\n     A commonly employed solution for this heat problem is to pressurize the hydraulic fluid chamber with a coolant such as gaseous nitrogen in order to control internal vapor pressures, reduce hydraulic fluid foaming and fade, and thereby Improve performance. More recent attempts to improve shock absorber performance have also led to the use of electronic or computer controlled valving in order to provide an acceptable level of performance over a wider range of operational conditions. However, by employing such extrinsic active valve controls, the time-lag occurring between the heat sensing event and the act of actual damping prevents real time synchronicity. As a result, both the reliability and the manufacturing cost of the typical shock absorber apparatus have now become very significant factors in the design of an adequate damper and/or suspension system for a vehicle. \\n     Dampers and Damping Systems \\n     Dampers are specific devices and constructions which act and are characterized by their ability to convert kinetic energy to heat energy. Such devices are typically used in wheeled vehicles and with different kinds of aircraft to absorb kinetic energy resulting from contact impact shocks and terrain caused vibrations. Merely exemplifying and representing the range and variety of conventionally known damper devices and damping systems are those disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,743,362; 5,347,771; 5,076,403; and 5,036,633 respectively. \\n     In one exemplary type of damper, the kinetic energy causes a piston to move through a cylinder containing viscous fluid. An orifice is provided such that the hydraulic fluid can flow around the moving piston to absorb the kinetic energy and then to convert the kinetic energy resulting from contact impact shocks and terrain caused vibrations into heat energy. However, it has been long recognized that changes in operating temperature can greatly alter the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid such that, at ever-higher operating temperatures, the fluid becomes ever-less viscous, and the energy converted by the damper markedly decreases. Consequently, the long recognized variations in damper performance owing to large changes in operating temperature makes the use of such conventional damping devices and systems unreliable, and often unacceptable, in many instances and desired applications. \\n     Accordingly, a substantial and long recognized need remains today for an improved shock absorber and damper apparatus which will function reliably over a wide range of operating temperatures; and also avoid, or markedly reduce, or meaningfully eliminate the many defects now routinely present in conventionally available shock absorbing and damping systems. In particular, a substantial need still exists for a shock absorber apparatus which lacks the propensity to foaming of its fluid and other thermally-related degradations of performance, as well as having close time-wise synchronicity between sensing the kinetic event to be damped and applying appropriate damping. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     In its most general structural form, the present invention is an inertial terrain transit event manager apparatus comprising: \\n     an elongated hollow cylinder having an end wall with a pre-sized opening, a closed end wall, at least two discrete solid sidewalls, and an extended internal bore volume;

The apparatus employs an elevated viscosity non-petroleum fluid as a damping medium; and presents a unique structural construction that utilizes peripheral valving to shunt a high viscosity hydraulic fluid between the peripheral edge of the piston head and the cylinder wall. \\n     In particular, the invention is an Inertial Terrain Transit Event Manager (or \u201cITTEM\u201d)\u2014an apparatus suitable for absorbing, attenuating, adapting, preventing, and diffusing deflections and other kinetic energy events; and in which the wheels or treads, suspension system, or supporting undercarriage of a vehicle or aircraft transfer Impact shock tortes and oscillation energy to the body of the vehicle or aircraft then engaged in the process of contacting a solid surface or crossing terrain. As such, the ITTEM is a shock absorber and damper apparatus of the general type having a hydraulic cylinder and reciprocating piston; is an apparatus suitable for managing initial impact shocks as well as controlling rebound effects; and can effectively control ride-height when combined with an incorporated or associated spring capability (metal springs and/or compressed gas), as well as manage ride-height (either passively with spring capability or actively with ride-height control decoupled from that spring capability). \\n     As is described in greater detail hereinafter, the cylinder of the ITTEM apparatus contains a reciprocating piston mechanism and a discrete compartment whose volume is desirably filled with a silicone-based hydraulic fluid of elevated viscosity, this viscous hydraulic fluid having only slight compressibility under pressure and preferably exhibiting a pseudo-plastic flow when pressurized. As a result, with the occurrence of impact shock forces and oscillation energy, a displacement and upward-stroke movement of a piston head is initiated within the internal bore volume of the cylinder; which in turn creates an intense compression force and hydraulic pressure upon the viscous hydraulic fluid contained therein; and also generates an increasing kinetic energy in and fluid flow for the viscous hydraulic fluid, which takes the form of fluidic bow-waves and/or ultrasonic shock waves. \\n     Thus, when moving through the internal bore volume of the cylinder, these flowing fluid waves will first encounter a deformable flow baffle or other structural form of intrinsic damping-force control means; and then are directed in flow direction to enter an open channel pathway of an thermally expandable annular gap, which is located adjacently between the piston head and the sidewalls of the cylinder. This thermally expandable annular gap not only controls and directs the wave flow path of the viscous hydraulic fluid, but also serves as a temperature expanding peripheral valve. \\n     Ire function and overall effect therefore, the open channel of the thermally expandable annular gap acts as a peripheral control gateway and release portal of temperature variable size for the ingress and egress of moving viscous fluid waves generated by fluid resistance to piston head displacement within the bore volume of the cylinder; and in combination with the deformable flow baffle or other chosen structural format (passive, or active, or both of these), will provide greatly enhanced shock absorbing capabilities and effective damping for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     In this manner, the organization of the ITTEM apparatus utilizes peripheral valving to shunt hydraulic fluid between the peripheral edge of the piston head and each of the cylinder sidewalls (or in the alternative, the periphery of a nested piston and the flow-channel adjacently located by it); and manages and directs that flowing fluid into an open channel pathway lying between the piston periphery and the cylinder\u2014all without the use of any additional components. \\n     Notably also, the ITTEM apparatus performs the function of damping control via different modes of damping, which include: velocity-gradient-based damping, laminar-flow-damping, turbulent-flow-damping, damping in subsonic-through-Machian flow regimes; as well as the multiple transitional-flow instances occurring between these via unique hydrodynamic configuration. \\n     Major Advantages and Notable Benefits of the ITTEM Apparatus \\n     Among the marked advantages and many desirable benefits of the ITTEM apparatus are the following: \\n     1. The ITTEM apparatus uses and takes advantage of currently available real-time electronic control systems; and has the capability to control non-linear aspects of transient fluid flow dynamics; and provides the ability to reduce the time-lag between the sensing of an impact force and effective damping action. These multiple capabilities represent clear differences and major distinctions over conventional hydraulic shock absorber systems. \\n     2. Via the use of thermal expansion means to manage changes in hydraulic fluid viscosity caused by environmental or operational heating, the ITTEM apparatus provides a variable, but always controlled, damping-force response which responds to and can be based on the rate of an externally applied impact force and the rate of impact force change over time for that external impact force. \\n     3. In the unique ITTEM apparatus comprising the present invention, the shape and other topographical details of the piston head, as well as the chosen structural form of the intrinsic damping-force control means, can be employed to markedly alter the mode and manner of resistance to hydraulic fluid flow around the piston; as well as to initiate and affect resistance changes as a factor and function of the compressed fluid&#39;s acceleration, velocity and viscosity. \\n     4. The ITTEM apparatus allows the use of either passive and/or active structural implementations as discrete intrinsic damping-force control means. The available range of choices provides a nearly limitless degree of variance for the application of damping-force control with respect to the velocity, acceleration, and stroke length of the piston mechanism and flowing viscous hydraulic fluid being damped. \\n     5. Via the instant ITTEM apparatus, the use of low-cost and robust electronic control systems and the sensors associated with them [and/or advanced fluid-logic implementations] are available as extrinsically activated and applied damping-force control means; and the resulting damping affects effects achieved in-situ are both dynamic and reflective of real world use circumstances. \\n     Thus, the dynamic range of hydraulic fluid resistance and kinetic energy exchanges can be predicted in advance of use; and the damping system construction made dependent on any combination of fluid flow rate relative to the piston or displacement of fluid, or frequency of damper reciprocation\u2014as needed for or appropriate to the many different foreseeable applications and intended modes of operation. \\n     6. The ITTEM apparatus can completely manage the interface existing between many different kinds of mechanical and electrical systems conventionally used today and their ambient environment for a wide range of vehicles and aircraft. The present invention can be advantageously employed with many different wheeled vehicles and aircraft on the ground, and the terrain they cross \\n     Thus, the expected variety of applications today includes, but is not limited to: wheeled vehicles, such as automobiles, buses, and trucks; treaded vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks; tracked vehicles such as trolley cars, railroad cars, railed tankers, locomotives and electric trams; and aircraft such as helicopters and winged airplanes capable of landing on a ship&#39;s deck, or on a landing pad, or upon the ground; as well as being able to travel over and cross the existing terrain. \\n     7. The ITTEM apparatus provides continuous granular control\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014to vary adaptively the strength and duration of available damping-force and rebound; and is sufficient to fit the moment-by-moment and millimeter-by-millimeter upstroke and down-stroke velocities and frequencies. Moreover, in order that the amplitude and frequencies of damping be synchronous to the greatest extent possible with the up-stroke or down-stroke of the piston mechanism, these structural controls will deliver the appropriate frequencies and amplitudes of damping synchronously with the impact events being damped\u2014either passively with hydro-mechanical implementation, or via amplification modalities including but not limited to audio-type amplification chips and circuits. \\n     8. The range of alternative embodiments available for use as the ITTEM apparatus allow for a more granular effect\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014for damping of terrain-crossing kinetic events, compared with conventionally known devices and systems. In the present invention, the trace of oscillations between the sprung and unsprung weight of a vehicle is nearly or completely synchronous with the trace of damping-force; and the peaks of relative speed-of-motion between the unsprung weight/posture and the sprung weight/position of the vehicle are synchronous (or nearly so) with the peaks of damping-force applied, acid exactly (or closely) coincide in relative amplitude with the peaks of damping-force applied \\n     9. In constructing the ITTEM apparatus, the availability today of low-cost, robust electronic control systems and the sensors associated with them, as well as the use of advanced fluid-logic implementations, allows dynamic and predictive behaviors of damping systems to be implemented. The resistance of the apparatus to the expected impact force changes can be made to be dependent upon any combination of rate, displacement or frequency of impact forces as appropriate to different applications and modes of use. \\n     I. Specific Embodiments of the ITTEM Apparatus \\n     A wide and diverse range of embodiments comprising the ITTEM apparatus can be constructed. Merely representative and illustrative of the available construct alternatives are the two particular examples provided below. It is expressly understood, however, that the two embodiments presented in detail herein are neither limiting nor restrictive of the many other constructions and formats that are available to meet the particular conditions or individual needs of the intended user. \\n     As presented in great detail below, both an operative minimalist format and a far more sophisticated and complex non-minimalist format are described in sequence\u2014in order that the essential structural component parts of the invention be easily recognized and quickly distinguished from the more desirable optional structural features and additions present in the preferred constructions. As such, the two described and illustrated embodiments represent structural alternatives revealing and demonstrating the true scope and breadth of the invention. \\n     A. An Operative Minimalist Structural Format \\n       FIG. 1  shows a simple construct and minimalist embodiment of the ITTEM invention. As seen therein, the shock absorbing and damping apparatus  100  is of the cylinder and piston type. \\n     The apparatus  100  as whole comprises an elongated and hollow cylinder which appears in  FIG. 1  as a single housing  110  having an upper end wall  111  with one open end  106 , a closed lower end wall  112 , two discrete solid sidewalls  113  and  114 , and an extended internal bore volume  120 . \\n     A pressure-resistant compartment barrier  140  is transversely positioned along the axis AA\u2032 between the sidewalls  113  and  114 ; and this pressure-resistant barrier  140  divides the extended internal bore volume  120  of the cylinder housing  110  into two adjacently located separated compartments constituting a discrete gas-containing spatial region  160  and a discrete hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  170 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 1 , the pressure resistant compartment barrier  140  is a single structural entity; provides a pressure-tight fitting for the boundary of the gas-containing region  160 ; and also presents a resilient fluid-tight surface at the boundary of the hydraulic fluid-containing region  170 . \\n     For this purpose, the pressure resistant compartment barrier  140  interface lying between the fluid-containing region  170  and the gas-containing region  160  is composed of a durable and flexible, non porous material exemplified by, but not limited to, substances such as rubber, synthetic rubber, silicone elastomers, teflon, flexible metal bellows, etc. Each of these suitable materials is either slideable as an inherent attribute; or can be made in the form of a rolling boot, such as those used in conventional air-inflated ride-height-adjustable shock absorbers. \\n     The apparatus  100  also comprises a reciprocating piston mechanism  130  which is disposed and moveable throughout the extended internal bore volume  120  of the cylinder housing  110 . The piston mechanism  130  includes a displaceable piston head  132 ; a fixed piston rod (or support shaft)  134  which passes through the gas-containing region  160 , and the hydraulic fluid-containing region  170 ; and a distal end  136  of the piston rod  134  which passes through the open end  106  in the upper wall  111 . \\n     It will be recognized also that this minimalist piston mechanism  130  is depicted in  FIG. 1  as a one-part piston head; which is formed of solid matter; has only smooth exterior surfaces grid faces; and does not present or include any primary orifices or valves as such. \\n     Nevertheless, in non-minimalist embodiments, it will be clearly understood that the piston head can alternatively be comprised of multiple segments; can optionally present one or more surface faces and features which topographically are neither smooth nor regular; and can also optionally have a variety of open grooves or furrows over its exterior surfaces. \\n     Also as shown in  FIG. 1 , the displaceable piston head  132  is located within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  170 ; and the piston rod  134  is capable of up-strokes and down-strokes repeatedly over the length of the extended internal bore volume  120  of the cylinder housing  110 , and will thereby initiate movement and displacement of the piston head  132  on-demand. \\n     Disposed within the open end  106  of the upper wall  111  of the cylinder housing  110  is a thermally expandable seal  180  through which the distal end  136  of the piston rod  134  travels. The expandable seal  180  maintains the integrity of the internal bore volume  120  as the distal end  136  of the piston rod  134  travels through the open end  106  in the upper wall  111 . \\n     In addition, a gas portal  115  is disposed within the traveling distal end  136  of the piston rod  134 ; and this gas portal  115  is suitable for introducing pressurized gas into the spatial volume of the gas-containing region  260 . Not shown within  FIG. 1  is a gas valve and a source of pressurized gas which can be connected to the gas portal  115 . \\n     Via the gas portal  115 , the gas-containing spatial region  160  of the cylinder housing  110  is filled with a suitable compressible gas such as nitrogen. Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas\u2014which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke (such as a full extension) to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region  160  serves as an effective pressure reference; and, optionally, also serves as the rebounding medium for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     In this manner, the compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke direction and position) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of the cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means. In addition to its primary purpose and function, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region can also serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     In contrast, the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  170  of the invention is filled with a viscous oil (or other highly viscous liquid)\u2014such as a high-viscous silicon-based oil having semi-plastic fluid flow characteristics. The viscous hydraulic fluid is resistant to compression force; and is capable of motion within the compartment volume of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder when compression force and kinetic energy is imparted to the viscous hydraulic fluid (via the displacement of the piston head  132  within the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  170 ). \\n     Joined to and surrounding the surface of the piston rod  134  at a location adjacent to the piston head  132  is a single, substantially disc-shaped and flat surface, passive-resistance flow baffle  150 , which is one preferred passive example of the intrinsic damping-force control means employed in the present invention. As seen in  FIG. 1 , the passive-resistance flow baffle  150  is a structural entity integrally joined to the piston rod  134 ; is composed of resilient matter of a kind which will physically deform in response to the directional displacement of the piston head and the resistance offered by the wave motions of the viscous oil (or other liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; thereby either increase or decrease the quantum of hydraulic fluid resistance against the moving piston head as it travels within the bore volume of the cylinder housing\u2014the quantum and manner of resistance in question being imparted to the moving hydraulic fluid by particular direction of travel for the moving piston head within the longitudinal bore volume of the cylinder housing. In essence, therefore, the flow baffle  150  seen in  FIG. 1  will control how much damping force is applied as the viscous hydraulic fluid is pushed past it during the up-strokes and down-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism  130  within the internal bore volume  120  of the cylinder housing  110 . \\n     The disc-shaped resistance flow baffle  150  can be fashioned from a wide variety of suitable resilient materials and thermally expanding chemical formulations. In particular, the substantive material from which the resistance flow baffle  150  is made often will have specified coefficients of thermal expansion that are chosen in advance of apparatus construction; and exhibit specific coefficient of thermal expansion that matches, or is chosen to be greater than, or sometimes is less than the particular coefficient of thermal expansion of the material(s) constituting the cylinder housing  110 . The availability and desired choice of such a specific and chosen in-advance coefficient of thermal expansion for the passive-resistance flow baffle  150  allows the apparatus  100  as a whole to respond differently and alternatively to a wide range of varying operating temperatures with about the same (more or less) quantum of damping force. \\n     In addition, although a flat surfaced disc shape is deemed to be generally operative and useful as the chosen flow baffle design, it is emphatically noted here that the pre-chosen configuration for the flow baffle  150  need not necessarily be either flat surfaced or disc-shaped as such. To the contrary, the overall shape and dimensions of the passive-resistance flow baffle may be varied greatly to meet the particular needs or expected conditions of use; and each chosen variant of a resistance flow baffle shape will offer individual considerations and provide a range of substantially different flow resistance features and thermal expansion characteristics. \\n     Lastly, the apparatus  100  comprises an annular gap  190  of temperature variable size which exists as an open channel pathway between the flow baffle  150  (the passive-resistance, intrinsic damping-force control means) and each cylinder sidewall  113  and  114  present within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  170 . The annular gap  190  serves as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve; and causes temperature-differing flow rates for the moving viscous hydraulic fluid as it passes through the open channel pathway. \\n     As shown by  FIG. 1 , the annular gap  190  exists between the periphery of the flow baffle  150  and the cylinder sidewalls  113  and  114 . This annular gap functions as the peripheral valve for travel of the fluid around the piston head. Under increasing ambient or internally generated temperatures, the flow baffle  150  expands in size and into closer engagement with the cylinder wall, thereby narrowing the overall size of the annular gap  190  between the expanded flow baffle and the cylinder sidewalls. \\n     In contrast, lower ambient temperatures will cause this annular gap size to increase. Thus in these lower temperature instances, the peripheral valve resistance remains constant, regardless of fluid viscosity changes due to ambient or internally generated temperatures. \\n     Note also that damping performance is maintained via this structural arrangement, even under conditions of extreme cold or heat. Internally generated heat is created at that area of the ITTEM apparatus where ambient cooling is most available; and the peripheral valve gap, bounded on one side by the piston head and on the other side by the inner surface face of the cylinder sidewalls, allows the piston assembly to \u201csqueegee\u201d the heat up and down the cylinder wall surfaces for dissipation into the environment. This arrangement also positively manages and effectively controls the applied damping-forces quickly, in real-time requirements and durations. \\n     B. A More Sophisticated &amp; Preferred Embodiment \\n     A far more structurally elaborate and preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by  FIG. 2 . This preferred embodiment offers substantial rebound capability, as well as effective temperature compensation management features. \\n     As seen therein, the shock absorbing and damping apparatus  200  is presented which is also of the cylinder and piston type\u2014but is a construct which is markedly different in structure from the minimalist format described above. \\n     As shown by  FIG. 2 , the preferred shock absorbing and damping apparatus  200  comprises an elongated and hollow unified cylinder casing  210  which presents an elongated central bore volume  220 . However, the unified cylinder casing  210  is itself a construct of two slidable parts formed by an outer cylinder envelope  209  which surrounds a portion of and is fitted tightly over a sliding inner cylinder chamber  208 , comprising a telescoping assembly. \\n     Notably, the outer cylinder envelope  209  includes an upper wall  211  with an open end  206  and two discrete solid outer sidewalls  213  and  215 ; while the inner cylinder chamber  208  includes a closed lower wall  212  and two discrete solid inner sidewalls  214  and  216 . In addition, it will be recognized and appreciated that the outer cylinder envelope  209  typically has straight linear sidewalls  213  and  215 , while the sidewalls  214  and  216  and concomitant inner diameter of the inner cylinder chamber  208  alternatively can be either straight/linear or of varied diameter. \\n     The unified construction of the cylinder casing  210  also provides a generally elongated central bore volume  220  which is divided along the axis BB\u2032 via a pressure resistant barrier  240  into a discrete gas-containing region  260  and a discrete hydraulic fluid-containing region  270 . Furthermore, because the outer cylinder envelope  209  presents only straight/linear sidewalls  213  and  215 , the spatial volume of the gas-containing region  260  will generally be cylindrical in configuration. However, because the sidewalls  214  and  216  of the inner cylinder chamber  208  alternatively can be either straight or inclined over their linear length or any segment thereof, the spatial cavity of the hydraulic fluid-containing region  270  will often be varied in diameter size and overall configuration; and can appear as a tapering and/or cone-shaped volume, or as a non-inclining and generally cylindrically-shaped cavity space, or as a cylindrically-shaped space composed of both tapering and non-inclining segments. \\n     The preferred apparatus  200  also comprises a reciprocating piston mechanism  230  which is disposed and moveable over the linear length of the central bore volume  220  of the unified cylinder casing  210 . The piston mechanism  230  includes a multipart piston head core  232 ; and a fixed piston rod (or support rod)  234  whose linear length passes through both the gas-containing region  260  and the hydraulic fluid-containing region  270 , and whose shaft distal end  236  extends through the opening  206  in the upper end wall  211 . \\n     Disposed within the open end  206  of the upper end wall  211  of the unified cylinder casing  210  is a thermally expandable seal  280  through which the distal end  236  of the piston rod  234  travels. The expandable annular seal  280  maintains the integrity of the internal bore volume  220  as the distal end  236  of the piston rod  234  travels through the open end  206  in the upper wall  211 . \\n     In addition, a gas portal  218  is disposed within the traveling end  236  of the piston rod  234 ; and this gas portal  218  is suitable for introducing pressurized gas into the spatial volume of the gas-containing region  260 . Not shown within  FIG. 2  is a gas valve and a source of pressurized gas which can be connected to the gas portal  218 . As an alternative, the gas portal can utilize and be attached to any form of intrinsically or extrinsically controlled gas pressure valving by which to control and adjust the pressure within the gas-containing region  260 . \\n     The reciprocating piston mechanism  230  is capable of performing up-strokes and down-strokes repeatedly within said internal bore volume  210  of the unified cylinder casing  210 ; and the fixed piston rod (or support rod)  234  serves as target point of an impact contact sufficient for initiating shaft movement and concomitant displacement of the multipart piston head core  232  within the internal bore volume  220  of the unified cylinder casing  210 . \\n     As shown by  FIG. 2 , a multipart piston head core  232  lies attached to the piston rod  234 ; and this multipart piston head core is typically comprised of a single core plate  237  joined to two or more kinds of disk-shaped members which appear as a series of individual piston head segments  238  and one or more piston head caps  239 . \\n     In essence, the core plate  237  is a single disc-shaped plank upon which a series of piston head segments  238   a - 238   d  are individually joined at one surface face; and upon which one of inure styles of piston head caps  239  lie attached on the reverse surface face. The core plate  237  as such is illustrated by  FIG. 3 ; the series of individual piston head segments  238   a - 238   d  are shown in  FIG. 4 ; and the range of styled piston head caps  239   a  and  239   b  are illustrated in  FIG. 5 . \\n     As regards the configuration of the individual piston caps  239   a  and  239   b  mounted upon one surface of the core plate  237 , these caps can be fashioned into a variety of different shapes which will alternatively: (i) Change the totality of the available damping force; and/or (ii) the direction of damping force; and/or (iii) the rate of damping force then being applied; and/or (iv) the rate of change when altering the presently applied damping force. \\n     It is also recognized that it may often be more advantageous to have the rate of damping force for a shock absorbing system be markedly different for the compression stroke and extension stroke directions of the reciprocating piston mechanism. To achieve this purpose and result, a simple concave-shaped multipart piston head would provide maximum resistance for the compression stroke. In contrast however, a multipart truncated conical piston head would provide a much lower resistance and damping force rate for the compression stroke. \\n     Moreover, the rate of damping force can be meaningfully modified and altered via a multipart piston head core shaped as a truncated cone with concentric groves around it. This particular structural format for the piston head core will create predictable drag in response to any specific fluid flow rate for the moving viscous hydraulic fluid. \\n     In addition, many kinds of surface changes and face finish adaptations to the overall topography of the exterior surface for the assembled multipart piston head core may be optionally used either to increase or to decrease fluid resistance at various hydraulic fluid velocity ranges. Thus, a simple hemispherical piston head surface is often advantageous; as is a toroidally-grooved exposed surface for the assembled piston head core. Moreover, many other alternative shapes for the topography of the exterior surface are also available by which to adjust the fluid dray in order to meet and satisfy various conditions of hydraulic fluid viscosity and fluid flow rate. \\n     Accordingly, via the gas portal  218 , the gas-containing region  260  of the unified cylinder casing  210  is filled to a desired internal pressure with a compressible gas such as nitrogen. Once filled with gas to a predetermined internal pressure, the gas-containing region  260  and its compressible gas serve as an effective shock absorbing compartment for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     Attention is again emphatically directed to the particular functions provided by the gas-containing region  260 . Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas-which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region serves as a positional reference-pressure source, as an effective pressure source by which to counteract in part the shock effect caused by the impact contact forces; and, optionally, also serves as the immediate rebounding means for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     For these purposes, the compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke position and direction) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means located elsewhere within the apparatus. In addition, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region optionally can serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     In contrast, the hydraulic fluid-containing region  270  of the invention is filled with a high viscous oil (or other suitable hydraulic liquid) such as a high-viscous silicon-based oil having semi-plastic fluid flow characteristics. Then, when the impact shock event occurs, the displaced piston head core compresses the viscous fluid; causes fluidic wave motion and fluid flow within the hydraulic fluid-containing region  270 ; and the kinetic energy carried by the moving waves of viscous oil is initially resisted and controlled, and subsequently is damped and converted into heat energy. \\n     In order to maintain the integrity of the two individual regions  260  and  270  constituting the extended central bore volume  220 , a pressure resistant disc-shaped barrier  240  is employed to separate them. The pressure resistant disc-shaped barrier  240  is formed in-part as and appears within the gas-containing region  260  by as a pressure-tight fitted cap  242 ; and the separation barrier is also formed in-part as and exists within the hydraulic fluid-containing region  270  as a buffer layer  244 . Both the fitted cap  242  and the fluid-tight plate  244  are internally linked to each other to form a unitary physical barrier; and both are typically made of resilient, flexible and non porous material as described in text pertaining to  FIG. 1 , item  140 . \\n     In addition, another buffer layer  246  formed of highly-compressible resilient, flexible and non-porous material is optionally disposed adjacent to the closed lower wall  212  of the inner cylinder chamber  208 . In many instances, this optional buffer layer  246  may be formed and implemented as a hollow, inflatable-ring bladder of toroidal shape. \\n     It will be appreciated that the apparatus  200  can employ either or both passive damping-force control means and active damping-force control means as integrated components. Accordingly, joined to and surrounding a portion of the piston rod  234  at a location adjacent to the multipart piston head core  232  is a single, substantially dome-shaped flow baffle  250  constituting one embodiment of the passive-resistance flow control means. The dome shape of the passive-resistance flow baffle  250  seen in  FIG. 2  will control how much damping force is applied as the viscous hydraulic fluid is pushed past it during the up-strokes and down-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism  230  within the bore volume of the inner cylinder chamber  208 . Although only a single flow baffle appears in  FIG. 2 , it will be understood that two or more individual flow baffles may be employed simultaneously at any time. \\n     The passive-resistance flow baffle  250  will always be a structural entity located and integrally joined to that part of the piston shaft assembly  234  and  290  which is present within the compartment volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region  270 ; will be composed of resilient matter of a chemical kind and formulation which will physically deform in response to the directional displacement of the piston head and the resistance offered during compression of the viscous oil (or other liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; and will cause either an increase or a decrease in the quantum of hydraulic fluid resistance offered against the compression stroke of the moving piston head core as it travels within the bore volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region  270 \u2014the quantum and manner of fluid resistance in question offered by the moving hydraulic fluid varying with the compression force of the moving piston head core within the longitudinal bore volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region  270 . In essence, therefore, the effects of the flow baffle  250  seen in  FIG. 2  will dictate and control how much passive damping force is applied to the moving viscous hydraulic fluid which flows around and over it during the compression-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism. \\n     A wide variety of shapes for the passive-resistance flow baffle are expected and contemplated for use in order to adapt this invention for a wide range of different applications, and in order to control how much damping force is applied as the hydraulic fluid is forced past it. The flow baffle can be fashioned from many different suitable materials of known chemical formulation; and typically will have prechosen coefficients of thermal expansion that alternatively match that of the cylinder wall material, or are greater than that of the cylinder material, or are less than that of the cylinder wall material. These choices of coefficients of thermal expansion affect the capabilities of the flow baffle; and when properly selected, allow the apparatus  200  as a whole to respond to differences in operating temperature with the about the same (more or less) quantum of damping force. \\n     In addition, the passive-resistance baffle optionally may have a fluted-like perimeter edge surface\u2014i.e., a margin and side-edge topographical feature which provides different amounts of flow resistance and will vary with the details of flow interaction along Its fluted edges. Other design choices can include: a baffle segment which provides a uniform expansion space with a smoother edge. \\n     Alternatively, the flow baffle can be a segment having gear like teeth over its surfaces to provide particular flow characteristics at specified speeds of fluid flow; and optionally appear as a baffle set of two or more rotable disks having relief cuts on their perimeter edges such that each of the multiple discrete flow baffles in the set individually rotates at its own individual speed around the same piston rod in-situ. \\n     This last optional design feature deserves further description owing to its ability to rotate on-demand. In every instance, flow baffle rotation must be controlled; and such control can be achieved in alternative modes and manners. Thus, one form of control may be accomplished intrinsically in the form of a threaded piston rod and spring loading of the shaft. Alternatively, rotation control can also be accomplished extrinsically by applying force directly to a concentric rotational portion of the supporting piston rod. \\n     Each embodiment of the preferred apparatus  200  also presents and includes at least one annular gap  290  of temperature variable size/diameter-which exists as an open channel pathway between the flow baffle  250  (the passive damping-force control means) and each cylinder sidewall  214  and  216  defining the perimeter and compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region  270 . The annular gap  290  existing between the piston  290  and the cylinder wall  214  and  216  serves as a dynamically varying open channel pathway; will appear and function as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing, peripheral valve; and will allow size adjustments, including temperature-differing variations, of quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through in either direction during the up-stroke and/or down-stroke of the piston mechanism  230 . \\n     The apparatus  200  illustrated by  FIG. 2  also optionally includes (and employs in the more preferred structural formats) at least one form of extrinsically activated clamping-force control means positioned in part upon the exterior of or otherwise positioned remotely from the cylinder walls; and disposed in-part internally within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder. \\n     The extrinsically activated damping-force control means is in controlling communication with at least a portion of the piston mechanism, and is independently able to direct and to control the quantum of damping force then being applied to the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid within the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder. \\n     In many instances, prechosen activation and communication means, such as an electronic control module, are positioned and affixed externally to and remote from the unified cylinder casing  210 . The externally affixed activation and communication means are independently able to direct and control the quantum of damping force then being applied to the kinetic energy of the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid. Nevertheless, if and when required or desired, the prechosen activation and communication means, such as an electronic control module can alternatively be disposed and positioned internally anywhere within the extended bore volume of the cylinder, so long as that location does not meaningfully interfere with the other component parts of the apparatus as a whole. \\n     A desirable system of activation and communication  300  having active damping-force control means employs the electronic control module  320  shown by  FIG. 6 . As seen therein, the electronic control module  320  has an attached storage unit  321  to keep instructions, to set data points, and to record actual use conditions for later analysis. Also, the control module  320  typically includes an internal clock mechanism so that rates of change over time may be measured. \\n     As a desirable part of the extrinsically activated damping-force control means, a wide variety of measuring and recording sensors may be attached in order to gather data about performance and conditions. In the format shown by  FIG. 6 , a position sensor  322  will report the extensions of compression of the strut element. Similarly, a pressure sensor  323  will report the gas pressure at the strut valve. Other sensors can direct input from a human operator and may be imputed into the system via an option port  324 . In addition, the gas pressure in the strut  326  may be regulated by means of a pressurization system valve  325 . \\n     A range of differing active damping adjustments may also be performed with internal elements of the strut  326 , such as movable baffle plates. For this purpose, there is desirably an optional additional output port for attaching future actuators and other output mechanism to the electronic control module. Taken together these elements and components form an active control network which effectively and dynamically manages the damping performance of the control system. Since rates of change and historical data are measured, the system  300  may employ historical data to improve future performance. \\n     II. Other Structural Aspects of and Characteristic Features for the ITTEM Apparatus \\n     The minimalist and preferred embodiments set forth in detail above are merely two representative constructs illustrating the true scope and breadth of the present invention. A great many other structural variations can be individually introduced into the essential components of the ITTEM apparatus; and the present invention allows for a very wide range of alternative combinations and permutations of features in the construct&#39;s design. The range and variety of expected variations and optional modifications include all of those described subsequently herein. \\n     A. The Cylinder &amp; its Internal Bore \\n     1. In accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention, the elongated bore volume of the hydraulic cylinder housing may have a straight or tapered shape, depending upon the intended application. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, the spatial cavity of the hydraulic fluid-containing region will vary in diameter size and overall configuration; and will appear as a tapering and/or cone-shaped volume, or as a non-inclining and generally cylindrically-shaped cavity space, or as a cylindrically-shaped space composed of both tapering and non-inclining segments. \\n     2. The material substance of the cylinder itself can be one or more of the conventionally known metals, ceramics, and/or alloy composites which are chemically non-reactive, malleable, pressure-resistant, and resilient. Moreover, any of the known surface finishes including, but not limited to etching, sand-blasting, machining, fluid-dynamic boundary-layer finishes such as microperforation, and velocity-gradient moderation finishing methods such as \u201cwetting control\u201d relative to the fluid in use, may be utilized for construction of the cylinder. In this manner, the cylinder itself contributes to the individual tailoring of the damping-force by the careful choice and application of one or more of any of the known surface finishes for the metals, ceramics, and/or composites used in construction of the cylinder. \\n     3. A substantially non-absorbent, compressible fluid medium (of a type including but not limited to an inflatable-ring-bladder and/or a closed cell sponge neoprene ring) can be optionally positioned internally within the internal bore volume at one or at both end walls of the cylinder. This non-absorbent, compressible medium optionally may or may not be inflated and/or preloaded before or after full assembly of the apparatus as a whole; and when present, the non-absorbent, compressible medium positioned in the bore volume adjacent the end(s) of the cylinder will become compressed by the flowing viscous fluid (set into motion by the displaced piston head as it travels through the cylinder bore). Resistance to this flowing viscous fluid by the piston head generates substantial compression force; and concomitantly pressurizes the viscous fluid disposed in the bore volume of the cylinder, thereby limiting the formation of air bubbles. \\n     4. In some instances and embodiments one or more internal surfaces of the cylinder sidewall are serrated along its periphery or margins. These surface serrations aid in controlling the rate of flow for the moving hydraulic fluid when compressed. Accordingly, some embodiments will employ a cylinder sidewall whose surface is longitudinally-grooved along some or all of its periphery margins. \\n     5. In some format implementations of the ITTEM apparatus, the cylinder&#39;s diameter and/or roundness will vary in a non-linear fashion to produce specific damping-characteristics at specific increments of the overall stroke. \\n     Also, in other format implementations, the compartment constituting the fluid-containing spatial region and/or the compartment constituting the gas-containing spatial region will be formed as a discrete and isolatable cartridge which can be independently inserted into and then reside for an extended time period within the apparatus; and then, when necessary or desired, be able to be entirely removable on-demand from that apparatus. This particular construction mode for the ITTEM apparatus allows for quick and easy replacement of component parts\u2014a very desirable feature where very heavily use of the vehicle is the norm. \\n     6. A flexible cylinder assembly embodiment of the ITTEM apparatus, which is has come to be called the \u201cElastoSil Damper\u201d, is optionally available as a structural alternative construction to the other formats previously described herein. The major features and marked advantages of the \u201cElastoSil Damper\u201d are given below.\\n         The structure of the flexible cylinder assembly typically incorporates or affixes a flexible reservoir for the hydraulic fluid during damping and from which the fluid returns to the cylinder during rebound. Also, the flexible cylinder may or may not be optionally surrounded by a discrete flexible compressed-gas-jacket to allow adjustment of the rebound strength and ride-height.   This flexible cylinder assembly embodiment can either be a damper apparatus with limited inherent rebound from its flexible material; or be a semi-gas-adjustable standalone vehicle suspension solution, as is illustrated by  FIG. 7 .   In the latter format and construction shown by  FIG. 8 , the outer reservoir of the flexible cylinder assembly should be nearly full height and should have a compressed-gas torus jacket completely covering it. Via this structural arrangement, gaseous inflation applies pressure to the entire ElastoSil Damper apparatus; which in turn, allows such inflation to vary the load-bearing capabilities greatly for the vehicle and to adjust the ride-height of the vehicle to a smaller degree.   As an alternative choice and option, the flexible cylinder assembly construction is typically made so that the flexible reservoir for the hydraulic fluid includes at least one aperture whose gap space serves as a flow control valve and whose annular gap can be actively or mechanically varied using a tapered annular insert and an actuator or adjustment screw. The direction of taper and details of the associated baffle and mounting constitute one (but certainly not the only) effective means to control whether damping force increases with stroke speed or decreases with stroke speed in either the down-stroke or the up-stroke.   Yet another variant format is a flexible-cylinder with a convex insert, such that the maximum aperture gap is at zero-flow. This particular format increases damping with each increase of fluid flow; allows damping to be applied to both the up-stroke and the down-stroke of the piston mechanism; will cause a reverse effect and result when the smallest annular gap is set for zero-flow of fluid; and will produce decreasing damping effects with increased fluid flow/stroke-speed. For best results, the convex insert is made a part of the base-plate; and the base-plate/insert combination can be cast or otherwise manufactured in one piece for subsequent use as the heat-dissipation means.   In addition, the flexible cylinder can incorporate or have affixed a flexible reservoir for the fluid during damping and from which the fluid returns to the cylinder during rebound. Also, a flexible cylinder optionally may be surrounded by or affixed to a flexible compressed-gas-jacket to allow adjustment of the rebound strength and ride-height.   Definitionally therefore, this alternative, but highly desirable, flexible structural format is recited as follows:       \\n\\n     An inertial terrain transit event manager apparatus comprising: \\n     a flexible cylinder assembly including\\n         (i) a flexible first elongated hollow cylinder chamber having an end wall with a pre-sized opening and an associated base-plate, a closed end wall, at least two discrete flexible sidewalls, and an extended internal bore volume;   (ii) a flexible second elongated hollow cylinder shell enclosing the sidewalls of said first cylinder chamber, said second cylinder shell presenting a second extended bore volume and providing at least two nested separated hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions connected by passageways through said associated base plate at the end wall of said first cylinder chamber;   (iii) a flexible third hollow cylinder framework enclosing said sidewalls of said first and first cylinder chamber and said second cylinder shell, said flexible third cylinder framework constituting a discrete gas-containing spatial region positioned for on-demand application of pressurized gas to compress said nested separated hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions of said enclosed second cylinder shell;       \\n\\n     a fixed piston mechanism disposed and affixed to said base-plate of the extended internal bore volume of said cylinder assembly, said piston mechanism being comprised of\\n         (\u03b1) a piston head located within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions, and   (\u03b2) a base plate supporting said piston mechanism and containing an aperture valve with fluid flow passages connecting the first and second hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions via the gap space of said aperture valve;       \\n\\n     a viscous hydraulic fluid capable of motion disposed within the compartment volumes of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions of said cylinder assembly, wherein compression force and kinetic energy is imparted to said viscous hydraulic fluid via the displacement of said piston head within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region; \\n     a compressible gas held at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume said gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder assembly; \\n     intrinsic damping-force control means joined to that portion of said piston located within the compartment volume of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of said cylinder assembly, wherein said intrinsic damping-force control means is comprised of \\n     a preformed article which\\n         (i) has known dimensions and configuration,   (ii) is fashioned of a deformable material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion,   (iii) is able to absorb the resistance of said viscous hydraulic fluid when compressed within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region,   (iv) is able to impart changes to the flow angle and flow rate of said viscous hydraulic fluid within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region,   (v) is sufficient to convert at least a portion of the kinetic energy then present in said flowing viscous hydraulic fluid into heat, and   an annular gap of temperature variable size located between said preformed article and each cylinder sidewall of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region, said annular gap serving as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve which allows temperature-differing quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through during the up-stroke and down-stroke movement of said piston mechanism; and       \\n\\n     extrinsically activated damping-force control means positioned in-part externally to said cylinder assembly and disposed in-part internally within the compartment volume of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of said cylinder assembly, said extrinsically applied damping-force control means being in controlling communication with that portion of said piston, and being able to independently direct and control the quantum of damping force then being applied to the kinetic energy of said flowing viscous hydraulic fluid. \\n     B. The Piston Mechanism \\n     1. The piston head of the piston mechanism can alternatively be: a solid construction without primary orifices or valve openings in the piston head; or a piston head having a variety of features over its exposed surfaces and faces. Exemplary instances of the latter situation include the nesting of similar or different peripheral-valve implementations, such as a nested piston in a receptacle on the piston face; or a flexible cylinder peripheral valve damper affixed to one or both piston faces. \\n     Also, in accordance with the invention, the piston head can alternatively be formed as a single article structure or a unified multipart core entity. \\n     2. In addition, the topography of the compression-stroke surface face of said piston can be flat surfaced or pre-configured. When the face surface is to be configured, the particular shape for the exposed surface can be selected from one or a combination of shapes selected from the group consisting of: helical, conic, domed, concave, parabolic doomed, parabolic concave, and concave torodial, and concave-Flat \u201cPle-Pan\u201d\u2014the last for the creation of rotating toroidal \u201cSmoke-Ring\u201d vortexes at the piston-face surfaces. \\n     This wide range and variety of optional surface face shapes provide additional effective means for tailoring the passive minima and maxima of the damping-force, and the damping-rate, as well as for controlling the damping-force distribution over the range of piston stroke and acceleration of stroke, as well as for managing the effectiveness of conversion of kinetic energy into heat. \\n     3. The application of one or more known surface finishes for the metals, ceramics, and composites used in construction of the piston head provide additional means for tailoring the passive minima and maxima of damping-force and damping-rate and damping-force distribution over the ITTEM apparatus&#39; range of stroke and acceleration of stroke. This is achieved by using the above-mentioned choices of surface finishes and shapes in combination to control vortex formation (including but not limited to ring-vortex formation at the piston faces), velocity-gradient, laminar and turbulent flow, and other fluidic and/or surface-effects that influence friction, drag, and other fluidic factors which influence the damping and rebounding characteristics of an ITTEM. \\n     4. The piston rod or rod can optionally be formed as either a solid metal article or as a hollow metal member. One highly desirable implementation of the hollow piston rod format is illustrated by  FIG. 8 , which shows both an elastosil piston-buffer and a nested piston peak-pressure limiter. \\n     The elastosil piston-buffer is merely one format implementation of the flexible-cylinder peripheral valve damper. In contrast, the nested piston peak-pressure limiter is a floating piston nested within the primary piston; and has a position within the tapered bore in that primary piston which is controlled by a constant-force spring mechanism, so that movement of the nested piston only occurs when stroke-ward face transient peak pressure exceeds a preset threshold value. \\n     It will be noted and appreciated that, in formats of the present invention using a hollow piston rod, it is requires the piston rod be substantially larger in girth or diameter size; and additionally employ the hollow piston rod in a constant-volume chamber and open to the gas-pressurized region of the cylinder. This mode of construction will provide a larger sized, fully-compressed gas volume for the tailoring of the compression-stroke effects upon the gas and/or the hydraulic fluid\u2014in that it allows engineering control over the ratio between minimum full-extension and maximum full-compression gas pressure. Furthermore, this form of construction allows marked weight-savings for the piston rod itself; and because of internal pressurization within the hollow rod, it is far more buckle-resistant for any given linear length and material weight. \\n     Optionally, a bellows assembly may also be affixed to the hollow-piston-rod as a source of reference-pressure, to communicate with the piston mechanism through the hollow piston rod. The use for and value of this optional bellows assembly is the determination of load and fraction of stroke remaining, and/or to provide additional rebound/normalization capability. \\n     5. In addition, if and when a hollow piston rod format and construction is chosen, this construction can optionally also use an internally-telescoping upper member which allows for overall height adjustment on-demand for the piston rod. One format of this optional feature is a turn-buckle arrangement located near the upper attachment point; and is provided with lock-nuts for each end of the turn-buckle, so that the height adjustment (kneeling) can be locked with complete rigidity. \\n     The ability to mechanically lower the ride-height of a vehicle, such as a helicopter or ground vehicle, in the fashion described above, is highly prized within military applications where the vehicle or aircraft in question must present a lower profile for space requirements aboard a transport aircraft for effective use of the cargo space. This structural format allows the lowering of ride-height while retaining suspension in order that the loading and unloading of the lowered vehicle from its air transport retains suspension protection from bottoming-out-impacts which could damage the lowered vehicle. \\n     6. It is often desirable that the piston head or its associated structures further comprise at least one side-load bearing member which has one or more recesses of determined size and shape disposed in an outer peripheral edge thereof in order to allow bushing-like contact by the side-load bearing member to the cylinder wall without blocking fluid flow. This is needed to retain concentricity of the piston-body and shaft with the cylinders comprising the damper, against side loads, including applications such as Macpherson Strut type suspension where the damper provides the axis of steering, serving as the steering pivot as well as a damper. \\n     7. The piston mechanism as a whole is a solid construction which optionally can comprise multiple discrete piston segments, which may be fixed or mobile units relative to each other; and may be formed as nested units, or serially stacked units, or be an arranged organization of both nested and serially stacked units. Consequently, all combinations and permutations of nested and/or serially stacked piston segments\u2014regardless of their size, number, or structural complexity\u2014lie within the scope of the present invention. \\n     8. In many preferred embodiments, the piston head will optionally includes a thermal expansion member. The thermal expansion member can be a separate segment of the piston; or it can be formed as a baffle made of an appropriate thermally expansive material. \\n     Accordingly, the fully constructed piston head optionally may have one or more thermal expansion members attached to it; and also optionally includes one or more controllable (passively or actively by heat, pressure, or fluid-flow rate) fluid-flow-restrictive members; and optionally additionally have one or more discrete baffle members associated therewith, each such optionally present baffle member being actively or passively deformable in response to the flow movement of the silicone oil or other hydraulic fluid. It is noteworthy that with each of these optional, but highly desirable structural formats, the size of the annular gap will either increase or decrease\u2014the specific change in question being imparted by the dynamic flow of the fluid (and directional movement of the piston stroke within the extended bore volume of the cylinder), and the operating temperature(s) at which the apparatus is used. \\n     9. Many constructions of the inertial terrain transit event manager apparatus will exemplify the particular circumstance where the piston head and the cylinder are formed of materials having substantially equal coefficients of thermal expansion. In the alternative, however, many embodiments will present constructs in which where the piston head or its optionally present thermally-expanding member, and the cylinder, are formed of materials having markedly different coefficients of thermal expansion. \\n     In these circumstances, the material substances are chosen so that the fluid displacement for a given damper-stroke or fraction thereof will produce the same or nearly the same damping, regardless of environmental temperature variations or fluid and damper temperature variations engendered by extreme damping activity. The materials chosen for the piston head or its optionally present thermally-expanding member, will in this case, have a greater thermal coefficient of expansion than the substance forming the cylinder. Consequently, as the operational temperature rises and the hydraulic fluid becomes less viscous, the thermally-expanding member (such as a baffle) will expand at a greater rate than the material substance of the cylinder, thus reducing the size of the annular gap (peripheral valve) and thereby constricting its valving function to produce the same resistance and damping with the warmed fluid as it did with the cooler fluid. \\n     10. In some use instances and applications, the piston head will comprise an appropriately-shaped retaining member, and a piston or piston-segment member, with a thermal expansion member interdisposed between them. Typically, the appropriately-shaped retaining member, and the piston or piston-segment member, are made of a pre-selected material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion which is less than or equal to that of the thermal expansion member and/or similar to the cylinder. \\n     In the alternative, there are a number of use conditions under which the thermal expansion member is selected to have a coefficient of thermal expansion greater than the conical-shaped leading member and the load-bearing element. \\n     11. The piston mechanism of the ITTEM apparatus optionally may comprise and include one or more adjacently disposed segments having serrated or longitudinal grooves or a series of baffles with serrations in their periphery. Typically, the grooved or serrated periphery face surfaces of the segments or baffles lie exposed within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing region; are longitudinally moveable by associated springy or elastic mechanisms such as elastomeric o-rings, and are radially moveable as well, thereby allowing them to function as a baffle. \\n     The means and control for causing such radial movement is provided by interfacing the series of adjacently disposed segments or baffles to each other using a spiral-spline shaft which extends from the disk-surface of one of the segments and/or baffles to engage a slip-fitting spiral-spline socket in the adjacent segment and/or baffle; or by additional springy or elastic means joined to the segment or baffle, and which can be provided by the intrinsic elasticity of the baffle material itself. \\n     The series of segments and baffles are specifically aligned; and function, when the system is at rest, to vary the alignment of the grooves or serrations of one segment or baffle to those of the next segment or baffle of the series in response to fluid-flow and pressure, over a range from fully-aligned to fully occluded/misaligned. Thus, if and when occluded, the peripheral fluid-flow through the grooves or serrations in the series of segments and baffles would be nearly occluded for great damping force; and alignment of the grooves or serrations would allow considerably more fluid-flow for a softer damping-force. In the case of spiral grooves or serrations the alignment-occlusion can be accomplished without a spiral-spline arrangement. \\n     C. The Hydraulic Fluid-Containing Spatial Region \\n     1. The compartment volume of the fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder is filled with a slightly compressible silicone-based fluid of elevated viscosity which preferably exhibits pseudo-plastic flow under extreme shear; and which desirably can be blended at will into viscous fluids having a viscosity ranging from about 10 centistokes to about 600,000 centistokes; and which will preferably have a viscosity temperature coefficient below about 0.6. \\n     2. A highly preferred hydraulic fluid is polydimethylsiloxane silicone fluid which exhibits the desired characteristics and properties. A commercially available polydimethylsiloxane silicone fluid is 200(R), 50 CST hydraulic fluid manufactured and sold by Dow Corning Corporation. Many similar commercially sold hydraulic fluids are also commonly known and available. \\n     3. It is desirable that a non-absorbent and compressible medium, of a type including but not limited to an inflatable-toroidal-diaphragm and/or a closed cell sponge neoprene ring, is optionally provided within the compartment volume of the hydraulic-fluid region, at either or both ends of the chamber. When present, this non-absorbent, compressible medium may or may not be inflated as such; can alternatively be preloaded before or after apparatus assembly; and when present can be compressed by the flowing hydraulic fluid as it travels within the cylinder. The resistance of the non-absorbent, compressible medium to this compression force serves to pressurize the hydraulic-fluid containing compartment, thus limiting the formation of air bubbles. \\n     Also, in accordance with alternative embodiments of the ITTEM apparatus, the cylinder may have a internal bore configuration of constant or varied diameter, depending upon the application and intended use circumstances. \\n     D. The Gas-Containing Spatial Region \\n     1. The gas-containing region and its compressible gas serve as an effective shock absorbing compartment for the apparatus as a whole. Attention is emphatically directed to the particular functions provided by the gas-containing region. Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas\u2014which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region serves as a positional reference-pressure source, as an effective pressure source by which to counteract in part the shock effect caused by the impact contact forces; and, optionally, also serves as the immediate rebounding means for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     2. In all typical and complete embodiments of the ITTEM apparatus, a compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke position and direction) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means located elsewhere within the apparatus. In addition, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region optionally can serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole. \\n     This structural rule and circumstance holds true for each format of the ITTEM apparatus as a whole. However, there are in reality two recognized and expected exceptions to this general rule, which are: Those specialized circumstances such as the retrofit of a vehicle which compels or allows for only the use of a conventionally known shock absorber as a replacement; and those particular kinds of vehicles where the existing rebounding mechanism in place (such as a metal spring mechanism) precludes the use of any gas rebounding apparatus in any form. In these instances, the presently described ITTEM apparatus as such cannot be usefully employed. \\n     3. The compressed gas contained within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region is a rebounding medium. A rebounding medium has a specific stored energy; and, in the case of a compressed gas, is measurable as a specific pressure. Direct sensing of that internal gaseous pressure (as well as the transient pressure-rise at the strokeward face of the piston) allows the piston to intrinsically respond to the actual sink-rate and the actual inertial load; and to configure itself for the appropriate damping based on those factors and the remaining stroke length available to damp the kinetic fraction of the current inertial load; thereby delivering the preferred deceleration solution which is to apply a constant deceleration force for the remaining stroke length or part thereof in order to reach zero piston velocity at or before the end point of available stroke-length. \\n     E. The Intrinsic Damping Control Means \\n     1. In each embodiment of the ITTEM apparatus, structural intrinsic damping-force control means are integrally joined to that portion of said piston mechanism located within the internal bore volume of the cylinder. As a consequence of being located within the cylinder volume, the intrinsic damping-force control means can be constructed as either passive structural entities or active structural devices. Thus, a free choice exists and is available between the passive and active formats. \\n     2. By definition, a passive form of intrinsic damping-force control means is a hydrodynamic, and/or flexural, and/or mechanical construct able to respond to variations of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and/or piston position within the cylinder. Such passive intrinsic damping-force control means produce the required damping without external reference. \\n     As the alternative model, an active form of intrinsic damping-force control means is, by definition, electronically referenced to the damper&#39;s internal environmental variations of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and/or piston position within the cylinder. As such, the electronic module or other electro-mechanical controlling device will always be located in-situ and be positioned to exert fluid flow control internally within the available bore volume of the cylinder; will electronically and/or electro-mechanically activate and engage the passive Intrinsic structural formats in order to produce and control the required damping force; and are capable of interacting with or referencing one or more inputs sent from sources located outside of and/or remotely from the bore volume of the cylinder. \\n     3. Accordingly, structurally and without regard to type or manner of construction, each and every format of intrinsic damping-force control means will comprise:\\n         A preformed article which\\n           (i) has known dimensions and configuration,   (ii) is fashioned of a deformable material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion,   (iii) is able to absorb the resistance of said viscous silicone-based fluid when compressed within the hydraulic fluid-containing region,   (iv) is able to impart changes to the flow angle and flow rate of said viscous hydraulic fluid when compressed within the hydraulic fluid-containing region,   (v) is sufficient to convert at least a portion of the kinetic energy then present in the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid into heat; and   \\n           An annular gap of dynamically adjustable and temperature variable size located between said reformed article and each cylinder sidewall of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region, the annular gap serving as a lower-temperature size expanding and higher-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve which allows dynamically altered and temperature differing quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through during the up-stroke and down-stroke movement of the piston mechanism.       \\n\\n     4. Among the many structural formats available and suitable for use as the chosen Intrinsic damping-force control means, one highly preferred instance and example are fluid-flow restrictive members\u2014which typically appear as one or more baffle-like articles, with or without an electronically activated supporting side-load bearing member. \\n     These baffle-like articles can be a separate component attached to the piston rod, or be a formed feature on a face surface of the piston head, or be disposed upon and attached to an internal surface face of the cylinder sidewalls. \\n     Typically, each baffle-like article is: \\n     (i) a discrete structural feature of predetermined dimensions and overall configuration; \\n     (ii) desirably is integrally joined to a portion of the piston rod; \\n     (iii) is fashioned and constituted of a chemically stable and resilient formulation; \\n     (iv) is tangibly deformable in-situ when responding to the flowing wave motions of the viscous oil (or other viscous liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; and \\n     (v) will thereby either increase or decrease the hydraulic fluid resistance within the cylinder\u2014the mode of fluid flow resistance modification in question being imparted to the moving hydraulic fluid by the particular direction of the traveling piston head (during the down-stroke and the up-stroke) within the elongated bore volume of the cylinder. \\n     5. The annular gap comprising part of the intrinsic damping-force control means will always have a perimeter edge of measurable spatial size (or diameter); and will always exist as a discernible entity between the periphery of the fluid-flow restrictive member (typically a baffle-like article) and the cylinder sidewalls or the piston. This annular gap will spatially act as a peripheral valve\u2014i.e., a sized gateway or controlled portal for open channel flow travel of the comp, ebbed hydraulic fluid around the piston head. \\n     The perimeter size (diameter or width dimension) of the annular gap can and will vary over the scale of fractions of the individual damping stroke; and will be a function of the hydrodynamic and flexural variations in the baffle-like article&#39;s shape and performance\u2014based on the expected changes of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and piston stroke position within the cylinder bore. The expansion and contractions of perimeter size for the annular gap will produce the desired damping effects. \\n     In addition, the perimeter size (diameter or width) of the annular gap is only limited by the configuration of the baffle-like article and the piston&#39;s cylindrical surface (including its leading and trailing edges). Thus, the perimeter edge and overall spatial size of the annular gap can be prepared and set to be of constant or varied dimension. This capability allows and enables the open channel pathway to accommodate and meaningfully control extremely large variations of fluid-flow speed and fluid flow direction for any given stroke-position and speed of piston motion relative to the hydraulic fluid. \\n     6. Note that under increasing ambient or internally generated operating temperatures, the preformed baffle article (or other fluid-flow resistance means) becomes increasingly heated, thermally expands, and dimensionally grows into ever-closer adjacent proximity with the internal surface of the solid cylinder sidewalls; and thereby will markedly narrow the overall size/diameter for the open channel pathway of the annular gap then existing between the preformed baffle article and the cylinder sidewall. \\n     Conversely, the occurrence of lower ambient operating temperatures will cause this annular gap to increase in aperture size/diameter; and thereby offer a larger-sized open channel pathway for a more rapid flow of the viscous hydraulic fluid passing through. Under these operational circumstances and in this manner, the overall resistance provided by the intrinsic damping-force control means to fluidic flow remains substantially constant, regardless of hydraulic fluid viscosity changes caused by ambient or internally generated operating temperatures. \\n     7. Consequently, damping performance for the apparatus is consistently and uniformly maintained under all realistic operating conditions, even under extremes of cold and heat. It will be noted also that the internally generated heat is centered and focused at that zone of the ITTEM apparatus where ambient cooling is most available; and the thermally expanding annular gap allows the piston assembly to convert the kinetic energy of impact and vibration into heat by hydrodynamic means at the interface between the piston/baffle system, avoiding significant heating of the bulk silicone fluid by \u201csqueegeeing\u201d the heat up and down the cylinder wall surfaces for dissipation into the environment. \\n     F. Extrinsically Activated Damping-Force Control Means \\n     1. When optionally present, the extrinsically activated damping-force control means will be in part internally positioned within the internal bore volume of the cylinder, and in-part remotely located from the piston mechanism of the ITTEM apparatus. The extrinsic activation and communication controls, such as the electronic module shown by  FIG. 6 , will always lie at a fixed or known distance away and are separated from the cylinder; but will be in on-demand and active control communication with the implementation devices then disposed internally within the bore volume of the cylinder. The exact location of these remotely positioned electronic controls will vary with the particulars of the electronics chosen and the specific application requirements. \\n     2. The extrinsically activated damping-force control means can be integrated with a variety of devices and structures then located and implemented within the internal bore volume of the cylinder, for operation remotely. Merely exemplifying these internally located implementation devices are the following: \\n     (i) A piezoelectric ring located around the piston head which expands radially when activated; \\n     (ii) A piezoelectrically-valved, inflatable-ring peripheral orifice choke working off differential pressure from one side of the piston to the other\u2014with the result that a large hydro mechanical force is controlled by the electronics; \\n     (iii) One or more configured \u201cmission-adaptive\u201d composite baffle structures which can be activated on-demand and purposefully directed to become either more curved or less curved in radial shape and orientation, and thus be either increased or decreased in topographical contact surface distance to meet different rates of viscous fluid flow. \\n     3. Owing to the nature of electronic controlling devices and systems, a source of reliable electric power must be provided for operational acts. For superior damping results, the desirable electric power source(s) for activating and operating the extrinsically activated damping-force control means can take various forms, such as super capacitors; storage batteries; and other well known conventional energy sources. These electric power sources typically are fixed either externally to the ITTEM apparatus; or are positioned internally within the interior bore volume of the cylinder in the ITTEM apparatus, at pre-chosen multiple locations, including but not limited to the piston mechanism. \\n     In addition, the true source of electric power can take one or more alternative forms, including rotary brushless generator/alternator devices associated with the piston mechanism and spun by \u201crifling\u201d to catch fluid-flow (tailor-made for dual-piston and elongated piston implementations. For example, in a linear-reciprocating generation embodiment, one or more discrete magnets can be positioned upon the outside of the lower \u201cmoving\u201d leg of the strut, or the strut itself can be magnetized; or a magnetized spring is positioned below the piston head. Any of these alternative models will allow the generation of power on the piston using a coil and a rectifier. \\n     4. The controlling electronics, located either externally or internally within the ITTEM apparatus itself, enables granularity for the system; and makes the sensing and the processing of data space-wise and time-wise local to the events. This, in turn, provides quick detection of fluid flow changes and allows the processing of detected data to be very rapid and time-effective; and results in the electronically controlled system to meet and effectively manage the quickly changing shock impact event(s), namely the synchronization of damping speed and damping intensity with the piston stroke movement. \\n     In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the physical implementation of the algorithm governing the ITTEM apparatus as a whole may include a control mechanism implementing a mechanical negative feedback control loop to expand or contract the baffle\u2014and thereby seek a particular fluid pressure regardless of travel speed as a way of providing a uniform damping force from beginning of movement to zero velocity at the end of the stroke. \\n     5. An on-demand electronic controlling system can be prepared, interconnected, and networked via conventional electrical linking means including: radio, wires, optical fibers, and even swarming methods; and usefully function as an operative system including the capability to modify behavior performance based on the previous shock&#39;s experience of the road; as well as interact with the vehicle&#39;s other on-board systems to preemptively damp effectively for an upcoming event (like a missile launch or a detected blast wave, etc.). \\n     As merely one truly unusual example, an appropriate ITTEM apparatus and system capable of actually jumping away from and minimizing (if not completely avoiding) the injurious effects of an explosive detonation would employ a ride-height implementation control structure which is automated and may be decoupled from the spring function of the vehicle\u2014thereby reducing the relative velocity of the explosive blast wave and the segment of the blast zone to which the vehicle is exposed, while also increasing distance from the blast center, based on detection equipment signals. \\n     III. Modes of Damping Provided by the Present Invention \\n     A. The ITTEM apparatus can act to provide a variety of damping capabilities which are functionally unique and can be separated into four alternative modes of damping. All of these modes exist simultaneously; and all these modes function (with some variation in overlap characteristics) transitioning from mode to mode automatically with increases or decreases in fluid flow velocity. However, which of these appears as the \u201cdominant\u201d mode of the moment is a function of and dependent upon the particular fluid flow velocity then in effect. \\n     This is one the major features of and distinguishing differences for the ITTEM apparatus in comparison to most conventionally known damping devices, all of which are position or displacement dependent. The ITTEM apparatus most notably is independent of displacement, but is unusually sensitive and completely reactive to even very small changes in the velocity of fluid flow. \\n     B. The four alternative modes of damping are: \\n     (1) Velocity Squared Damping \\n     With this damping mode, for every incremental increase in fluid flow velocity, the resistive force increases as a \u201csquare\u201d of the increment of increase relative to the initial velocity. For example, if the velocity increases by a factor of 2, the delta damping force increase is a magnitude four (4) times greater than the original. \\n     (2) Viscous Damping \\n     In this mode, for each incremental increase in flow velocity, there is a resulting linear effective increase of resistive force. Thus, the resistive force is produced by the size (typically the piston cross-sectional area) of the object being forced through the damping medium. The force is also then, a factor of the viscosity of the damping medium. This mode appears and is functional in the upper range of subsonic flow and extends to a lower mid-range of velocities. \\n     (3) Dashpot Damping \\n     Dashpot damping is best understood by thinking of the classic screen door dampers that were intended to slow the motion of the door and to lessen the impact force when the door hit the door jam. Thus, at the slowest fluid flow velocities, the device acts as a dashpot, resembling a classic \u201cscreen door\u201d damper. Because this mode becomes dominant at slower rates of fluid flow, it resembles pushing a flat faced plunger through highly viscous fluid, thus producing resistive force. \\n     (4) Machian Damping \\n     Machian damping relates to the transonic and faster-flow characteristics from subsonic to supersonic flow, from supersonic to hypersonic flow. Specifically, the transition from subsonic flow to supersonic or higher Machian flow is a speed-dependent damping-force component\u2014in that during the Machian regime of fluid flow, the resistance increases with speed. This holds true for each transition; and thus demonstrates that a piston made so as to have more than one region where the annular gap increases (slowing fluid speed) and then decreases again (causing another subsonic-Machian transition)\u2014will have more than one Machian source of damping. \\n     Where the bow-wave or shockwave entrains within the annular gap (in the case of fluid-flow rates greater than 1) and bounces multiple times before exiting the gap, at even fairly slow strokes, this event forms a variably-permeable virtual seal which spans the annular gap; and constitutes the standing wave/mach-cone and related high-mach-number events occurring in the fluid passing the piston and its valving members. It is also clear that higher-mach-number events such as standing waves formed in flow-channels including but not limited to the annular space can be used as flow control and flow diverters which are velocity-dependent, since at a given mach number the standing waves are repeatable as to position and shape. Thus fluid-logic and switching based on the standing waves allows a much finer, more granular\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014control of the ITTEM&#39;s high-speed damping characteristics. \\n     Switching from low-speed damping (where the fluid-flow through the adaptive damping-means is subsonic) to transonic-supersonic can be hydrodynamically initiated and controlled by means including but not limited to the coanda effect and it&#39;s breakdown as fluid speed approaches the transonic value and higher. \\n     In the Machian and fractional-mach regimes, the fluid passing the annular gap exhibits many useful characteristics which can be directed by those skilled in the hydrodynamic and damping sciences and arts to tailor damping evidenced by the ITTEM, characteristics including but not limited to laminar and turbulent flow, as well as piston-face-following coanda flow, in varying combinations according to the specific tailoring of the ITTEM and its current fluid-flow rate; the mach-cone waves also serve to efficiently transform kinetic impact-energy into heat, \u201cabsorbing shocks\u201d and dissipating that kinetic energy as heat locally through the shell of the cylinder. \\n     IV. Exemplary Active and Passive Damping Means Effective for Managing the Exchange of Kinetic Energy \\n     The listing of Table 1 given below identifies some of the more desirable, but certainly not all, of the active and/or passive structural means which can be employed in differing embodiments of the ITTEM apparatus for managing the exchange of kinetic energy between the sprung condition and unsprung posture of a vehicle. It will be clearly understood, however, that the entire listing of Table 1 is merely exemplary and representative of such active and passive damping means; and that the particulars of the listing neither limits or restricts in any way the range and variety of particular structures and articles which may be operationally employed for this particular purpose. \\n     \\n       \\n         \\n               \\n             \\n                 TABLE 1 \\n               \\n                   \\n               \\n                 Piezoelectric active damping compensation controlled locally by \\n               \\n                 electronics on the piston mechanism itself. \\n               \\n                 Micro-mechanical active damping compensation controlled locally \\n               \\n                 by electronics on the piston mechanism itself. \\n               \\n                 External tube connecting the ends of the piston travel space from \\n               \\n                 points at or beyond the maximum travel of the piston. These \\n               \\n                 allow active control of damping characteristics externally by \\n               \\n                 controlling restriction at the tube, as well as augmented cooling \\n               \\n                 of the fluid moving through the tube. \\n               \\n                 Use of a hollow piston rod where the flowing hydraulic fluid \\n               \\n                 enters a hollow piston rod from the end bolted through the \\n               \\n                 piston head, and fills the linear length of the hollow piston rod \\n               \\n                 with viscous fluid. This structural format allows significant \\n               \\n                 weight savings; and enables the hollow piston rod to effectively \\n               \\n                 resist buckling under compressive forces-with significantly less \\n               \\n                 wall thickness for the rod itself, since it becomes pressurized and \\n               \\n                 thus serves as an aid to resisting bucking during the down- \\n               \\n                 stroke. Note also that by being in tension on the upstroke, \\n               \\n                 buckling is not an issue during the up-stroke. \\n               \\n                 In some embodiments, a coil spring is contained within the \\n               \\n                 cylinder bore volume between the exterior surface of the piston \\n               \\n                 head and the end wall of the cylinder. The coil spring is \\n               \\n                 employed for suspension/rebound management; and/or as a \\n               \\n                 component of the energy-harvesting system; and/or in the case \\n               \\n                 of a tubular coil spring, as a channel space for hydraulic fluid to \\n               \\n                 travel from the non-spring side of the piston head to the end \\n               \\n                 wall of the cylinder-where another active or passive fixed \\n               \\n                 peripheral valve assembly can further moderate the fluid flow, \\n               \\n                 allowing that ITTEM embodiment to have two separate and \\n               \\n                 distinct modes of damping. \\n               \\n                 In those embodiments with on-board electronic controls, some \\n               \\n                 electronic formats are able to network through wires, optical \\n               \\n                 fibers, or wirelessly, with one or more other modes of damping \\n               \\n                 then affixed to the vehicle in question; as well as network with \\n               \\n                 the vehicle&#39;s on-board electronics (which may include various \\n               \\n                 sensors and computers) in order to optimize damping \\n               \\n                 characteristics for the current environment; and to vary damping \\n               \\n                 synchronously, or asynchronously, or both in order to prevent \\n               \\n                 uncomfortable and/or destructive resonances from occurring in \\n               \\n                 the vehicle and/or its sensitive components. \\n               \\n                 Units for actively sensing and remembering, over specified time \\n               \\n                 durations, dominant frequencies of oscillation or resonance \\n               \\n                 between the sprung and unsprung components and preemptively \\n               \\n                 damping at those frequencies. These control units can also \\n               \\n                 optionally offset the damping effect for a particular frequency \\n               \\n                 one half wave from the use frequency; and/or optionally \\n               \\n                 frequency-double the damping activity, so that ten (10) Hertz \\n               \\n                 oscillation would be damped at 20 Hertz (in real world situations, \\n               \\n                 earth terrain is a rectifier; and up and down motion are both \\n               \\n                 motions needing control). \\n               \\n                 For the case where the piston head is mechanically affixed to \\n               \\n                 move with the unsprung weight of the vehicle, the use of \\n               \\n                 mechanical inertial means is very desirable. Such mechanical \\n               \\n                 Inertial means incorporate at least a freely moveable weight \\n               \\n                 within the piston mechanism which mechanically chokes the \\n               \\n                 upper baffle at the beginning of upstroke to a degree dependent \\n               \\n                 on the transient acceleration; an event at which choking is \\n               \\n                 locked in place by the relative overpressure on the upward side \\n               \\n                 during the upstroke with a camera shutter-release-like locking \\n               \\n                 mechanism that only unlocks at near pressure balance between \\n               \\n                 the upper and lower sides of the piston. This format locks in a \\n               \\n                 prechosen rate of damping for the upstroke which is based on \\n               \\n                 the initial sink rate. \\n               \\n                 In the case of the piston being affixed to move with the sprung \\n               \\n                 weight of the vehicle, the inertial sensing should be set at the \\n               \\n                 unsprung weight, most practically making use of a hollow coil \\n               \\n                 conduit. In this instance, as well as and the last case presented \\n               \\n                 above, the annular gap size and its peripheral valving effect \\n               \\n                 should be the maximum damping setting. Then, with the coil \\n               \\n                 conduit or/and maximal open channel pathway space, the \\n               \\n                 damping action should be set at the least value available, so that \\n               \\n                 the inertial valve creates the difference between maximum and \\n               \\n                 minimum damping based on unsprung-weight acceleration. It \\n               \\n                 will be noted and appreciated also that this is an application \\n               \\n                 suitable for locally-powered electronics as well as for mechanical \\n               \\n                 options. \\n               \\n                 For washer-like baffles, the chosen embodiments can be either \\n               \\n                 flat or convex in configuration; and if convex, the structures can \\n               \\n                 be radially corrugated and affixed to both faces of the piston rod \\n               \\n                 so that, parachute-like, they engage the relative stream of fluid \\n               \\n                 approaching the respective faces. This format allows the \\n               \\n                 compression force to enlarge their inner diameter during that \\n               \\n                 portion of the stroke where the fluid flows toward that exposed \\n               \\n                 face of the piston head-the object and result being rate-and- \\n               \\n                 direction-adaptive damping induced by varying the peripheral \\n               \\n                 valve orifice size and laminar-parasitic-friction-drag \\n               \\n                 characteristics. \\n               \\n                 Differing baffles can be arranged in series and in particular \\n               \\n                 sequence in order to produce specific damping characteristics. \\n               \\n                 The sequential progressions of baffles can include but are not \\n               \\n                 limited to: a first flat or slightly parachute-like baffle with fairly \\n               \\n                 constant low-speed damping, which is arranged to block flow to \\n               \\n                 a second and substantially more parachute-like baffle-until the \\n               \\n                 hydraulic fluid flow speed forces the first baffle to decrease \\n               \\n                 diameter, thereby allowing fluid flow to engage the second, \\n               \\n                 substantially more parachute-like baffle. This series of baffles \\n               \\n                 dramatically increases the damping-force. \\n               \\n                 Another desirable embodiment is a series of convex-shaped \\n               \\n                 baffles in sequence, each of which is radially corrugated and \\n               \\n                 affixed to both faces of the piston head-so that, nosecone-like, \\n               \\n                 the baffle series engages the relative stream of fluid approaching \\n               \\n                 their respective faces. This format allows that the flowing force \\n               \\n                 of the hydraulic fluid to deform and decrease the baffles&#39; \\n               \\n                 diameter size during that portion of the stroke where the fluid \\n               \\n                 flows toward that particular surface face of the piston head; the \\n               \\n                 object and result of this construction being rate-and-direction- \\n               \\n                 adaptive damping caused by varying the peripheral valve orifice \\n               \\n                 size and laminar-parasitic-friction-drag characteristics. \\n               \\n                 If the baffle structures are radially corrugated, springy washers \\n               \\n                 (very stiff vertically, but springy in terms of increasing diameter \\n               \\n                 size) can be set around an inner ring/band (which might be \\n               \\n                 corrugated shim stock); these corrugations running vertically \\n               \\n                 and arranged so that pressure from either side of the piston \\n               \\n                 head pushes that inner ring outward-thereby shoving the \\n               \\n                 baffles outwardly in direction towards the cylinder sidewalls. This \\n               \\n                 results in the potential to have a much larger value difference \\n               \\n                 between the minimum and the maximum damping force, as well \\n               \\n                 as a much larger value difference between the upstroke and the \\n               \\n                 down-stroke of the piston mechanism; and will provide a purely \\n               \\n                 mechanical basis for exerting very low-power electronic control, \\n               \\n                 which can be then optionally be added to the apparatus as a \\n               \\n                 whole. \\n               \\n                 For the case of active damping, sink-rate can be derived from a \\n               \\n                 no-moving parts system of dittering types-including, but not \\n               \\n                 limited, to a microphone-like sensor on the piston or a laser- \\n               \\n                 ranging unit of a laser frequency to which silicone fluid and air- \\n               \\n                 bubbles are transparent, and lie internal to the strut that \\n               \\n                 measures the speed of the piston relative to an end of the \\n               \\n                 cylinder. This type of system arrangement allows for continuous \\n               \\n                 granular (of time and space resolution comprising very small \\n               \\n                 increments such as nanoseconds and thousandths of an inch) \\n               \\n                 control of damping-force and the selection of damping-force \\n               \\n                 frequencies to fit the moment-by-moment upstroke velocities \\n               \\n                 and frequencies; will provide control signals to the active \\n               \\n                 damping system where the signal&#39;s amplitude is determined by \\n               \\n                 speed of motion and not by distance; and, in order that the \\n               \\n                 amplitude and frequencies are synchronous with the up-strokes \\n               \\n                 or down-strokes, thereby delivers appropriate frequencies and \\n               \\n                 amplitudes of damping synchronously with the event being \\n               \\n                 damped (either passively or actively ) via amplification \\n               \\n                 modalities, including but not limited to audio-type amplification \\n               \\n                 chips and circuits. \\n               \\n                 In one desirable embodiment, the actively controlled ITTEM \\n               \\n                 apparatus determines rate and position of the piston head \\n               \\n                 (relative to the end wall of the cylinder) by means including, but \\n               \\n                 not limited to, acoustic range-finding and/or acoustic doppler \\n               \\n                 frequency shift. This doppler method uses a continuously \\n               \\n                 rhythmically-varying complex frequency so that both time-delay \\n               \\n                 for distance and frequency-shift for speed are found \\n               \\n                 simultaneously using one emitter and one receiver. \\n               \\n                 For the optional ride-height adjustment (using one or more \\n               \\n                 methods including, but not limited to, changing the volume of \\n               \\n                 fluid in use and/or the fluid&#39;s distribution within the unit), the \\n               \\n                 capabilities added to the vehicle may be chosen from: The ability \\n               \\n                 to establish an upward velocity potentially exceeding that \\n               \\n                 required to break contact between wheels and the ground; and \\n               \\n                 the ability to provide a varying ride-height on all or some of the \\n               \\n                 vehicle&#39;s wheels, for purposes of ride-height and the tilt of the \\n               \\n                 vehicle (with respect to a specified inertial point of reference). \\n               \\n                 The mechanism for that tilting optionally includes features \\n               \\n                 including, but not limited to, regenerative tilt management; \\n               \\n                 thereby allowing vehicles with four or more wheels to tilt into \\n               \\n                 corners in the manner of a two-wheel motorcycle; and optionally \\n               \\n                 stiffening the damping-force of the extrinsically located controls \\n               \\n                 without consuming excessive energy. \\n               \\n                 Another embodiment able to provide ride-height adjustment for \\n               \\n                 a vehicle is the preemptive raising of a vehicle to prepare for \\n               \\n                 mass changes or kinetic events, such as receiving a load of rock \\n               \\n                 or launching missiles and for gently allowing that vehicle to sink \\n               \\n                 to its normal ride-height during the kinetic energy event in \\n               \\n                 question, instead of bottoming out. \\n               \\n                 Still another mode of control utilizes the flow speed of the hydraulic \\n               \\n                 fluid. Often, the speed of the silicone-based oil in the peripheral \\n               \\n                 orifice [owing to the 1 to 1000 ratio between the peripheral orifice \\n               \\n                 cross-sectional area and the cylinder cross-sectional area at a sink \\n               \\n                 rate of 30 feet per second] is 30000 feet per second or mach 6.8 \\n               \\n                 (sound travels 4,429 fps in silicone-based oil; and thus even a sink \\n               \\n                 rate of 4.5 fps produces peripheral valve flow-rates that are still \\n               \\n                 transonic). The mach cone shock wave generated by the piston \\n               \\n                 compression force not only contributes to damping in those regimes; \\n               \\n                 it also prevents contact between the piston and the cylinder.

Expected Uses and Intended Applications for the ITTEM Apparatus \\n     1. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the ITTEM is adapted for uses in which side loadings or bending forces are encountered\u2014e.g., MacPherson struts. \\n     Under these operational conditions, a load-bearing element having a plurality of peripheral ports alternated with load-bearing segments is employed in association with the piston head; or, alternatively, the fluid flow can be primarily in an external channel connecting the end points of the cylinder, at or beyond the maximum travel points of the piston. \\n     However, for a McPherson-Strut application, the side-load would be better done with bushings having large flow ports, such bushings being independent of the annular gap. \\n     2. The ITTEM apparatus is particular suited and adapted for use in aviation or for other applications involving those entities commonly known as oleo struts. For these embodiments, a separate gas pressurization canister is concentrically disposed about and reciprocally engaged with the rebound end of the cylinder in the ITTEM apparatus. \\n     Those skilled in the art will appreciate and understand that the ITTEM apparatus intended for aircraft use or oleo strut applications presents structural improvements, progressive compression, and rebound valving; and also eliminates fluid contamination and leakage. In these embodiments, there are no piston seals or other wear parts crucial to compression dampening. \\n     3. Other expected uses of and intended applications for the ITTEM apparatus include, but are not limited to: \\n     (a) Damping for seat mounts in MRAP type vehicles, particularly suited to embodiments such as 3-axis-of-freedom seat mounts using progressive coil-springs to create preload at the zero point; \\n     (b) Truck body isolation dampers; \\n     (c) Hydraulically regenerative vehicle-leveling and CG-management systems; \\n     (d) Embodiments with integrated springs added to inertial reel seat-belt lock systems and which allow impact attenuation; \\n     (e) Earthquake dampers for buildings; and \\n     (f) Deck and equipment silent mountings in submarines. \\n     The present invention is not limited in form nor restricted in scope except by the claims appended hereto:', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

No. 61/574,163. The legal priority and benefits of this first filing are expressly claimed herein.</p>\\n    \\n    \\n    <heading id=\"h-0002\">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">The present invention relates generally to a shock absorber, damping, and rebounding apparatus for managing contact impact forces as well as the transfer, thermal conversion, and dissipation of kinetic energy between interacting systems, such as the sprung weight or position of a vehicle and the unsprung weight or posture of a vehicle. Particularly, the present invention relates to and is directed toward marked improvements of the management of that kinetic energy using a hydraulic shock absorber apparatus of the type employing a fluid filled rigid or flexible cylinder and means for forcing the fluid reciprocally through a valving system with a piston arrangement.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0004\">Hydraulic Shock Absorbers</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Conventional piston-type hydraulic shock absorbers typically comprise a fluid-filled cylinder and piston arrangement; and include a piston head attached to an input shaft, whereby the input forces are axially applied to the shaft and initiate reciprocal movement of the piston head within the internal bore volume of the cylinder. In action, reciprocation of the piston head displaces a quantity of hydraulic fluid (typically a petroleum based oil) through an orifice, a controlling port, or a metering valve\u2014whereby the input kinetic energy is dissipated by displacement of the hydraulic fluid through the orifice, port or valve. The travel velocity of the reciprocating piston head, and thus the quantity of kinetic energy dissipated, is controlled by carefully metering the flow speed of the displaced hydraulic fluid to proceed at a prechosen rate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">Many arrangements for achieving an orifice variable with piston head position have been developed; and it is frequently desirable to provide some means of for varying the orifice restriction with the position of the piston head along its stroke. By use of such means, the resistance to hydraulic fluid motion can be made dependent upon and become tailored functions of specified parameter values such as rates of fluid velocity and the position of the piston head within the cylinder bore volume.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">A variety of hydraulic fluid flow arrangements which vary with piston position have been developed; and among these, many of the conventionally known hydraulic shock absorbers employ piston arrangements which force a low viscosity, petroleum-based oil or similar liquid through small openings or valves under very high pressure. Such devices may include a circular orifice in the piston through which passes a tapered rod attached to the cylinder wall; these often have varied depth grooves in the side wall of the cylinder and use tapered cylinders in which a fixed diameter piston and spring-loaded valves operate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">A common problem in these conventionally known mechanisms is the inability to arrest or resist rectilinear motion of mechanical parts; and a typical solution has been to employ a piston-cylinder assembly having a restricted passage for hydraulic fluid lowing from one side of the piston head to the other. Other shock absorbing assemblies incorporate grooves or furrows of varying depth into the material substance of the cylinder walls (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 695,775); or use tapered cylinders in which a fixed diameter piston operates (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,062,331); or dispose one or more complex valves into the passageway (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,113,072).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Also, as merely one vivid additional example of such a solution arrangement, U.S. Pat. No. 4,048,905 discloses a piston cylinder hydraulic snubbing device which employs the gap between ends of a piston ring as a valve orifice. This valve orifice, or piston ring gap, is varied by engagement of the ring with a tapered bore in the cylinder. Thus, on a jounce stroke, the piston ring is compressed against the tapered sidewall of the cylinder and closes the ring gap, thereby increasing piston stroke resistance. On the rebound stroke, the piston ring expands against the tapered sidewall of the cylinder, thereby opening the ring gap and reducing hydraulic resistance to the rebound stroke.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Another routine and commonplace problem encountered by conventional hydraulic shock absorbers involves the over-heating, foaming, and cavitation of the petroleum oil (or other liquid) used as hydraulic fluid. It has long been recognized that the heat created by conventional shock absorbers is largely generated either at the orifice, port or valve adjacent the piston or at one end of the cylinder; and such heat accumulates and becomes centered in the hydraulic fluid. In operative terms, this means that the quantitative bulk of the hydraulic fluid must initially absorb the heat energy and itself consequently rise in temperature before the flowing fluid can carry the heat energy to the cylinder walls for subsequent transfer and dissipation. Thus, over time and expected duration of use, the hydraulic fluid continuously suffers from repetitious heating effects and frequently severely degrades over time from over-heating, foaming, and cavitation in-situ.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">A commonly employed solution for this heat problem is to pressurize the hydraulic fluid chamber with a coolant such as gaseous nitrogen in order to control internal vapor pressures, reduce hydraulic fluid foaming and fade, and thereby Improve performance. More recent attempts to improve shock absorber performance have also led to the use of electronic or computer controlled valving in order to provide an acceptable level of performance over a wider range of operational conditions. However, by employing such extrinsic active valve controls, the time-lag occurring between the heat sensing event and the act of actual damping prevents real time synchronicity. As a result, both the reliability and the manufacturing cost of the typical shock absorber apparatus have now become very significant factors in the design of an adequate damper and/or suspension system for a vehicle.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0005\">Dampers and Damping Systems</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">Dampers are specific devices and constructions which act and are characterized by their ability to convert kinetic energy to heat energy. Such devices are typically used in wheeled vehicles and with different kinds of aircraft to absorb kinetic energy resulting from contact impact shocks and terrain caused vibrations. Merely exemplifying and representing the range and variety of conventionally known damper devices and damping systems are those disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,743,362; 5,347,771; 5,076,403; and 5,036,633 respectively.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">In one exemplary type of damper, the kinetic energy causes a piston to move through a cylinder containing viscous fluid. An orifice is provided such that the hydraulic fluid can flow around the moving piston to absorb the kinetic energy and then to convert the kinetic energy resulting from contact impact shocks and terrain caused vibrations into heat energy. However, it has been long recognized that changes in operating temperature can greatly alter the viscosity of the hydraulic fluid such that, at ever-higher operating temperatures, the fluid becomes ever-less viscous, and the energy converted by the damper markedly decreases. Consequently, the long recognized variations in damper performance owing to large changes in operating temperature makes the use of such conventional damping devices and systems unreliable, and often unacceptable, in many instances and desired applications.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">Accordingly, a substantial and long recognized need remains today for an improved shock absorber and damper apparatus which will function reliably over a wide range of operating temperatures; and also avoid, or markedly reduce, or meaningfully eliminate the many defects now routinely present in conventionally available shock absorbing and damping systems. In particular, a substantial need still exists for a shock absorber apparatus which lacks the propensity to foaming of its fluid and other thermally-related degradations of performance, as well as having close time-wise synchronicity between sensing the kinetic event to be damped and applying appropriate damping.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0006\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p

<p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0055\">The present invention is a networkable, peripherally valved hydraulic shock absorber and damper apparatus which is a substantial improvement and major advance over the shock absorber and damping systems conventionally known to date. The apparatus employs an elevated viscosity non-petroleum fluid as a damping medium; and presents a unique structural construction that utilizes peripheral valving to shunt a high viscosity hydraulic fluid between the peripheral edge of the piston head and the cylinder wall.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0056\">In particular, the invention is an Inertial Terrain Transit Event Manager (or \u201cITTEM\u201d)\u2014an apparatus suitable for absorbing, attenuating, adapting, preventing, and diffusing deflections and other kinetic energy events; and in which the wheels or treads, suspension system, or supporting undercarriage of a vehicle or aircraft transfer Impact shock tortes and oscillation energy to the body of the vehicle or aircraft then engaged in the process of contacting a solid surface or crossing terrain. As such, the ITTEM is a shock absorber and damper apparatus of the general type having a hydraulic cylinder and reciprocating piston; is an apparatus suitable for managing initial impact shocks as well as controlling rebound effects; and can effectively control ride-height when combined with an incorporated or associated spring capability (metal springs and/or compressed gas), as well as manage ride-height (either passively with spring capability or actively with ride-height control decoupled from that spring capability).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0057\">As is described in greater detail hereinafter, the cylinder of the ITTEM apparatus contains a reciprocating piston mechanism and a discrete compartment whose volume is desirably filled with a silicone-based hydraulic fluid of elevated viscosity, this viscous hydraulic fluid having only slight compressibility under pressure and preferably exhibiting a pseudo-plastic flow when pressurized. As a result, with the occurrence of impact shock forces and oscillation energy, a displacement and upward-stroke movement of a piston head is initiated within the internal bore volume of the cylinder; which in turn creates an intense compression force and hydraulic pressure upon the viscous hydraulic fluid contained therein; and also generates an increasing kinetic energy in and fluid flow for the viscous hydraulic fluid, which takes the form of fluidic bow-waves and/or ultrasonic shock waves.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0058\">Thus, when moving through the internal bore volume of the cylinder, these flowing fluid waves will first encounter a deformable flow baffle or other structural form of intrinsic damping-force control means; and then are directed in flow direction to enter an open channel pathway of an thermally expandable annular gap, which is located adjacently between the piston head and the sidewalls of the cylinder. This thermally expandable annular gap not only controls and directs the wave flow path of the viscous hydraulic fluid, but also serves as a temperature expanding peripheral valve.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0059\">Ire function and overall effect therefore, the open channel of the thermally expandable annular gap acts as a peripheral control gateway and release portal of temperature variable size for the ingress and egress of moving viscous fluid waves generated by fluid resistance to piston head displacement within the bore volume of the cylinder; and in combination with the deformable flow baffle or other chosen structural format (passive, or active, or both of these), will provide greatly enhanced shock absorbing capabilities and effective damping for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0060\">In this manner, the organization of the ITTEM apparatus utilizes peripheral valving to shunt hydraulic fluid between the peripheral edge of the piston head and each of the cylinder sidewalls (or in the alternative, the periphery of a nested piston and the flow-channel adjacently located by it); and manages and directs that flowing fluid into an open channel pathway lying between the piston periphery and the cylinder\u2014all without the use of any additional components.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0061\">Notably also, the ITTEM apparatus performs the function of damping control via different modes of damping, which include: velocity-gradient-based damping, laminar-flow-damping, turbulent-flow-damping, damping in subsonic-through-Machian flow regimes; as well as the multiple transitional-flow instances occurring between these via unique hydrodynamic configuration.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0009\">Major Advantages and Notable Benefits of the ITTEM Apparatus</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0062\">Among the marked advantages and many desirable benefits of the ITTEM apparatus are the following:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0063\">1. The ITTEM apparatus uses and takes advantage of currently available real-time electronic control systems; and has the capability to control non-linear aspects of transient fluid flow dynamics; and provides the ability to reduce the time-lag between the sensing of an impact force and effective damping action. These multiple capabilities represent clear differences and major distinctions over conventional hydraulic shock absorber systems.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0064\">2. Via the use of thermal expansion means to manage changes in hydraulic fluid viscosity caused by environmental or operational heating, the ITTEM apparatus provides a variable, but always controlled, damping-force response which responds to and can be based on the rate of an externally applied impact force and the rate of impact force change over time for that external impact force.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0065\">3. In the unique ITTEM apparatus comprising the present invention, the shape and other topographical details of the piston head, as well as the chosen structural form of the intrinsic damping-force control means, can be employed to markedly alter the mode and manner of resistance to hydraulic fluid flow around the piston; as well as to initiate and affect resistance changes as a factor and function of the compressed fluid&#39;s acceleration, velocity and viscosity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0066\">4. The ITTEM apparatus allows the use of either passive and/or active structural implementations as discrete intrinsic damping-force control means. The available range of choices provides a nearly limitless degree of variance for the application of damping-force control with respect to the velocity, acceleration, and stroke length of the piston mechanism and flowing viscous hydraulic fluid being damped.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0067\">5. Via the instant ITTEM apparatus, the use of low-cost and robust electronic control systems and the sensors associated with them [and/or advanced fluid-logic implementations] are available as extrinsically activated and applied damping-force control means; and the resulting damping affects effects achieved in-situ are both dynamic and reflective of real world use circumstances.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0068\">Thus, the dynamic range of hydraulic fluid resistance and kinetic energy exchanges can be predicted in advance of use; and the damping system construction made dependent on any combination of fluid flow rate relative to the piston or displacement of fluid, or frequency of damper reciprocation\u2014as needed for or appropriate to the many different foreseeable applications and intended modes of operation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0069\">6. The ITTEM apparatus can completely manage the interface existing between many different kinds of mechanical and electrical systems conventionally used today and their ambient environment for a wide range of vehicles and aircraft. The present invention can be advantageously employed with many different wheeled vehicles and aircraft on the ground, and the terrain they cross</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0070\">Thus, the expected variety of applications today includes, but is not limited to: wheeled vehicles, such as automobiles, buses, and trucks; treaded vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks; tracked vehicles such as trolley cars, railroad cars, railed tankers, locomotives and electric trams; and aircraft such as helicopters and winged airplanes capable of landing on a ship&#39;s deck, or on a landing pad, or upon the ground; as well as being able to travel over and cross the existing terrain.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0071\">7. The ITTEM apparatus provides continuous granular control\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014to vary adaptively the strength and duration of available damping-force and rebound; and is sufficient to fit the moment-by-moment and millimeter-by-millimeter upstroke and down-stroke velocities and frequencies. Moreover, in order that the amplitude and frequencies of damping be synchronous to the greatest extent possible with the up-stroke or down-stroke of the piston mechanism, these structural controls will deliver the appropriate frequencies and amplitudes of damping synchronously with the impact events being damped\u2014either passively with hydro-mechanical implementation, or via amplification modalities including but not limited to audio-type amplification chips and circuits.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0072\">8. The range of alternative embodiments available for use as the ITTEM apparatus allow for a more granular effect\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014for damping of terrain-crossing kinetic events, compared with conventionally known devices and systems. In the present invention, the trace of oscillations between the sprung and unsprung weight of a vehicle is nearly or completely synchronous with the trace of damping-force; and the peaks of relative speed-of-motion between the unsprung weight/posture and the sprung weight/position of the vehicle are synchronous (or nearly so) with the peaks of damping-force applied, acid exactly (or closely) coincide in relative amplitude with the peaks of damping-force applied</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0073\">9. In constructing the ITTEM apparatus, the availability today of low-cost, robust electronic control systems and the sensors associated with them, as well as the use of advanced fluid-logic implementations, allows dynamic and predictive behaviors of damping systems to be implemented. The resistance of the apparatus to the expected impact force changes can be made to be dependent upon any combination of rate, displacement or frequency of impact forces as appropriate to different applications and modes of use.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0010\">I. Specific Embodiments of the ITTEM Apparatus</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0074\">A wide and diverse range of embodiments comprising the ITTEM apparatus can be constructed. Merely representative and illustrative of the available construct alternatives are the two particular examples provided below. It is expressly understood, however, that the two embodiments presented in detail herein are neither limiting nor restrictive of the many other constructions and formats that are available to meet the particular conditions or individual needs of the intended user.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0075\">As presented in great detail below, both an operative minimalist format and a far more sophisticated and complex non-minimalist format are described in sequence\u2014in order that the essential structural component parts of the invention be easily recognized and quickly distinguished from the more desirable optional structural features and additions present in the preferred constructions. As such, the two described and illustrated embodiments represent structural alternatives revealing and demonstrating the true scope and breadth of the invention.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0011\">A. An Operative Minimalist Structural Format</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0076\"> <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simple construct and minimalist embodiment of the ITTEM invention. As seen therein, the shock absorbing and damping apparatus <b>100</b> is of the cylinder and piston type.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0077\">The apparatus <b>100</b> as whole comprises an elongated and hollow cylinder which appears in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> as a single housing <b>110</b> having an upper end wall <b>111</b> with one open end <b>106</b>, a closed lower end wall <b>112</b>, two discrete solid sidewalls <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>, and an extended internal bore volume <b>120</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0078\">A pressure-resistant compartment barrier <b>140</b> is transversely positioned along the axis AA\u2032 between the sidewalls <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>; and this pressure-resistant barrier <b>140</b> divides the extended internal bore volume <b>120</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b> into two adjacently located separated compartments constituting a discrete gas-containing spatial region <b>160</b> and a discrete hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>170</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0079\">As shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the pressure resistant compartment barrier <b>140</b> is a single structural entity; provides a pressure-tight fitting for the boundary of the gas-containing region <b>160</b>; and also presents a resilient fluid-tight surface at the boundary of the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>170</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0080\">For this purpose, the pressure resistant compartment barrier <b>140</b> interface lying between the fluid-containing region <b>170</b> and the gas-containing region <b>160</b> is composed of a durable and flexible, non porous material exemplified by, but not limited to, substances such as rubber, synthetic rubber, silicone elastomers, teflon, flexible metal bellows, etc. Each of these suitable materials is either slideable as an inherent attribute; or can be made in the form of a rolling boot, such as those used in conventional air-inflated ride-height-adjustable shock absorbers.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0081\">The apparatus <b>100</b> also comprises a reciprocating piston mechanism <b>130</b> which is disposed and moveable throughout the extended internal bore volume <b>120</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b>. The piston mechanism <b>130</b> includes a displaceable piston head <b>132</b>; a fixed piston rod (or support shaft) <b>134</b> which passes through the gas-containing region <b>160</b>, and the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>170</b>; and a distal end <b>136</b> of the piston rod <b>134</b> which passes through the open end <b>106</b> in the upper wall <b>111</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0082\">It will be recognized also that this minimalist piston mechanism <b>130</b> is depicted in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> as a one-part piston head; which is formed of solid matter; has only smooth exterior surfaces grid faces; and does not present or include any primary orifices or valves as such.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0083\">Nevertheless, in non-minimalist embodiments, it will be clearly understood that the piston head can alternatively be comprised of multiple segments; can optionally present one or more surface faces and features which topographically are neither smooth nor regular; and can also optionally have a variety of open grooves or furrows over its exterior surfaces.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0084\">Also as shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the displaceable piston head <b>132</b> is located within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>170</b>; and the piston rod <b>134</b> is capable of up-strokes and down-strokes repeatedly over the length of the extended internal bore volume <b>120</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b>, and will thereby initiate movement and displacement of the piston head <b>132</b> on-demand.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0085\">Disposed within the open end <b>106</b> of the upper wall <b>111</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b> is a thermally expandable seal <b>180</b> through which the distal end <b>136</b> of the piston rod <b>134</b> travels. The expandable seal <b>180</b> maintains the integrity of the internal bore volume <b>120</b> as the distal end <b>136</b> of the piston rod <b>134</b> travels through the open end <b>106</b> in the upper wall <b>111</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0086\">In addition, a gas portal <b>115</b> is disposed within the traveling distal end <b>136</b> of the piston rod <b>134</b>; and this gas portal <b>115</b> is suitable for introducing pressurized gas into the spatial volume of the gas-containing region <b>260</b>. Not shown within <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> is a gas valve and a source of pressurized gas which can be connected to the gas portal <b>115</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0087\">Via the gas portal <b>115</b>, the gas-containing spatial region <b>160</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b> is filled with a suitable compressible gas such as nitrogen. Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas\u2014which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke (such as a full extension) to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region <b>160</b> serves as an effective pressure reference; and, optionally, also serves as the rebounding medium for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0088\">In this manner, the compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke direction and position) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of the cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means. In addition to its primary purpose and function, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region can also serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0089\">In contrast, the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>170</b> of the invention is filled with a viscous oil (or other highly viscous liquid)\u2014such as a high-viscous silicon-based oil having semi-plastic fluid flow characteristics. The viscous hydraulic fluid is resistant to compression force; and is capable of motion within the compartment volume of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder when compression force and kinetic energy is imparted to the viscous hydraulic fluid (via the displacement of the piston head <b>132</b> within the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>170</b>).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0090\">Joined to and surrounding the surface of the piston rod <b>134</b> at a location adjacent to the piston head <b>132</b> is a single, substantially disc-shaped and flat surface, passive-resistance flow baffle <b>150</b>, which is one preferred passive example of the intrinsic damping-force control means employed in the present invention. As seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the passive-resistance flow baffle <b>150</b> is a structural entity integrally joined to the piston rod <b>134</b>; is composed of resilient matter of a kind which will physically deform in response to the directional displacement of the piston head and the resistance offered by the wave motions of the viscous oil (or other liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; thereby either increase or decrease the quantum of hydraulic fluid resistance against the moving piston head as it travels within the bore volume of the cylinder housing\u2014the quantum and manner of resistance in question being imparted to the moving hydraulic fluid by particular direction of travel for the moving piston head within the longitudinal bore volume of the cylinder housing. In essence, therefore, the flow baffle <b>150</b> seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> will control how much damping force is applied as the viscous hydraulic fluid is pushed past it during the up-strokes and down-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism <b>130</b> within the internal bore volume <b>120</b> of the cylinder housing <b>110</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0091\">The disc-shaped resistance flow baffle <b>150</b> can be fashioned from a wide variety of suitable resilient materials and thermally expanding chemical formulations. In particular, the substantive material from which the resistance flow baffle <b>150</b> is made often will have specified coefficients of thermal expansion that are chosen in advance of apparatus construction; and exhibit specific coefficient of thermal expansion that matches, or is chosen to be greater than, or sometimes is less than the particular coefficient of thermal expansion of the material(s) constituting the cylinder housing <b>110</b>. The availability and desired choice of such a specific and chosen in-advance coefficient of thermal expansion for the passive-resistance flow baffle <b>150</b> allows the apparatus <b>100</b> as a whole to respond differently and alternatively to a wide range of varying operating temperatures with about the same (more or less) quantum of damping force.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0092\">In addition, although a flat surfaced disc shape is deemed to be generally operative and useful as the chosen flow baffle design, it is emphatically noted here that the pre-chosen configuration for the flow baffle <b>150</b> need not necessarily be either flat surfaced or disc-shaped as such. To the contrary, the overall shape and dimensions of the passive-resistance flow baffle may be varied greatly to meet the particular needs or expected conditions of use; and each chosen variant of a resistance flow baffle shape will offer individual considerations and provide a range of substantially different flow resistance features and thermal expansion characteristics.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0093\">Lastly, the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises an annular gap <b>190</b> of temperature variable size which exists as an open channel pathway between the flow baffle <b>150</b> (the passive-resistance, intrinsic damping-force control means) and each cylinder sidewall <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> present within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>170</b>. The annular gap <b>190</b> serves as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve; and causes temperature-differing flow rates for the moving viscous hydraulic fluid as it passes through the open channel pathway.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0080\" num=\"0094\">As shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, the annular gap <b>190</b> exists between the periphery of the flow baffle <b>150</b> and the cylinder sidewalls <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. This annular gap functions as the peripheral valve for travel of the fluid around the piston head. Under increasing ambient or internally generated temperatures, the flow baffle <b>150</b> expands in size and into closer engagement with the cylinder wall, thereby narrowing the overall size of the annular gap <b>190</b> between the expanded flow baffle and the cylinder sidewalls.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0081\" num=\"0095\">In contrast, lower ambient temperatures will cause this annular gap size to increase. Thus in these lower temperature instances, the peripheral valve resistance remains constant, regardless of fluid viscosity changes due to ambient or internally generated temperatures.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0082\" num=\"0096\">Note also that damping performance is maintained via this structural arrangement, even under conditions of extreme cold or heat. Internally generated heat is created at that area of the ITTEM apparatus where ambient cooling is most available; and the peripheral valve gap, bounded on one side by the piston head and on the other side by the inner surface face of the cylinder sidewalls, allows the piston assembly to \u201csqueegee\u201d the heat up and down the cylinder wall surfaces for dissipation into the environment. This arrangement also positively manages and effectively controls the applied damping-forces quickly, in real-time requirements and durations.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0012\">B. A More Sophisticated &amp; Preferred Embodiment</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0083\" num=\"0097\">A far more structurally elaborate and preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>. This preferred embodiment offers substantial rebound capability, as well as effective temperature compensation management features.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0084\" num=\"0098\">As seen therein, the shock absorbing and damping apparatus <b>200</b> is presented which is also of the cylinder and piston type\u2014but is a construct which is markedly different in structure from the minimalist format described above.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0085\" num=\"0099\">As shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, the preferred shock absorbing and damping apparatus <b>200</b> comprises an elongated and hollow unified cylinder casing <b>210</b> which presents an elongated central bore volume <b>220</b>. However, the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b> is itself a construct of two slidable parts formed by an outer cylinder envelope <b>209</b> which surrounds a portion of and is fitted tightly over a sliding inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b>, comprising a telescoping assembly.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0086\" num=\"0100\">Notably, the outer cylinder envelope <b>209</b> includes an upper wall <b>211</b> with an open end <b>206</b> and two discrete solid outer sidewalls <b>213</b> and <b>215</b>; while the inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b> includes a closed lower wall <b>212</b> and two discrete solid inner sidewalls <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. In addition, it will be recognized and appreciated that the outer cylinder envelope <b>209</b> typically has straight linear sidewalls <b>213</b> and <b>215</b>, while the sidewalls <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> and concomitant inner diameter of the inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b> alternatively can be either straight/linear or of varied diameter.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0087\" num=\"0101\">The unified construction of the cylinder casing <b>210</b> also provides a generally elongated central bore volume <b>220</b> which is divided along the axis BB\u2032 via a pressure resistant barrier <b>240</b> into a discrete gas-containing region <b>260</b> and a discrete hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b>. Furthermore, because the outer cylinder envelope <b>209</b> presents only straight/linear sidewalls <b>213</b> and <b>215</b>, the spatial volume of the gas-containing region <b>260</b> will generally be cylindrical in configuration. However, because the sidewalls <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> of the inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b> alternatively can be either straight or inclined over their linear length or any segment thereof, the spatial cavity of the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b> will often be varied in diameter size and overall configuration; and can appear as a tapering and/or cone-shaped volume, or as a non-inclining and generally cylindrically-shaped cavity space, or as a cylindrically-shaped space composed of both tapering and non-inclining segments.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0088\" num=\"0102\">The preferred apparatus <b>200</b> also comprises a reciprocating piston mechanism <b>230</b> which is disposed and moveable over the linear length of the central bore volume <b>220</b> of the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b>. The piston mechanism <b>230</b> includes a multipart piston head core <b>232</b>; and a fixed piston rod (or support rod) <b>234</b> whose linear length passes through both the gas-containing region <b>260</b> and the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b>, and whose shaft distal end <b>236</b> extends through the opening <b>206</b> in the upper end wall <b>211</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0089\" num=\"0103\">Disposed within the open end <b>206</b> of the upper end wall <b>211</b> of the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b> is a thermally expandable seal <b>280</b> through which the distal end <b>236</b> of the piston rod <b>234</b> travels. The expandable annular seal <b>280</b> maintains the integrity of the internal bore volume <b>220</b> as the distal end <b>236</b> of the piston rod <b>234</b> travels through the open end <b>206</b> in the upper wall <b>211</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0090\" num=\"0104\">In addition, a gas portal <b>218</b> is disposed within the traveling end <b>236</b> of the piston rod <b>234</b>; and this gas portal <b>218</b> is suitable for introducing pressurized gas into the spatial volume of the gas-containing region <b>260</b>. Not shown within <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> is a gas valve and a source of pressurized gas which can be connected to the gas portal <b>218</b>. As an alternative, the gas portal can utilize and be attached to any form of intrinsically or extrinsically controlled gas pressure valving by which to control and adjust the pressure within the gas-containing region <b>260</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0091\" num=\"0105\">The reciprocating piston mechanism <b>230</b> is capable of performing up-strokes and down-strokes repeatedly within said internal bore volume <b>210</b> of the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b>; and the fixed piston rod (or support rod) <b>234</b> serves as target point of an impact contact sufficient for initiating shaft movement and concomitant displacement of the multipart piston head core <b>232</b> within the internal bore volume <b>220</b> of the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0092\" num=\"0106\">As shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, a multipart piston head core <b>232</b> lies attached to the piston rod <b>234</b>; and this multipart piston head core is typically comprised of a single core plate <b>237</b> joined to two or more kinds of disk-shaped members which appear as a series of individual piston head segments <b>238</b> and one or more piston head caps <b>239</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0093\" num=\"0107\">In essence, the core plate <b>237</b> is a single disc-shaped plank upon which a series of piston head segments <b>238</b> <i>a</i>-<b>238</b> <i>d </i>are individually joined at one surface face; and upon which one of inure styles of piston head caps <b>239</b> lie attached on the reverse surface face. The core plate <b>237</b> as such is illustrated by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>; the series of individual piston head segments <b>238</b> <i>a</i>-<b>238</b> <i>d </i>are shown in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>; and the range of styled piston head caps <b>239</b> <i>a </i>and <b>239</b> <i>b </i>are illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0094\" num=\"0108\">As regards the configuration of the individual piston caps <b>239</b> <i>a </i>and <b>239</b> <i>b </i>mounted upon one surface of the core plate <b>237</b>, these caps can be fashioned into a variety of different shapes which will alternatively: (i) Change the totality of the available damping force; and/or (ii) the direction of damping force; and/or (iii) the rate of damping force then being applied; and/or (iv) the rate of change when altering the presently applied damping force.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0095\" num=\"0109\">It is also recognized that it may often be more advantageous to have the rate of damping force for a shock absorbing system be markedly different for the compression stroke and extension stroke directions of the reciprocating piston mechanism. To achieve this purpose and result, a simple concave-shaped multipart piston head would provide maximum resistance for the compression stroke. In contrast however, a multipart truncated conical piston head would provide a much lower resistance and damping force rate for the compression stroke.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0110\">Moreover, the rate of damping force can be meaningfully modified and altered via a multipart piston head core shaped as a truncated cone with concentric groves around it. This particular structural format for the piston head core will create predictable drag in response to any specific fluid flow rate for the moving viscous hydraulic fluid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0111\">In addition, many kinds of surface changes and face finish adaptations to the overall topography of the exterior surface for the assembled multipart piston head core may be optionally used either to increase or to decrease fluid resistance at various hydraulic fluid velocity ranges. Thus, a simple hemispherical piston head surface is often advantageous; as is a toroidally-grooved exposed surface for the assembled piston head core. Moreover, many other alternative shapes for the topography of the exterior surface are also available by which to adjust the fluid dray in order to meet and satisfy various conditions of hydraulic fluid viscosity and fluid flow rate.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0098\" num=\"0112\">Accordingly, via the gas portal <b>218</b>, the gas-containing region <b>260</b> of the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b> is filled to a desired internal pressure with a compressible gas such as nitrogen. Once filled with gas to a predetermined internal pressure, the gas-containing region <b>260</b> and its compressible gas serve as an effective shock absorbing compartment for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0099\" num=\"0113\">Attention is again emphatically directed to the particular functions provided by the gas-containing region <b>260</b>. Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas-which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region serves as a positional reference-pressure source, as an effective pressure source by which to counteract in part the shock effect caused by the impact contact forces; and, optionally, also serves as the immediate rebounding means for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0100\" num=\"0114\">For these purposes, the compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke position and direction) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means located elsewhere within the apparatus. In addition, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region optionally can serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0101\" num=\"0115\">In contrast, the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b> of the invention is filled with a high viscous oil (or other suitable hydraulic liquid) such as a high-viscous silicon-based oil having semi-plastic fluid flow characteristics. Then, when the impact shock event occurs, the displaced piston head core compresses the viscous fluid; causes fluidic wave motion and fluid flow within the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b>; and the kinetic energy carried by the moving waves of viscous oil is initially resisted and controlled, and subsequently is damped and converted into heat energy.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0102\" num=\"0116\">In order to maintain the integrity of the two individual regions <b>260</b> and <b>270</b> constituting the extended central bore volume <b>220</b>, a pressure resistant disc-shaped barrier <b>240</b> is employed to separate them. The pressure resistant disc-shaped barrier <b>240</b> is formed in-part as and appears within the gas-containing region <b>260</b> by as a pressure-tight fitted cap <b>242</b>; and the separation barrier is also formed in-part as and exists within the hydraulic fluid-containing region <b>270</b> as a buffer layer <b>244</b>. Both the fitted cap <b>242</b> and the fluid-tight plate <b>244</b> are internally linked to each other to form a unitary physical barrier; and both are typically made of resilient, flexible and non porous material as described in text pertaining to <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, item <b>140</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0103\" num=\"0117\">In addition, another buffer layer <b>246</b> formed of highly-compressible resilient, flexible and non-porous material is optionally disposed adjacent to the closed lower wall <b>212</b> of the inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b>. In many instances, this optional buffer layer <b>246</b> may be formed and implemented as a hollow, inflatable-ring bladder of toroidal shape.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0104\" num=\"0118\">It will be appreciated that the apparatus <b>200</b> can employ either or both passive damping-force control means and active damping-force control means as integrated components. Accordingly, joined to and surrounding a portion of the piston rod <b>234</b> at a location adjacent to the multipart piston head core <b>232</b> is a single, substantially dome-shaped flow baffle <b>250</b> constituting one embodiment of the passive-resistance flow control means. The dome shape of the passive-resistance flow baffle <b>250</b> seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> will control how much damping force is applied as the viscous hydraulic fluid is pushed past it during the up-strokes and down-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism <b>230</b> within the bore volume of the inner cylinder chamber <b>208</b>. Although only a single flow baffle appears in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be understood that two or more individual flow baffles may be employed simultaneously at any time.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0105\" num=\"0119\">The passive-resistance flow baffle <b>250</b> will always be a structural entity located and integrally joined to that part of the piston shaft assembly <b>234</b> and <b>290</b> which is present within the compartment volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region <b>270</b>; will be composed of resilient matter of a chemical kind and formulation which will physically deform in response to the directional displacement of the piston head and the resistance offered during compression of the viscous oil (or other liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; and will cause either an increase or a decrease in the quantum of hydraulic fluid resistance offered against the compression stroke of the moving piston head core as it travels within the bore volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region <b>270</b>\u2014the quantum and manner of fluid resistance in question offered by the moving hydraulic fluid varying with the compression force of the moving piston head core within the longitudinal bore volume of the hydraulic-containing fluid region <b>270</b>. In essence, therefore, the effects of the flow baffle <b>250</b> seen in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> will dictate and control how much passive damping force is applied to the moving viscous hydraulic fluid which flows around and over it during the compression-strokes of the reciprocating piston mechanism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0106\" num=\"0120\">A wide variety of shapes for the passive-resistance flow baffle are expected and contemplated for use in order to adapt this invention for a wide range of different applications, and in order to control how much damping force is applied as the hydraulic fluid is forced past it. The flow baffle can be fashioned from many different suitable materials of known chemical formulation; and typically will have prechosen coefficients of thermal expansion that alternatively match that of the cylinder wall material, or are greater than that of the cylinder material, or are less than that of the cylinder wall material. These choices of coefficients of thermal expansion affect the capabilities of the flow baffle; and when properly selected, allow the apparatus <b>200</b> as a whole to respond to differences in operating temperature with the about the same (more or less) quantum of damping force.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0107\" num=\"0121\">In addition, the passive-resistance baffle optionally may have a fluted-like perimeter edge surface\u2014i.e., a margin and side-edge topographical feature which provides different amounts of flow resistance and will vary with the details of flow interaction along Its fluted edges. Other design choices can include: a baffle segment which provides a uniform expansion space with a smoother edge.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0122\">Alternatively, the flow baffle can be a segment having gear like teeth over its surfaces to provide particular flow characteristics at specified speeds of fluid flow; and optionally appear as a baffle set of two or more rotable disks having relief cuts on their perimeter edges such that each of the multiple discrete flow baffles in the set individually rotates at its own individual speed around the same piston rod in-situ.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0123\">This last optional design feature deserves further description owing to its ability to rotate on-demand. In every instance, flow baffle rotation must be controlled; and such control can be achieved in alternative modes and manners. Thus, one form of control may be accomplished intrinsically in the form of a threaded piston rod and spring loading of the shaft. Alternatively, rotation control can also be accomplished extrinsically by applying force directly to a concentric rotational portion of the supporting piston rod.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0110\" num=\"0124\">Each embodiment of the preferred apparatus <b>200</b> also presents and includes at least one annular gap <b>290</b> of temperature variable size/diameter-which exists as an open channel pathway between the flow baffle <b>250</b> (the passive damping-force control means) and each cylinder sidewall <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> defining the perimeter and compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region <b>270</b>. The annular gap <b>290</b> existing between the piston <b>290</b> and the cylinder wall <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> serves as a dynamically varying open channel pathway; will appear and function as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing, peripheral valve; and will allow size adjustments, including temperature-differing variations, of quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through in either direction during the up-stroke and/or down-stroke of the piston mechanism <b>230</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0111\" num=\"0125\">The apparatus <b>200</b> illustrated by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> also optionally includes (and employs in the more preferred structural formats) at least one form of extrinsically activated clamping-force control means positioned in part upon the exterior of or otherwise positioned remotely from the cylinder walls; and disposed in-part internally within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0112\" num=\"0126\">The extrinsically activated damping-force control means is in controlling communication with at least a portion of the piston mechanism, and is independently able to direct and to control the quantum of damping force then being applied to the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid within the hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0113\" num=\"0127\">In many instances, prechosen activation and communication means, such as an electronic control module, are positioned and affixed externally to and remote from the unified cylinder casing <b>210</b>. The externally affixed activation and communication means are independently able to direct and control the quantum of damping force then being applied to the kinetic energy of the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid. Nevertheless, if and when required or desired, the prechosen activation and communication means, such as an electronic control module can alternatively be disposed and positioned internally anywhere within the extended bore volume of the cylinder, so long as that location does not meaningfully interfere with the other component parts of the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0114\" num=\"0128\">A desirable system of activation and communication <b>300</b> having active damping-force control means employs the electronic control module <b>320</b> shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>. As seen therein, the electronic control module <b>320</b> has an attached storage unit <b>321</b> to keep instructions, to set data points, and to record actual use conditions for later analysis. Also, the control module <b>320</b> typically includes an internal clock mechanism so that rates of change over time may be measured.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0115\" num=\"0129\">As a desirable part of the extrinsically activated damping-force control means, a wide variety of measuring and recording sensors may be attached in order to gather data about performance and conditions. In the format shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, a position sensor <b>322</b> will report the extensions of compression of the strut element. Similarly, a pressure sensor <b>323</b> will report the gas pressure at the strut valve. Other sensors can direct input from a human operator and may be imputed into the system via an option port <b>324</b>. In addition, the gas pressure in the strut <b>326</b> may be regulated by means of a pressurization system valve <b>325</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0116\" num=\"0130\">A range of differing active damping adjustments may also be performed with internal elements of the strut <b>326</b>, such as movable baffle plates. For this purpose, there is desirably an optional additional output port for attaching future actuators and other output mechanism to the electronic control module. Taken together these elements and components form an active control network which effectively and dynamically manages the damping performance of the control system. Since rates of change and historical data are measured, the system <b>300</b> may employ historical data to improve future performance.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0013\">II. Other Structural Aspects of and Characteristic Features for the ITTEM Apparatus</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0117\" num=\"0131\">The minimalist and preferred embodiments set forth in detail above are merely two representative constructs illustrating the true scope and breadth of the present invention. A great many other structural variations can be individually introduced into the essential components of the ITTEM apparatus; and the present invention allows for a very wide range of alternative combinations and permutations of features in the construct&#39;s design. The range and variety of expected variations and optional modifications include all of those described subsequently herein.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0014\">A. The Cylinder &amp; its Internal Bore</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0118\" num=\"0132\">1. In accordance with alternative embodiments of the present invention, the elongated bore volume of the hydraulic cylinder housing may have a straight or tapered shape, depending upon the intended application. Thus, in some preferred embodiments, the spatial cavity of the hydraulic fluid-containing region will vary in diameter size and overall configuration; and will appear as a tapering and/or cone-shaped volume, or as a non-inclining and generally cylindrically-shaped cavity space, or as a cylindrically-shaped space composed of both tapering and non-inclining segments.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0119\" num=\"0133\">2. The material substance of the cylinder itself can be one or more of the conventionally known metals, ceramics, and/or alloy composites which are chemically non-reactive, malleable, pressure-resistant, and resilient. Moreover, any of the known surface finishes including, but not limited to etching, sand-blasting, machining, fluid-dynamic boundary-layer finishes such as microperforation, and velocity-gradient moderation finishing methods such as \u201cwetting control\u201d relative to the fluid in use, may be utilized for construction of the cylinder. In this manner, the cylinder itself contributes to the individual tailoring of the damping-force by the careful choice and application of one or more of any of the known surface finishes for the metals, ceramics, and/or composites used in construction of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0120\" num=\"0134\">3. A substantially non-absorbent, compressible fluid medium (of a type including but not limited to an inflatable-ring-bladder and/or a closed cell sponge neoprene ring) can be optionally positioned internally within the internal bore volume at one or at both end walls of the cylinder. This non-absorbent, compressible medium optionally may or may not be inflated and/or preloaded before or after full assembly of the apparatus as a whole; and when present, the non-absorbent, compressible medium positioned in the bore volume adjacent the end(s) of the cylinder will become compressed by the flowing viscous fluid (set into motion by the displaced piston head as it travels through the cylinder bore). Resistance to this flowing viscous fluid by the piston head generates substantial compression force; and concomitantly pressurizes the viscous fluid disposed in the bore volume of the cylinder, thereby limiting the formation of air bubbles.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0135\">4. In some instances and embodiments one or more internal surfaces of the cylinder sidewall are serrated along its periphery or margins. These surface serrations aid in controlling the rate of flow for the moving hydraulic fluid when compressed. Accordingly, some embodiments will employ a cylinder sidewall whose surface is longitudinally-grooved along some or all of its periphery margins.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0136\">5. In some format implementations of the ITTEM apparatus, the cylinder&#39;s diameter and/or roundness will vary in a non-linear fashion to produce specific damping-characteristics at specific increments of the overall stroke.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0137\">Also, in other format implementations, the compartment constituting the fluid-containing spatial region and/or the compartment constituting the gas-containing spatial region will be formed as a discrete and isolatable cartridge which can be independently inserted into and then reside for an extended time period within the apparatus; and then, when necessary or desired, be able to be entirely removable on-demand from that apparatus. This particular construction mode for the ITTEM apparatus allows for quick and easy replacement of component parts\u2014a very desirable feature where very heavily use of the vehicle is the norm.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0138\">6. A flexible cylinder assembly embodiment of the ITTEM apparatus, which is has come to be called the \u201cElastoSil Damper\u201d, is optionally available as a structural alternative construction to the other formats previously described herein. The major features and marked advantages of the \u201cElastoSil Damper\u201d are given below.\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0009-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0010-0001\" num=\"0139\">The structure of the flexible cylinder assembly typically incorporates or affixes a flexible reservoir for the hydraulic fluid during damping and from which the fluid returns to the cylinder during rebound. Also, the flexible cylinder may or may not be optionally surrounded by a discrete flexible compressed-gas-jacket to allow adjustment of the rebound strength and ride-height.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0002\" num=\"0140\">This flexible cylinder assembly embodiment can either be a damper apparatus with limited inherent rebound from its flexible material; or be a semi-gas-adjustable standalone vehicle suspension solution, as is illustrated by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0003\" num=\"0141\">In the latter format and construction shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, the outer reservoir of the flexible cylinder assembly should be nearly full height and should have a compressed-gas torus jacket completely covering it. Via this structural arrangement, gaseous inflation applies pressure to the entire ElastoSil Damper apparatus; which in turn, allows such inflation to vary the load-bearing capabilities greatly for the vehicle and to adjust the ride-height of the vehicle to a smaller degree.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0004\" num=\"0142\">As an alternative choice and option, the flexible cylinder assembly construction is typically made so that the flexible reservoir for the hydraulic fluid includes at least one aperture whose gap space serves as a flow control valve and whose annular gap can be actively or mechanically varied using a tapered annular insert and an actuator or adjustment screw. The direction of taper and details of the associated baffle and mounting constitute one (but certainly not the only) effective means to control whether damping force increases with stroke speed or decreases with stroke speed in either the down-stroke or the up-stroke.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0005\" num=\"0143\">Yet another variant format is a flexible-cylinder with a convex insert, such that the maximum aperture gap is at zero-flow. This particular format increases damping with each increase of fluid flow; allows damping to be applied to both the up-stroke and the down-stroke of the piston mechanism; will cause a reverse effect and result when the smallest annular gap is set for zero-flow of fluid; and will produce decreasing damping effects with increased fluid flow/stroke-speed. For best results, the convex insert is made a part of the base-plate; and the base-plate/insert combination can be cast or otherwise manufactured in one piece for subsequent use as the heat-dissipation means.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0006\" num=\"0144\">In addition, the flexible cylinder can incorporate or have affixed a flexible reservoir for the fluid during damping and from which the fluid returns to the cylinder during rebound. Also, a flexible cylinder optionally may be surrounded by or affixed to a flexible compressed-gas-jacket to allow adjustment of the rebound strength and ride-height.</li> <li id=\"ul0010-0007\" num=\"0145\">Definitionally therefore, this alternative, but highly desirable, flexible structural format is recited as follows:</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0146\">An inertial terrain transit event manager apparatus comprising:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0126\" num=\"0147\">a flexible cylinder assembly including\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0011-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0012-0001\" num=\"0148\">(i) a flexible first elongated hollow cylinder chamber having an end wall with a pre-sized opening and an associated base-plate, a closed end wall, at least two discrete flexible sidewalls, and an extended internal bore volume;</li> <li id=\"ul0012-0002\" num=\"0149\">(ii) a flexible second elongated hollow cylinder shell enclosing the sidewalls of said first cylinder chamber, said second cylinder shell presenting a second extended bore volume and providing at least two nested separated hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions connected by passageways through said associated base plate at the end wall of said first cylinder chamber;</li> <li id=\"ul0012-0003\" num=\"0150\">(iii) a flexible third hollow cylinder framework enclosing said sidewalls of said first and first cylinder chamber and said second cylinder shell, said flexible third cylinder framework constituting a discrete gas-containing spatial region positioned for on-demand application of pressurized gas to compress said nested separated hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions of said enclosed second cylinder shell;</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0127\" num=\"0151\">a fixed piston mechanism disposed and affixed to said base-plate of the extended internal bore volume of said cylinder assembly, said piston mechanism being comprised of\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0013-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0014-0001\" num=\"0152\">(\u03b1) a piston head located within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions, and</li> <li id=\"ul0014-0002\" num=\"0153\">(\u03b2) a base plate supporting said piston mechanism and containing an aperture valve with fluid flow passages connecting the first and second hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions via the gap space of said aperture valve;</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0128\" num=\"0154\">a viscous hydraulic fluid capable of motion disposed within the compartment volumes of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial regions of said cylinder assembly, wherein compression force and kinetic energy is imparted to said viscous hydraulic fluid via the displacement of said piston head within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0129\" num=\"0155\">a compressible gas held at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume said gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder assembly;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0130\" num=\"0156\">intrinsic damping-force control means joined to that portion of said piston located within the compartment volume of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region of said cylinder assembly, wherein said intrinsic damping-force control means is comprised of</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0131\" num=\"0157\">a preformed article which\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0015-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0016-0001\" num=\"0158\">(i) has known dimensions and configuration,</li> <li id=\"ul0016-0002\" num=\"0159\">(ii) is fashioned of a deformable material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion,</li> <li id=\"ul0016-0003\" num=\"0160\">(iii) is able to absorb the resistance of said viscous hydraulic fluid when compressed within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region,</li> <li id=\"ul0016-0004\" num=\"0161\">(iv) is able to impart changes to the flow angle and flow rate of said viscous hydraulic fluid within said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region,</li> <li id=\"ul0016-0005\" num=\"0162\">(v) is sufficient to convert at least a portion of the kinetic energy then present in said flowing viscous hydraulic fluid into heat, and</li> <li id=\"ul0016-0006\" num=\"0163\">an annular gap of temperature variable size located between said preformed article and each cylinder sidewall of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region, said annular gap serving as a higher-temperature size expanding and lower-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve which allows temperature-differing quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through during the up-stroke and down-stroke movement of said piston mechanism;

The Piston Mechanism</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0133\" num=\"0165\">1. The piston head of the piston mechanism can alternatively be: a solid construction without primary orifices or valve openings in the piston head; or a piston head having a variety of features over its exposed surfaces and faces. Exemplary instances of the latter situation include the nesting of similar or different peripheral-valve implementations, such as a nested piston in a receptacle on the piston face; or a flexible cylinder peripheral valve damper affixed to one or both piston faces.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0134\" num=\"0166\">Also, in accordance with the invention, the piston head can alternatively be formed as a single article structure or a unified multipart core entity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0135\" num=\"0167\">2. In addition, the topography of the compression-stroke surface face of said piston can be flat surfaced or pre-configured. When the face surface is to be configured, the particular shape for the exposed surface can be selected from one or a combination of shapes selected from the group consisting of: helical, conic, domed, concave, parabolic doomed, parabolic concave, and concave torodial, and concave-Flat \u201cPle-Pan\u201d\u2014the last for the creation of rotating toroidal \u201cSmoke-Ring\u201d vortexes at the piston-face surfaces.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0136\" num=\"0168\">This wide range and variety of optional surface face shapes provide additional effective means for tailoring the passive minima and maxima of the damping-force, and the damping-rate, as well as for controlling the damping-force distribution over the range of piston stroke and acceleration of stroke, as well as for managing the effectiveness of conversion of kinetic energy into heat.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0169\">3. The application of one or more known surface finishes for the metals, ceramics, and composites used in construction of the piston head provide additional means for tailoring the passive minima and maxima of damping-force and damping-rate and damping-force distribution over the ITTEM apparatus&#39; range of stroke and acceleration of stroke. This is achieved by using the above-mentioned choices of surface finishes and shapes in combination to control vortex formation (including but not limited to ring-vortex formation at the piston faces), velocity-gradient, laminar and turbulent flow, and other fluidic and/or surface-effects that influence friction, drag, and other fluidic factors which influence the damping and rebounding characteristics of an ITTEM.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0138\" num=\"0170\">4. The piston rod or rod can optionally be formed as either a solid metal article or as a hollow metal member. One highly desirable implementation of the hollow piston rod format is illustrated by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, which shows both an elastosil piston-buffer and a nested piston peak-pressure limiter.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0171\">The elastosil piston-buffer is merely one format implementation of the flexible-cylinder peripheral valve damper. In contrast, the nested piston peak-pressure limiter is a floating piston nested within the primary piston; and has a position within the tapered bore in that primary piston which is controlled by a constant-force spring mechanism, so that movement of the nested piston only occurs when stroke-ward face transient peak pressure exceeds a preset threshold value.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0140\" num=\"0172\">It will be noted and appreciated that, in formats of the present invention using a hollow piston rod, it is requires the piston rod be substantially larger in girth or diameter size; and additionally employ the hollow piston rod in a constant-volume chamber and open to the gas-pressurized region of the cylinder. This mode of construction will provide a larger sized, fully-compressed gas volume for the tailoring of the compression-stroke effects upon the gas and/or the hydraulic fluid\u2014in that it allows engineering control over the ratio between minimum full-extension and maximum full-compression gas pressure. Furthermore, this form of construction allows marked weight-savings for the piston rod itself; and because of internal pressurization within the hollow rod, it is far more buckle-resistant for any given linear length and material weight.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0141\" num=\"0173\">Optionally, a bellows assembly may also be affixed to the hollow-piston-rod as a source of reference-pressure, to communicate with the piston mechanism through the hollow piston rod. The use for and value of this optional bellows assembly is the determination of load and fraction of stroke remaining, and/or to provide additional rebound/normalization capability.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0142\" num=\"0174\">5. In addition, if and when a hollow piston rod format and construction is chosen, this construction can optionally also use an internally-telescoping upper member which allows for overall height adjustment on-demand for the piston rod. One format of this optional feature is a turn-buckle arrangement located near the upper attachment point; and is provided with lock-nuts for each end of the turn-buckle, so that the height adjustment (kneeling) can be locked with complete rigidity.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0143\" num=\"0175\">The ability to mechanically lower the ride-height of a vehicle, such as a helicopter or ground vehicle, in the fashion described above, is highly prized within military applications where the vehicle or aircraft in question must present a lower profile for space requirements aboard a transport aircraft for effective use of the cargo space. This structural format allows the lowering of ride-height while retaining suspension in order that the loading and unloading of the lowered vehicle from its air transport retains suspension protection from bottoming-out-impacts which could damage the lowered vehicle.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0144\" num=\"0176\">6. It is often desirable that the piston head or its associated structures further comprise at least one side-load bearing member which has one or more recesses of determined size and shape disposed in an outer peripheral edge thereof in order to allow bushing-like contact by the side-load bearing member to the cylinder wall without blocking fluid flow. This is needed to retain concentricity of the piston-body and shaft with the cylinders comprising the damper, against side loads, including applications such as Macpherson Strut type suspension where the damper provides the axis of steering, serving as the steering pivot as well as a damper.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0145\" num=\"0177\">7. The piston mechanism as a whole is a solid construction which optionally can comprise multiple discrete piston segments, which may be fixed or mobile units relative to each other; and may be formed as nested units, or serially stacked units, or be an arranged organization of both nested and serially stacked units. Consequently, all combinations and permutations of nested and/or serially stacked piston segments\u2014regardless of their size, number, or structural complexity\u2014lie within the scope of the present invention.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0146\" num=\"0178\">8. In many preferred embodiments, the piston head will optionally includes a thermal expansion member. The thermal expansion member can be a separate segment of the piston; or it can be formed as a baffle made of an appropriate thermally expansive material.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0147\" num=\"0179\">Accordingly, the fully constructed piston head optionally may have one or more thermal expansion members attached to it; and also optionally includes one or more controllable (passively or actively by heat, pressure, or fluid-flow rate) fluid-flow-restrictive members; and optionally additionally have one or more discrete baffle members associated therewith, each such optionally present baffle member being actively or passively deformable in response to the flow movement of the silicone oil or other hydraulic fluid. It is noteworthy that with each of these optional, but highly desirable structural formats, the size of the annular gap will either increase or decrease\u2014the specific change in question being imparted by the dynamic flow of the fluid (and directional movement of the piston stroke within the extended bore volume of the cylinder), and the operating temperature(s) at which the apparatus is used.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0148\" num=\"0180\">9. Many constructions of the inertial terrain transit event manager apparatus will exemplify the particular circumstance where the piston head and the cylinder are formed of materials having substantially equal coefficients of thermal expansion. In the alternative, however, many embodiments will present constructs in which where the piston head or its optionally present thermally-expanding member, and the cylinder, are formed of materials having markedly different coefficients of thermal expansion.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0149\" num=\"0181\">In these circumstances, the material substances are chosen so that the fluid displacement for a given damper-stroke or fraction thereof will produce the same or nearly the same damping, regardless of environmental temperature variations or fluid and damper temperature variations engendered by extreme damping activity. The materials chosen for the piston head or its optionally present thermally-expanding member, will in this case, have a greater thermal coefficient of expansion than the substance forming the cylinder. Consequently, as the operational temperature rises and the hydraulic fluid becomes less viscous, the thermally-expanding member (such as a baffle) will expand at a greater rate than the material substance of the cylinder, thus reducing the size of the annular gap (peripheral valve) and thereby constricting its valving function to produce the same resistance and damping with the warmed fluid as it did with the cooler fluid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0150\" num=\"0182\">10. In some use instances and applications, the piston head will comprise an appropriately-shaped retaining member, and a piston or piston-segment member, with a thermal expansion member interdisposed between them. Typically, the appropriately-shaped retaining member, and the piston or piston-segment member, are made of a pre-selected material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion which is less than or equal to that of the thermal expansion member and/or similar to the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0151\" num=\"0183\">In the alternative, there are a number of use conditions under which the thermal expansion member is selected to have a coefficient of thermal expansion greater than the conical-shaped leading member and the load-bearing element.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0152\" num=\"0184\">11. The piston mechanism of the ITTEM apparatus optionally may comprise and include one or more adjacently disposed segments having serrated or longitudinal grooves or a series of baffles with serrations in their periphery. Typically, the grooved or serrated periphery face surfaces of the segments or baffles lie exposed within the compartment volume of the hydraulic fluid-containing region; are longitudinally moveable by associated springy or elastic mechanisms such as elastomeric o-rings, and are radially moveable as well, thereby allowing them to function as a baffle.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0153\" num=\"0185\">The means and control for causing such radial movement is provided by interfacing the series of adjacently disposed segments or baffles to each other using a spiral-spline shaft which extends from the disk-surface of one of the segments and/or baffles to engage a slip-fitting spiral-spline socket in the adjacent segment and/or baffle; or by additional springy or elastic means joined to the segment or baffle, and which can be provided by the intrinsic elasticity of the baffle material itself.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0154\" num=\"0186\">The series of segments and baffles are specifically aligned; and function, when the system is at rest, to vary the alignment of the grooves or serrations of one segment or baffle to those of the next segment or baffle of the series in response to fluid-flow and pressure, over a range from fully-aligned to fully occluded/misaligned. Thus, if and when occluded, the peripheral fluid-flow through the grooves or serrations in the series of segments and baffles would be nearly occluded for great damping force; and alignment of the grooves or serrations would allow considerably more fluid-flow for a softer damping-force. In the case of spiral grooves or serrations the alignment-occlusion can be accomplished without a spiral-spline arrangement.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0016\">C. The Hydraulic Fluid-Containing Spatial Region</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0155\" num=\"0187\">1. The compartment volume of the fluid-containing spatial region of the cylinder is filled with a slightly compressible silicone-based fluid of elevated viscosity which preferably exhibits pseudo-plastic flow under extreme shear; and which desirably can be blended at will into viscous fluids having a viscosity ranging from about 10 centistokes to about 600,000 centistokes; and which will preferably have a viscosity temperature coefficient below about 0.6.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0156\" num=\"0188\">2. A highly preferred hydraulic fluid is polydimethylsiloxane silicone fluid which exhibits the desired characteristics and properties. A commercially available polydimethylsiloxane silicone fluid is 200(R), 50 CST hydraulic fluid manufactured and sold by Dow Corning Corporation. Many similar commercially sold hydraulic fluids are also commonly known and available.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0157\" num=\"0189\">3. It is desirable that a non-absorbent and compressible medium, of a type including but not limited to an inflatable-toroidal-diaphragm and/or a closed cell sponge neoprene ring, is optionally provided within the compartment volume of the hydraulic-fluid region, at either or both ends of the chamber. When present, this non-absorbent, compressible medium may or may not be inflated as such; can alternatively be preloaded before or after apparatus assembly; and when present can be compressed by the flowing hydraulic fluid as it travels within the cylinder. The resistance of the non-absorbent, compressible medium to this compression force serves to pressurize the hydraulic-fluid containing compartment, thus limiting the formation of air bubbles.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0158\" num=\"0190\">Also, in accordance with alternative embodiments of the ITTEM apparatus, the cylinder may have a internal bore configuration of constant or varied diameter, depending upon the application and intended use circumstances.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0017\">D. The Gas-Containing Spatial Region</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0159\" num=\"0191\">1. The gas-containing region and its compressible gas serve as an effective shock absorbing compartment for the apparatus as a whole. Attention is emphatically directed to the particular functions provided by the gas-containing region. Once filled with a predetermined mass of gas\u2014which corresponds, at any specific increment of the piston&#39;s stroke to a predetermined pressure\u2014the compressible gas lying within the gas-containing region serves as a positional reference-pressure source, as an effective pressure source by which to counteract in part the shock effect caused by the impact contact forces; and, optionally, also serves as the immediate rebounding means for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0160\" num=\"0192\">2. In all typical and complete embodiments of the ITTEM apparatus, a compressible gas is held (for any given piston-stroke position and direction) at a predetermined pressure within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region of said cylinder; and this compressed gaseous mass thus serves as a reference pressure volume for the intrinsic damping-force control means located elsewhere within the apparatus. In addition, the pressurized gas within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region optionally can serve as a normalization/rebound chamber for the apparatus as a whole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0161\" num=\"0193\">This structural rule and circumstance holds true for each format of the ITTEM apparatus as a whole. However, there are in reality two recognized and expected exceptions to this general rule, which are: Those specialized circumstances such as the retrofit of a vehicle which compels or allows for only the use of a conventionally known shock absorber as a replacement; and those particular kinds of vehicles where the existing rebounding mechanism in place (such as a metal spring mechanism) precludes the use of any gas rebounding apparatus in any form. In these instances, the presently described ITTEM apparatus as such cannot be usefully employed.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0162\" num=\"0194\">3. The compressed gas contained within the compartment volume of the gas-containing spatial region is a rebounding medium. A rebounding medium has a specific stored energy; and, in the case of a compressed gas, is measurable as a specific pressure. Direct sensing of that internal gaseous pressure (as well as the transient pressure-rise at the strokeward face of the piston) allows the piston to intrinsically respond to the actual sink-rate and the actual inertial load; and to configure itself for the appropriate damping based on those factors and the remaining stroke length available to damp the kinetic fraction of the current inertial load; thereby delivering the preferred deceleration solution which is to apply a constant deceleration force for the remaining stroke length or part thereof in order to reach zero piston velocity at or before the end point of available stroke-length.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0018\">E. The Intrinsic Damping Control Means</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0163\" num=\"0195\">1. In each embodiment of the ITTEM apparatus, structural intrinsic damping-force control means are integrally joined to that portion of said piston mechanism located within the internal bore volume of the cylinder. As a consequence of being located within the cylinder volume, the intrinsic damping-force control means can be constructed as either passive structural entities or active structural devices. Thus, a free choice exists and is available between the passive and active formats.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0196\">2. By definition, a passive form of intrinsic damping-force control means is a hydrodynamic, and/or flexural, and/or mechanical construct able to respond to variations of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and/or piston position within the cylinder. Such passive intrinsic damping-force control means produce the required damping without external reference.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0165\" num=\"0197\">As the alternative model, an active form of intrinsic damping-force control means is, by definition, electronically referenced to the damper&#39;s internal environmental variations of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and/or piston position within the cylinder. As such, the electronic module or other electro-mechanical controlling device will always be located in-situ and be positioned to exert fluid flow control internally within the available bore volume of the cylinder; will electronically and/or electro-mechanically activate and engage the passive Intrinsic structural formats in order to produce and control the required damping force; and are capable of interacting with or referencing one or more inputs sent from sources located outside of and/or remotely from the bore volume of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0166\" num=\"0198\">3. Accordingly, structurally and without regard to type or manner of construction, each and every format of intrinsic damping-force control means will comprise:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0017-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0018-0001\" num=\"0199\">A preformed article which\\n        <ul> <li id=\"ul0019-0001\" num=\"0200\">(i) has known dimensions and configuration,</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0002\" num=\"0201\">(ii) is fashioned of a deformable material having a known coefficient of thermal expansion,</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0003\" num=\"0202\">(iii) is able to absorb the resistance of said viscous silicone-based fluid when compressed within the hydraulic fluid-containing region,</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0004\" num=\"0203\">(iv) is able to impart changes to the flow angle and flow rate of said viscous hydraulic fluid when compressed within the hydraulic fluid-containing region,</li> <li id=\"ul0019-0005\" num=\"0204\">(v) is sufficient to convert at least a portion of the kinetic energy then present in the flowing viscous hydraulic fluid into heat; and</li> </ul>\\n        </li> <li id=\"ul0018-0002\" num=\"0205\">An annular gap of dynamically adjustable and temperature variable size located between said reformed article and each cylinder sidewall of said hydraulic fluid-containing spatial region, the annular gap serving as a lower-temperature size expanding and higher-temperature size narrowing peripheral valve which allows dynamically altered and temperature differing quantities of flowing viscous hydraulic fluid to pass through during the up-stroke and down-stroke movement of the piston mechanism.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0167\" num=\"0206\">4. Among the many structural formats available and suitable for use as the chosen Intrinsic damping-force control means, one highly preferred instance and example are fluid-flow restrictive members\u2014which typically appear as one or more baffle-like articles, with or without an electronically activated supporting side-load bearing member.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0168\" num=\"0207\">These baffle-like articles can be a separate component attached to the piston rod, or be a formed feature on a face surface of the piston head, or be disposed upon and attached to an internal surface face of the cylinder sidewalls.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0169\" num=\"0208\">Typically, each baffle-like article is:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0170\" num=\"0209\">(i) a discrete structural feature of predetermined dimensions and overall configuration;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0171\" num=\"0210\">(ii) desirably is integrally joined to a portion of the piston rod;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0172\" num=\"0211\">(iii) is fashioned and constituted of a chemically stable and resilient formulation;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0173\" num=\"0212\">(iv) is tangibly deformable in-situ when responding to the flowing wave motions of the viscous oil (or other viscous liquid) employed as a hydraulic fluid; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0174\" num=\"0213\">(v) will thereby either increase or decrease the hydraulic fluid resistance within the cylinder\u2014the mode of fluid flow resistance modification in question being imparted to the moving hydraulic fluid by the particular direction of the traveling piston head (during the down-stroke and the up-stroke) within the elongated bore volume of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0175\" num=\"0214\">5. The annular gap comprising part of the intrinsic damping-force control means will always have a perimeter edge of measurable spatial size (or diameter); and will always exist as a discernible entity between the periphery of the fluid-flow restrictive member (typically a baffle-like article) and the cylinder sidewalls or the piston. This annular gap will spatially act as a peripheral valve\u2014i.e., a sized gateway or controlled portal for open channel flow travel of the comp, ebbed hydraulic fluid around the piston head.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0176\" num=\"0215\">The perimeter size (diameter or width dimension) of the annular gap can and will vary over the scale of fractions of the individual damping stroke; and will be a function of the hydrodynamic and flexural variations in the baffle-like article&#39;s shape and performance\u2014based on the expected changes of fluid flow, fluid pressure, and piston stroke position within the cylinder bore. The expansion and contractions of perimeter size for the annular gap will produce the desired damping effects.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0177\" num=\"0216\">In addition, the perimeter size (diameter or width) of the annular gap is only limited by the configuration of the baffle-like article and the piston&#39;s cylindrical surface (including its leading and trailing edges). Thus, the perimeter edge and overall spatial size of the annular gap can be prepared and set to be of constant or varied dimension. This capability allows and enables the open channel pathway to accommodate and meaningfully control extremely large variations of fluid-flow speed and fluid flow direction for any given stroke-position and speed of piston motion relative to the hydraulic fluid.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0178\" num=\"0217\">6. Note that under increasing ambient or internally generated operating temperatures, the preformed baffle article (or other fluid-flow resistance means) becomes increasingly heated, thermally expands, and dimensionally grows into ever-closer adjacent proximity with the internal surface of the solid cylinder sidewalls; and thereby will markedly narrow the overall size/diameter for the open channel pathway of the annular gap then existing between the preformed baffle article and the cylinder sidewall.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0179\" num=\"0218\">Conversely, the occurrence of lower ambient operating temperatures will cause this annular gap to increase in aperture size/diameter; and thereby offer a larger-sized open channel pathway for a more rapid flow of the viscous hydraulic fluid passing through. Under these operational circumstances and in this manner, the overall resistance provided by the intrinsic damping-force control means to fluidic flow remains substantially constant, regardless of hydraulic fluid viscosity changes caused by ambient or internally generated operating temperatures.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0180\" num=\"0219\">7. Consequently, damping performance for the apparatus is consistently and uniformly maintained under all realistic operating conditions, even under extremes of cold and heat. It will be noted also that the internally generated heat is centered and focused at that zone of the ITTEM apparatus where ambient cooling is most available; and the thermally expanding annular gap allows the piston assembly to convert the kinetic energy of impact and vibration into heat by hydrodynamic means at the interface between the piston/baffle system, avoiding significant heating of the bulk silicone fluid by \u201csqueegeeing\u201d the heat up and down the cylinder wall surfaces for dissipation into the environment.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0019\">F. Extrinsically Activated Damping-Force Control Means</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0181\" num=\"0220\">1. When optionally present, the extrinsically activated damping-force control means will be in part internally positioned within the internal bore volume of the cylinder, and in-part remotely located from the piston mechanism of the ITTEM apparatus. The extrinsic activation and communication controls, such as the electronic module shown by <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref>, will always lie at a fixed or known distance away and are separated from the cylinder; but will be in on-demand and active control communication with the implementation devices then disposed internally within the bore volume of the cylinder. The exact location of these remotely positioned electronic controls will vary with the particulars of the electronics chosen and the specific application requirements.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0182\" num=\"0221\">2. The extrinsically activated damping-force control means can be integrated with a variety of devices and structures then located and implemented within the internal bore volume of the cylinder, for operation remotely. Merely exemplifying these internally located implementation devices are the following:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0183\" num=\"0222\">(i) A piezoelectric ring located around the piston head which expands radially when activated;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0184\" num=\"0223\">(ii) A piezoelectrically-valved, inflatable-ring peripheral orifice choke working off differential pressure from one side of the piston to the other\u2014with the result that a large hydro mechanical force is controlled by the electronics;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0185\" num=\"0224\">(iii) One or more configured \u201cmission-adaptive\u201d composite baffle structures which can be activated on-demand and purposefully directed to become either more curved or less curved in radial shape and orientation, and thus be either increased or decreased in topographical contact surface distance to meet different rates of viscous fluid flow.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0186\" num=\"0225\">3. Owing to the nature of electronic controlling devices and systems, a source of reliable electric power must be provided for operational acts. For superior damping results, the desirable electric power source(s) for activating and operating the extrinsically activated damping-force control means can take various forms, such as super capacitors; storage batteries; and other well known conventional energy sources. These electric power sources typically are fixed either externally to the ITTEM apparatus; or are positioned internally within the interior bore volume of the cylinder in the ITTEM apparatus, at pre-chosen multiple locations, including but not limited to the piston mechanism.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0187\" num=\"0226\">In addition, the true source of electric power can take one or more alternative forms, including rotary brushless generator/alternator devices associated with the piston mechanism and spun by \u201crifling\u201d to catch fluid-flow (tailor-made for dual-piston and elongated piston implementations. For example, in a linear-reciprocating generation embodiment, one or more discrete magnets can be positioned upon the outside of the lower \u201cmoving\u201d leg of the strut, or the strut itself can be magnetized; or a magnetized spring is positioned below the piston head. Any of these alternative models will allow the generation of power on the piston using a coil and a rectifier.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0188\" num=\"0227\">4. The controlling electronics, located either externally or internally within the ITTEM apparatus itself, enables granularity for the system; and makes the sensing and the processing of data space-wise and time-wise local to the events. This, in turn, provides quick detection of fluid flow changes and allows the processing of detected data to be very rapid and time-effective; and results in the electronically controlled system to meet and effectively manage the quickly changing shock impact event(s), namely the synchronization of damping speed and damping intensity with the piston stroke movement.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0189\" num=\"0228\">In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the physical implementation of the algorithm governing the ITTEM apparatus as a whole may include a control mechanism implementing a mechanical negative feedback control loop to expand or contract the baffle\u2014and thereby seek a particular fluid pressure regardless of travel speed as a way of providing a uniform damping force from beginning of movement to zero velocity at the end of the stroke.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0190\" num=\"0229\">5. An on-demand electronic controlling system can be prepared, interconnected, and networked via conventional electrical linking means including: radio, wires, optical fibers, and even swarming methods; and usefully function as an operative system including the capability to modify behavior performance based on the previous shock&#39;s experience of the road; as well as interact with the vehicle&#39;s other on-board systems to preemptively damp effectively for an upcoming event (like a missile launch or a detected blast wave, etc.).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0191\" num=\"0230\">As merely one truly unusual example, an appropriate ITTEM apparatus and system capable of actually jumping away from and minimizing (if not completely avoiding) the injurious effects of an explosive detonation would employ a ride-height implementation control structure which is automated and may be decoupled from the spring function of the vehicle\u2014thereby reducing the relative velocity of the explosive blast wave and the segment of the blast zone to which the vehicle is exposed, while also increasing distance from the blast center, based on detection equipment signals.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0020\">III. Modes of Damping Provided by the Present Invention</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0192\" num=\"0231\">A. The ITTEM apparatus can act to provide a variety of damping capabilities which are functionally unique and can be separated into four alternative modes of damping. All of these modes exist simultaneously; and all these modes function (with some variation in overlap characteristics) transitioning from mode to mode automatically with increases or decreases in fluid flow velocity. However, which of these appears as the \u201cdominant\u201d mode of the moment is a function of and dependent upon the particular fluid flow velocity then in effect.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0193\" num=\"0232\">This is one the major features of and distinguishing differences for the ITTEM apparatus in comparison to most conventionally known damping devices, all of which are position or displacement dependent. The ITTEM apparatus most notably is independent of displacement, but is unusually sensitive and completely reactive to even very small changes in the velocity of fluid flow.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0194\" num=\"0233\">B. The four alternative modes of damping are:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0195\" num=\"0234\">(1) Velocity Squared Damping</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0196\" num=\"0235\">With this damping mode, for every incremental increase in fluid flow velocity, the resistive force increases as a \u201csquare\u201d of the increment of increase relative to the initial velocity. For example, if the velocity increases by a factor of 2, the delta damping force increase is a magnitude four (4) times greater than the original.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0197\" num=\"0236\">(2) Viscous Damping</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0198\" num=\"0237\">In this mode, for each incremental increase in flow velocity, there is a resulting linear effective increase of resistive force. Thus, the resistive force is produced by the size (typically the piston cross-sectional area) of the object being forced through the damping medium. The force is also then, a factor of the viscosity of the damping medium. This mode appears and is functional in the upper range of subsonic flow and extends to a lower mid-range of velocities.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0199\" num=\"0238\">(3) Dashpot Damping</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0200\" num=\"0239\">Dashpot damping is best understood by thinking of the classic screen door dampers that were intended to slow the motion of the door and to lessen the impact force when the door hit the door jam. Thus, at the slowest fluid flow velocities, the device acts as a dashpot, resembling a classic \u201cscreen door\u201d damper. Because this mode becomes dominant at slower rates of fluid flow, it resembles pushing a flat faced plunger through highly viscous fluid, thus producing resistive force.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0201\" num=\"0240\">(4) Machian Damping</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0202\" num=\"0241\">Machian damping relates to the transonic and faster-flow characteristics from subsonic to supersonic flow, from supersonic to hypersonic flow. Specifically, the transition from subsonic flow to supersonic or higher Machian flow is a speed-dependent damping-force component\u2014in that during the Machian regime of fluid flow, the resistance increases with speed. This holds true for each transition; and thus demonstrates that a piston made so as to have more than one region where the annular gap increases (slowing fluid speed) and then decreases again (causing another subsonic-Machian transition)\u2014will have more than one Machian source of damping.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0203\" num=\"0242\">Where the bow-wave or shockwave entrains within the annular gap (in the case of fluid-flow rates greater than 1) and bounces multiple times before exiting the gap, at even fairly slow strokes, this event forms a variably-permeable virtual seal which spans the annular gap; and constitutes the standing wave/mach-cone and related high-mach-number events occurring in the fluid passing the piston and its valving members. It is also clear that higher-mach-number events such as standing waves formed in flow-channels including but not limited to the annular space can be used as flow control and flow diverters which are velocity-dependent, since at a given mach number the standing waves are repeatable as to position and shape. Thus fluid-logic and switching based on the standing waves allows a much finer, more granular\u2014at very small increments of resolution of time and/or space\u2014control of the ITTEM&#39;s high-speed damping characteristics.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0204\" num=\"0243\">Switching from low-speed damping (where the fluid-flow through the adaptive damping-means is subsonic) to transonic-supersonic can be hydrodynamically initiated and controlled by means including but not limited to the coanda effect and it&#39;s breakdown as fluid speed approaches the transonic value and higher.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0205\" num=\"0244\">In the Machian and fractional-mach regimes, the fluid passing the annular gap exhibits many useful characteristics which can be directed by those skilled in the hydrodynamic and damping sciences and arts to tailor damping evidenced by the ITTEM, characteristics including but not limited to laminar and turbulent flow, as well as piston-face-following coanda flow, in varying combinations according to the specific tailoring of the ITTEM and its current fluid-flow rate; the mach-cone waves also serve to efficiently transform kinetic impact-energy into heat, \u201cabsorbing shocks\u201d and dissipating that kinetic energy as heat locally through the shell of the cylinder.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0021\">IV.

Expected Uses and Intended Applications for the ITTEM Apparatus</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0208\" num=\"0246\">1. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the ITTEM is adapted for uses in which side loadings or bending forces are encountered\u2014e.g., MacPherson struts.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0209\" num=\"0247\">Under these operational conditions, a load-bearing element having a plurality of peripheral ports alternated with load-bearing segments is employed in association with the piston head; or, alternatively, the fluid flow can be primarily in an external channel connecting the end points of the cylinder, at or beyond the maximum travel points of the piston.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0210\" num=\"0248\">However, for a McPherson-Strut application, the side-load would be better done with bushings having large flow ports, such bushings being independent of the annular gap.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0211\" num=\"0249\">2. The ITTEM apparatus is particular suited and adapted for use in aviation or for other applications involving those entities commonly known as oleo struts. For these embodiments, a separate gas pressurization canister is concentrically disposed about and reciprocally engaged with the rebound end of the cylinder in the ITTEM apparatus.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0212\" num=\"0250\">Those skilled in the art will appreciate and understand that the ITTEM apparatus intended for aircraft use or oleo strut applications presents structural improvements, progressive compression, and rebound valving; and also eliminates fluid contamination and leakage. In these embodiments, there are no piston seals or other wear parts crucial to compression dampening.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0213\" num=\"0251\">3. Other expected uses of and intended applications for the ITTEM apparatus include, but are not limited to:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0214\" num=\"0252\">(a) Damping for seat mounts in MRAP type vehicles, particularly suited to embodiments such as 3-axis-of-freedom seat mounts using progressive coil-springs to create preload at the zero point;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0215\" num=\"0253\">(b) Truck body isolation dampers;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0216\" num=\"0254\">(c) Hydraulically regenerative vehicle-leveling and CG-management systems;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0217\" num=\"0255\">(d) Embodiments with integrated springs added to inertial reel seat-belt lock systems and which allow impact attenuation;</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0218\" num=\"0256\">(e) Earthquake dampers for buildings; and</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0219\" num=\"0257\">(f) Deck and equipment silent mountings in submarines.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0220\" num=\"0258\">The present invention is not limited in form nor restricted in scope except by the claims appended hereto:</p>\\n    \\n  </description>\\n  ', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'This application claims priority to the French Patent Application No. 1600895 filed on Jun. 2, 2016, the content of which is incorporated in its entirety herein. \\n     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n     The invention relates to a system for reversibly fastening a decorative lining on a surface of a leathercraft article made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material. \\n     Modern methods of cutting metal sheets make it possible to produce, from metals such as steel, brass, copper, aluminium, silver or gold, varied and fine cuts-outs comprising in particular piercings of different shapes, to produce items of jewellery. \\n     It is known to fasten in a permanent manner on the inner face of the cut metal sheet a slightly flexible lining appearing through openings in said metal sheet, having a different aspect and colours in order to produce a decorative aesthetic effect. \\n     Preferably, for the inner lining flexible materials are used, such as natural or synthetic fabrics, or leather. The rigid metal sheet then gives the general shape of the item of jewellery, as well as an exterior aspect that is resistant to wear, which may be shiny, satin or matt, and the inner lining forms a more flexible and warmer material, of which the nature, the aspect and the colour clearly stand out on the metal and appears through the decorative piercings. \\n     It is notably possible to produce bracelets, wristlets, belts, breastpins, ear pendants or chokers as well as rings and necklaces, comprising a cut metal sheet forming a rigid structure having a particular curve depending on its function. For example, bracelets formed in a strip of rolled metal sheet are produced, having an opening making it possible to pass the wrist in an adjusted manner. \\n     BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     A first objective of the present invention is to be able to propose this type of decorative element for leathercraft articles. In this case, the decorative element is not worn directly on the skin of the user, but has to be fastened on a flexible surface, such as fabric, leather or similar materials. \\n     Furthermore, a problem that is posed with this type of jewellery is that with an inner lining fastened in a permanent manner on the metal sheet by different means to ensure a good maintaining as well as a pinning under the metal sheet, it is then not possible to change this lining in a simple and rapid manner. \\n     Thus, a detachment of the lining generally requires the use of specialised tooling to remove notably tightening screws or rivets, and may damage the elements. The dismantling and reassembly operation may be slow and delicate so as to conserve an impeccable aspect and a finish in order to justify the decorative function. \\n     It is then not possible to produce rapidly variants of the same decorative element, by changing the lining or the decorative metal sheet, whereas it is sought more and more to personalise fashion accessories to adapt them for example to the clothes worn, the types of activities planned, or to a need for frequent renewal so as not to repeat a same decoration. \\n     The objective of the present invention is notably to avoid these drawbacks of the prior art and to enable a reversible fastening of a decorative lining on a flexible surface of a leathercraft article. \\n     Reversible fastening is taken to mean a fastening that can be done and undone without a tool. On the contrary, permanent fastening is taken to mean a fastening requiring a tool to be done or undone (crimping, screwing, bonding, etc.). \\n     Furthermore, the fastening system must enable a regular, precise and immediate alignment of the decorative element of the leathercraft article. In other words, the user does not have to be concerned with alignment when fastening the decorative element in order that it is in the position prescribed by the manufacturer of the leathercraft article. \\n     To this end, the invention relates to a system for reversibly fastening a decorative lining on a surface of a leathercraft article made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, the system comprising:\\n         a male part constituted of a rigid brooch having decorative piercings and having a fastening face bearing:\\n           N fastening buttons, N being an integer greater than or equal to 1, each button comprising a shank and a free bulging end wider than the shank, and   at least one lug for translationally locking the decorative lining;   \\n           a female part comprising as many button holes as the male part comprises buttons, each button hole being designed, in use, to be fastened in a permanent manner on the surface made of flexible material and to maintain in a reversible manner the bulging end of a button;   the or each locking lug being intended to engage, in use, in an orifice cut into the decorative lining.       \\n\\n     According to the invention, the reversible fastening of the brooch on the leathercraft article and the translational locking of the decorative lining between the brooch and the leathercraft article are dissociated. This enables a very precise reversible fastening in position of the brooch on the leathercraft article, while facilitating the change of the lining which is simply arranged between the brooch and the leathercraft article. \\n     According to particular embodiments:\\n         the shank of each button may have a length such that, in position of use, when the free end of the or each button is engaged in the button hole(s), the decorative lining is compressed between the brooch and the surface of the leathercraft article;   the fastening system may comprise two fastening buttons each arranged near to two opposite ends of the brooch, and at least one translational locking lug arranged between the two fastening buttons;   the bulging end of the fastening buttons may be spherical and the female parts may be crimped in the leathercraft article in such a way that the fastening buttons and the button holes form press fasteners; and/or   each female part may be a casing fastened onto the surface of the leathercraft article, each casing comprising a fastening face provided with a button hole constituted of a hole of diameter at least equal to the diameter of the bulging end and an oblong notch emerging in the hole and of diameter greater than the diameter of the shank of each button and less than the diameter of the bulging end of each button.       \\n\\n     The invention also relates to a decorative element for a leathercraft article comprising a surface made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, the decorative element comprising a decorative lining and a preceding reversible fastening system. \\n     The invention also relates to a leathercraft article comprising a surface made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, a decorative lining and a preceding reversible fastening system. \\n     Advantageously, the leathercraft article may comprise, moreover, a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches bearing different decorative piercings. \\n     The invention also relates to a decorative kit for a leathercraft article comprising a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches for a preceding reversible fastening system and each bearing different decorative piercings. \\n     The invention also relates to a decorative lining intended to cooperate with a preceding reversible fastening system and comprising as many orifices as the male part of the fastening system comprises translational locking lugs, the orifices being arranged so as to receive, in use, the locking lug(s). \\n     Each orifice may either traverse right through the lining, or be blind and only traverse the lining over a part of its thickness. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n       Other characteristics of the invention will be set forth in the description detailed hereafter, made with reference to the appended drawings, which respectively represent: \\n         FIG. 1 , a schematic view in perspective of a leathercraft article provided with a first embodiment of a female part of the fastening system according to the invention; \\n         FIG. 2 , a schematic view in perspective of a decorative lining and of a first embodiment of the male part of the fastening system according to the invention before mounting; \\n         FIG. 3 , a schematic view in perspective of the lining and of the male part illustrated in  FIG. 2  assembled, before fastening to the female part of the leathercraft article of  FIG. 1 ; \\n         FIG. 4 , a schematic view in section of a first embodiment of locking lugs of a fastening system according to the invention; \\n         FIG. 5 , a schematic view in section of a second embodiment of locking lugs of a fastening system according to the invention; \\n         FIG. 6 , a schematic view in perspective of a second embodiment of a female part of the fastening system according to the invention; and \\n         FIG. 7 , a schematic view in perspective of a decorative lining and of a second embodiment of the male part of the fastening system according to the invention before mounting then fastening to the female part of the leathercraft article of  FIG. 6 . \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS \\n     The decorative element according to the invention is intended to be fastened on a leathercraft article M so as to be able to change decorative lining easily, without any tool, and in a precise manner. \\n       FIG. 1  illustrates, as an example, a pouch made of leather M, comprising two button holes  100  of press fasteners crimped in the flexible surface M 1  of the flap. \\n     Each button hole  100  is thus designed, in use, to be fastened in a permanent manner on the surface made of flexible material and to maintain in a reversible manner the remainder of the fastening system and the decorative lining illustrated in  FIGS. 2 and 3 . \\n       FIG. 2  illustrates a lining  200  and a first embodiment  300  of the male part of the fastening system according to the invention According to the invention, the male part  300  is constituted of a rigid brooch  301  having decorative piercings  302  and having a fastening face  303 . \\n     The latter bears as many fastening buttons as the female part comprises button holes. In the example illustrated, the fastening face  303  bears two buttons  304  each comprising a shank  304   a  and a free bulging end  304   b  wider than the shank  304   a . In this embodiment, the free bulging end  304   b  is spherical and constitutes the male part of a press fastener. \\n     Also according to the invention, the fastening face  303  bears, moreover, at least one lug  305  for translationally locking the decorative lining  200 . In the example illustrated, the two fastening buttons  304  are each arranged near to two opposite ends of the brooch  301 , and the lugs  305  for translationally locking are arranged between the two fastening buttons  304 . \\n     Advantageously, the locking lugs are arranged symmetrically so as to enable a positioning of the lining on its two faces, thus increasing the aesthetic possibilities if the two faces have different aspects. \\n     The decorative lining  200  comprises as many orifices  201  as the male part  300  of the fastening system comprises translational locking lugs  305 , the orifices being arranged so as to receive, in use, the locking lug (s)  305 . \\n     As illustrated in  FIG. 3 , the or each locking lug is intended to be engaged, in use, in an orifice  201  cut into the decorative lining  200 . \\n     During assembly, the user covers the decorative piercings  302  with the lining  200  and translationally locks it by inserting the locking lugs  305  in the orifices  201 . \\n     Advantageously, the lining has sufficient dimensions to be able to be flush with the shanks  304   a  of the button  304 . \\n     According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the shank  304   a  of each button  304  has a length L 1  (see  FIG. 4 ) such that in position of use, when the free bulging end  304   b  of the or each button  304  is engaged in the button hole(s)  100 , the decorative lining is compressed between the brooch  301  and the surface M 1  of the leathercraft article M. \\n     According to two variants illustrated in  FIGS. 4 and 5 , the orifices  201  may be either through orifice, or blind orifices. \\n     The lining  200  of the variant illustrated in  FIG. 4  comprises orifices  201  traversing right through the lining. \\n     Advantageously, the brooch  301  of the variant illustrated in  FIG. 4  comprises translational locking lugs  305  which have a length such that they slightly exceed the thickness of the lining  200 . Thus, in position of use, when the buttons  304  are engaged in the button holes  100  and retained by the reversible locking means  101  of the button hole (here a spring), the lugs  305  exert a local compression e 1  against the flexible surface M 1  of the article M. This ensures both an optimum translational locking of the lining  200 , while facilitating the removal of the brooch by spring effect. \\n     The lining  200 \u2032 of the variant illustrated in  FIG. 5  comprises blind orifices  201 \u2032, that is to say not traversing right through the lining but only a part of its thickness. \\n     This embodiment enables the translational locking of the lining while avoiding the rubbing of the lugs  305 \u2032 against the surface of the leathercraft article M. \\n     In a similar manner to the variant of  FIG. 4 , the length of the lug  305 \u2032 may be chosen slightly greater than the depth of the orifice  201 \u2032 when the decorative lining  200  is flexible (for example made of leather). Thus, in position of use, when the buttons  304  are engaged in the button holes  100  and retained by the reversible locking means  101  of the button hole, the lugs  305 \u2032 exert a local compression against the bottom of the orifice  201 \u2032 and, because the lining and the surface of the leathercraft article are flexible, against the flexible surface M 1  of the article M. This ensures both an optimum translational locking of the lining  200 , while facilitating the removal of the brooch by spring effect. \\n     The buttons  304  do not pin the decorative lining  200  onto the fastening face of the brooch because the buttons are not in contact with the decorative lining. Only the locking lugs  305  cooperate with the decorative lining, either in compression, or in abutment, in order to block the translational movement of the decorative lining. \\n     The fastening position of the brooch  301  is thus precise because it is determined by the cooperation of the buttons and the button holes. The locking of the lining may be a little less precise because the decorative piercings do not go beyond the lining  200 . It thus suffices to lock it translationally to prevent its edges appearing through the piercings  302  of the brooch  301 . \\n     This simple maintaining enables an easy replacement by the user who only has to separate the brooch  301  from the button holes  100  by simple traction, to remove the lining  200  from the lugs  305  and to replace it or to turn it over before repositioning everything. This removal may advantageously be facilitated by the spring effect created by the compression zones of the locking lugs. \\n     A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in  FIGS. 6 and 7 . \\n     In this second embodiment, each female part  400  is a casing  401  fastened on the surface of the leathercraft article by bonding, screwing or crimping. \\n     Each casing  401  comprises a fastening face  402  provided with a button hole  403  constituted of a hole  403   a  of diameter greater than the diameter of the bulging end  504   b  of the button  504  of the male part (see  FIG. 7 ) and of an oblong notch  403   b  emerging in the hole  403   a  and of diameter greater than the diameter of the shank  504   a  of each button  504  and less than the diameter of the bulging end  504   b  of each button  504 . \\n     In this embodiment, the user engages the bulging part of each button in the hole  403   a , then exerts a translational movement to make the shank slide into the notch. \\n     Advantageously the bulging part is substantially cylindrical and may have a chamfered shape to favour the pinning of the brooch against the leathercraft article when the shanks of the buttons are engaged in the oblong notches of the button holes. Alternatively, or in combination, the maintaining in position may be ensured by two magnets  404  arranged on either side of the button hole. \\n     The invention also relates to a leathercraft article comprising a surface made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, a decorative lining and a system for reversibly fastening the decorative lining such as described previously. Advantageously, the leathercraft article is supplied with a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches bearing different decorative piercings. \\n     The invention also pertains to a decorative kit for a leathercraft article comprising a fastening system such as described previously and a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches bearing different decorative piercings. \\n     Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of examples and that they should not be taken as limiting the invention as defined by the following claims. For example, notwithstanding the fact that the elements of a claim are set forth below in a certain combination, it must be expressly understood that the invention includes other combinations of fewer, more or different ones of the disclosed elements. \\n     The words used in this specification to describe the invention and its various embodiments are to be understood not only in the sense of their commonly defined meanings, but to include by special definition in this specification the generic structure, material or acts of which they represent a single species. \\n     The definitions of the words or elements of the following claims are, therefore, defined in this specification to not only include the combination of elements which are literally set forth. In this sense it is therefore contemplated that an equivalent substitution of two or more elements may be made for any one of the elements in the claims below or that a single element may be substituted for two or more elements in a claim. Although elements may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, it is to be expressly understood that one or more elements from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination and that the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination. \\n     Insubstantial changes from the claimed subject matter as viewed by a person with ordinary skill in the art, now known or later devised, are expressly contemplated as being equivalently within the scope of the claims. Therefore, obvious substitutions now or later known to one with ordinary skill in the art are defined to be within the scope of the defined elements. \\n     The claims are thus to be understood to include what is specifically illustrated and described above, what is conceptually equivalent, what can be obviously substituted and also what incorporates the essential idea of the invention.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

The dismantling and reassembly operation may be slow and delicate so as to conserve an impeccable aspect and a finish in order to justify the decorative function.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">It is then not possible to produce rapidly variants of the same decorative element, by changing the lining or the decorative metal sheet, whereas it is sought more and more to personalise fashion accessories to adapt them for example to the clothes worn, the types of activities planned, or to a need for frequent renewal so as not to repeat a same decoration.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">The objective of the present invention is notably to avoid these drawbacks of the prior art and to enable a reversible fastening of a decorative lining on a flexible surface of a leathercraft article.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">Reversible fastening is taken to mean a fastening that can be done and undone without a tool. On the contrary, permanent fastening is taken to mean a fastening requiring a tool to be done or undone (crimping, screwing, bonding, etc.).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">Furthermore, the fastening system must enable a regular, precise and immediate alignment of the decorative element of the leathercraft article. In other words, the user does not have to be concerned with alignment when fastening the decorative element in order that it is in the position prescribed by the manufacturer of the leathercraft article.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">To this end, the invention relates to a system for reversibly fastening a decorative lining on a surface of a leathercraft article made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, the system comprising:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0001-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0002-0001\" num=\"0015\">a male part constituted of a rigid brooch having decorative piercings and having a fastening face bearing:\\n        <ul> <li id=\"ul0003-0001\" num=\"0016\">N fastening buttons, N being an integer greater than or equal to 1, each button comprising a shank and a free bulging end wider than the shank, and</li> <li id=\"ul0003-0002\" num=\"0017\">at least one lug for translationally locking the decorative lining;</li> </ul>\\n        </li> <li id=\"ul0002-0002\" num=\"0018\">a female part comprising as many button holes as the male part comprises buttons, each button hole being designed, in use, to be fastened in a permanent manner on the surface made of flexible material and to maintain in a reversible manner the bulging end of a button;</li> <li id=\"ul0002-0003\" num=\"0019\">the or each locking lug being intended to engage, in use, in an orifice cut into the decorative lining.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\\n\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0020\">According to the invention, the reversible fastening of the brooch on the leathercraft article and the translational locking of the decorative lining between the brooch and the leathercraft article are dissociated. This enables a very precise reversible fastening in position of the brooch on the leathercraft article, while facilitating the change of the lining which is simply arranged between the brooch and the leathercraft article.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0021\">According to particular embodiments:\\n</p> <ul> <li id=\"ul0004-0001\" num=\"0000\"> <ul> <li id=\"ul0005-0001\" num=\"0022\">the shank of each button may have a length such that, in position of use, when the free end of the or each button is engaged in the button hole(s), the decorative lining is compressed between the brooch and the surface of the leathercraft article;</li> <li id=\"ul0005-0002\" num=\"0023\">the fastening system may comprise two fastening buttons each arranged near to two opposite ends of the brooch, and at least one translational locking lug arranged between the two fastening buttons;</li> <li id=\"ul0005-0003\" num=\"0024\">the bulging end of the fastening buttons may be spherical and the female parts may be crimped in the leathercraft article in such a way that the fastening buttons and the button holes form press fasteners;

In the example illustrated, the fastening face <b>303</b> bears two buttons <b>304</b> each comprising a shank <b>304</b> <i>a </i>and a free bulging end <b>304</b> <i>b </i>wider than the shank <b>304</b> <i>a</i>. In this embodiment, the free bulging end <b>304</b> <i>b </i>is spherical and constitutes the male part of a press fastener.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0037\" num=\"0045\">Also according to the invention, the fastening face <b>303</b> bears, moreover, at least one lug <b>305</b> for translationally locking the decorative lining <b>200</b>. In the example illustrated, the two fastening buttons <b>304</b> are each arranged near to two opposite ends of the brooch <b>301</b>, and the lugs <b>305</b> for translationally locking are arranged between the two fastening buttons <b>304</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0046\">Advantageously, the locking lugs are arranged symmetrically so as to enable a positioning of the lining on its two faces, thus increasing the aesthetic possibilities if the two faces have different aspects.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0047\">The decorative lining <b>200</b> comprises as many orifices <b>201</b> as the male part <b>300</b> of the fastening system comprises translational locking lugs <b>305</b>, the orifices being arranged so as to receive, in use, the locking lug (s) <b>305</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0048\">As illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the or each locking lug is intended to be engaged, in use, in an orifice <b>201</b> cut into the decorative lining <b>200</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0049\">During assembly, the user covers the decorative piercings <b>302</b> with the lining <b>200</b> and translationally locks it by inserting the locking lugs <b>305</b> in the orifices <b>201</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0050\">Advantageously, the lining has sufficient dimensions to be able to be flush with the shanks <b>304</b> <i>a </i>of the button <b>304</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0051\">According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the shank <b>304</b> <i>a </i>of each button <b>304</b> has a length L<b>1</b> (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>) such that in position of use, when the free bulging end <b>304</b> <i>b </i>of the or each button <b>304</b> is engaged in the button hole(s) <b>100</b>, the decorative lining is compressed between the brooch <b>301</b> and the surface M<b>1</b> of the leathercraft article M.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0052\">According to two variants illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the orifices <b>201</b> may be either through orifice, or blind orifices.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0045\" num=\"0053\">The lining <b>200</b> of the variant illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> comprises orifices <b>201</b> traversing right through the lining.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0054\">Advantageously, the brooch <b>301</b> of the variant illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> comprises translational locking lugs <b>305</b> which have a length such that they slightly exceed the thickness of the lining <b>200</b>. Thus, in position of use, when the buttons <b>304</b> are engaged in the button holes <b>100</b> and retained by the reversible locking means <b>101</b> of the button hole (here a spring), the lugs <b>305</b> exert a local compression e<b>1</b> against the flexible surface M<b>1</b> of the article M. This ensures both an optimum translational locking of the lining <b>200</b>, while facilitating the removal of the brooch by spring effect.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0047\" num=\"0055\">The lining <b>200</b>\u2032 of the variant illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> comprises blind orifices <b>201</b>\u2032, that is to say not traversing right through the lining but only a part of its thickness.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0056\">This embodiment enables the translational locking of the lining while avoiding the rubbing of the lugs <b>305</b>\u2032 against the surface of the leathercraft article M.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0057\">In a similar manner to the variant of <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref>, the length of the lug <b>305</b>\u2032 may be chosen slightly greater than the depth of the orifice <b>201</b>\u2032 when the decorative lining <b>200</b> is flexible (for example made of leather). Thus, in position of use, when the buttons <b>304</b> are engaged in the button holes <b>100</b> and retained by the reversible locking means <b>101</b> of the button hole, the lugs <b>305</b>\u2032 exert a local compression against the bottom of the orifice <b>201</b>\u2032 and, because the lining and the surface of the leathercraft article are flexible, against the flexible surface M<b>1</b> of the article M. This ensures both an optimum translational locking of the lining <b>200</b>, while facilitating the removal of the brooch by spring effect.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0058\">The buttons <b>304</b> do not pin the decorative lining <b>200</b> onto the fastening face of the brooch because the buttons are not in contact with the decorative lining. Only the locking lugs <b>305</b> cooperate with the decorative lining, either in compression, or in abutment, in order to block the translational movement of the decorative lining.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0059\">The fastening position of the brooch <b>301</b> is thus precise because it is determined by the cooperation of the buttons and the button holes. The locking of the lining may be a little less precise because the decorative piercings do not go beyond the lining <b>200</b>. It thus suffices to lock it translationally to prevent its edges appearing through the piercings <b>302</b> of the brooch <b>301</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0060\">This simple maintaining enables an easy replacement by the user who only has to separate the brooch <b>301</b> from the button holes <b>100</b> by simple traction, to remove the lining <b>200</b> from the lugs <b>305</b> and to replace it or to turn it over before repositioning everything. This removal may advantageously be facilitated by the spring effect created by the compression zones of the locking lugs.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0061\">A second embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0062\">In this second embodiment, each female part <b>400</b> is a casing <b>401</b> fastened on the surface of the leathercraft article by bonding, screwing or crimping.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0063\">Each casing <b>401</b> comprises a fastening face <b>402</b> provided with a button hole <b>403</b> constituted of a hole <b>403</b> <i>a </i>of diameter greater than the diameter of the bulging end <b>504</b> <i>b </i>of the button <b>504</b> of the male part (see <figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) and of an oblong notch <b>403</b> <i>b </i>emerging in the hole <b>403</b> <i>a </i>and of diameter greater than the diameter of the shank <b>504</b> <i>a </i>of each button <b>504</b> and less than the diameter of the bulging end <b>504</b> <i>b </i>of each button <b>504</b>.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0064\">In this embodiment, the user engages the bulging part of each button in the hole <b>403</b> <i>a</i>, then exerts a translational movement to make the shank slide into the notch.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0065\">Advantageously the bulging part is substantially cylindrical and may have a chamfered shape to favour the pinning of the brooch against the leathercraft article when the shanks of the buttons are engaged in the oblong notches of the button holes. Alternatively, or in combination, the maintaining in position may be ensured by two magnets <b>404</b> arranged on either side of the button hole.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0066\">The invention also relates to a leathercraft article comprising a surface made of flexible material such as leather, fabric or similar material, a decorative lining and a system for reversibly fastening the decorative lining such as described previously. Advantageously, the leathercraft article is supplied with a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches bearing different decorative piercings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0067\">The invention also pertains to a decorative kit for a leathercraft article comprising a fastening system such as described previously and a set of interchangeable decorative linings and/or a set of brooches bearing different decorative piercings.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0068\">Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, it must be understood that the illustrated embodiments have been set forth only for the purposes of examples and that they should not be taken as limiting the invention as defined by the following claims.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'TECHNICAL FIELD \\n     The present invention relates to the field of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, in particular to a compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal and a preparation method and application thereof. \\n     BACKGROUND ART \\n     Dairy cow mastitis, also known as bovine mastitis, is the most common disease of dairy cows, and it is mainly caused by chemical, physical, microbial and other stimulations and invasions to dairy cow breast, which lead to mechanical barrier of body and immune system abnormalities. Dairy cow mastitis not only produces some damage and influence on the cow body and mental state, but also reduces the milk production of dairy cows and the contents of lactoprotein, lactose and fat in milk. According to reports, the National Mastitis Council (U.S.) estimates that the loss caused by mastitis is 225 dollars/cow each year in United States, and 26.5% of dairy cows are eliminated because of mastitis. In Finland, Norway and Athens, dairy cows eliminated due to breast health problems account for 35%, 19% and 22%, respectively. In China, the reported positive rate of dairy cow mastitis is between 46.4% and 85.7%, and the positive rate in udder region is between 28% and 59%. Generally, incidence rate of subclinic mastitis reaches 20%-40% or more, even up to 50%-80%. In recent years, the incidence rate of dairy cow subclinic mastitis has been on the rise. The loss of milk production caused by dairy cow mastitis is about 3.8 million tons in the world each year. Whether or not pathogenic microorganisms can cause mastitis after invading the breast depends on the virulence of pathogens, and is also closely related with autoimmunity of the body. \\n     Melatonin (MT) is a neuroendocrine hormone produced by pineal glands of mammalians and human, and has good antioxidant and body immunity-modulating functions. Since 1980s when it was found that melatonin has modulatory effect on immune system, the influence of melatonin on the body immune function has attracted more and more attention. The white blood cell number, the percentage of lymphocytes and the phagocytic index of neutrophils in plasma of mice were decreased significantly by increased illumination, but after exogenous injection of melatonin, all of the white blood cell number, the percentage of lymphocytes and the phagocytic index of neutrophils were significantly increased. In rats which were exposed to continuous illumination and had pineal body removed, the number of neutrophils in serum was decreased, and the circadian rhythm of adhesion and phagocytosis disappeared. Melatonin also has important influence on humoral immunity in addition to the influence on cellular immune function of the body. In older mice injected with melatonin, the serum IgM and IgG were significantly increased compared to normal control group, thymus and spleen were significantly increased in weight, and the number and activity of T and B lymphocytes and NK cell were also enhanced accordingly. Application of the present invention can reduce the number of somatic cells of high-production dairy cows having the number of somatic cells from 300,000 to 1,000,000/mL by 50% or more, and the reduction is significantly higher than those caused by vitamin E, vitamin C, tea polyphenols (13.9%, L I U Shijun, et. al., 2010) and other biological antioxidant preparations. In this study, a compound antioxidant preparation consisting of melatonin and vitamin C (Vc) was applied to a research on enhancing body immunity of dairy cows, melatonin concentration in the body of dairy cows was increased by means of subcutaneous injection, influence of the compound antioxidant preparation on the number of somatic cells of normal dairy cows was studied, and body immunity was enhanced so as to achieve the purpose of reducing the number of somatic cells, improving health degree of dairy cows and improving milk quality. \\n     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n     An object of the present invention is to provide a compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal and its preparation method and application. \\n     To achieve the object of the present invention, the technical solution of the present invention is as follows: \\n     A compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal is in form of injection, and comprises melatonin and vitamin C as active components. \\n     Further, the concentration of the melatonin is 2 g/L-30 g/L. \\n     Preferably, the concentration of the melatonin is 2.32 g/L. \\n     Further, the concentration of the vitamin C is 1 g/L-14.3 g/L. \\n     Preferably, the concentration of the vitamin C is 8.8 g/L. \\n     Still further, adjuvant of the preparation is 75% ethanol solution. \\n     The present invention further provides a method of preparing the preparation, and the method comprises: dissolving vitamin C in 75% ethanol solution followed by addition of melatonin, wherein, the whole operation process needs to be carried out in a dark room (protected from light). \\n     The invention also provides the use of the preparation in improving the milk quality of a livestock animal. \\n     The livestock animal is a dairy cow, a dairy-beef dual-purpose cattle, or a dairy goat; preferably a dairy cow. \\n     In an embodiment of the present invention, Chinese Holstein cows are studied. \\n     The present invention has the following beneficial effects: \\n     In the present invention, it is found by animal experiments that the number of somatic cells in the sample of milk produced by Holstein cow is decreased by subcutaneously injecting 2 mL of the compound antioxidant preparation of the present invention at the neck of dairy cows for 4 days continuously, which provides beneficial reference for further study on decrease of the number of somatic cells of dairy cows by antioxidant preparation. \\n     The active components of the compound antioxidant preparation provided in the present invention are melatonin and vitamin C which are natural and innocuous, and thus there is no problem of residue of veterinary drugs, withdrawal period and withdrawal period for milk. This not only saves production cost, but also reduces the workload of cattle farm staff. \\n     When the number of somatic cells of dairy cow is higher than 100,000/ml, the number of somatic cells in milk can be significantly reduced by about 50% by using the compound antioxidant provided in the present invention, which fully demonstrates that the compound antioxidant preparation of the present invention can effectively decrease the number of somatic cells of dairy cow. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n       BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \\n         FIG. 1  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-6 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 2  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 6-16 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 3  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-6 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 300,000-500,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 4  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 6-16 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 300,000-500,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 5  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-16 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 100,000-200,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 6  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-16 days after injection of a compound antioxidant preparation into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 0-100,000/mL as described in experimental example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 7  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-16 days after subcutaneous injection of a preparation comprising vitamin C and vitamin E (Ve) into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL as described in comparative example 1 of the present invention. \\n         FIG. 8  shows a curve of the somatic cell count change in 1-16 days after subcutaneous injection of preparations of the present invention at different component ratios into dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL as described in comparative example 2 of the present invention. \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n     BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION \\n     The following examples are described for the purpose of illustrating the present invention rather than limiting the scope of the present invention. \\n     The reagents and materials used in the following examples are commercially available. \\n     Melatonin is needed to reach a purity of 99.9%. \\n     Example 1: Compound Antioxidant Preparation and its Preparation Method \\n     Raw Materials: Melatonin and Vitamin C \\n     Preparation method: 880 mg of vitamin C and 232 mg of melatonin were weighed accurately. The 880 mg of vitamin C was dissolved into 75% ethanol solution in a 100 ml volumetric flask, stirred to uniformity, then added with the 232 mg of melatonin, stirred to uniformity and diluted to 100 ml. Finally, the resulting solution was divided into injection doses of 2 ml. All of the operations were carried out in a dark room. \\n     Example 2: Compound Antioxidant Preparation and its Preparation Method \\n     Example 2 is the same as example 1 except that the concentration of melatonin is 2 g/L, and the concentration of vitamin C is 1 g/L. \\n     Example 3: Compound Antioxidant Preparation and its Preparation Method \\n     Example 3 is the same as example 1 except that the concentration of melatonin is 30 g/L, and the concentration of vitamin C is 14.3 g/L. \\n     Experimental Example 1: Application of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation in Decreasing Somatic Cell Count of Dairy Cow and Improving Milk Quality \\n     1. Raw Materials and Method \\n     1.1 Time and Location for Experiments \\n     From Sep. 1, 2013 to Sep. 30, 2013, in a cattle farm with a certain scale, Beijing \\n     1.2 Preparation and Usage of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation \\n     The concentrations of melatonin and vitamin C of the compound antioxidant preparation were 2-30 g/L and 1-14.3 g/L, respectively. Subcutaneous injection at the neck was adopted. \\n     1.3 Experimental Animals \\n     80 Holstein dairy cows with similar lactation days and milk production were chosen, and divided into 4 groups in terms of somatic cell count, i.e. 600,000-1,000,000/mL, 300,000-500,000/mL, 100,000-200,000/mL and 0-100,000/mL groups, each group including 20 dairy cows. All of feeding manner, milking manner and daily management for test cows run according to existing regulations in the cattle farm, i.e. free stall feeding, feeding total mixed rations, free drinking and milking three times in one day were adopted for all test cows. \\n     1.4 Experimental Design \\n     Only the milk obtained from the first milking was sampled every day. 2 ml of the compound antioxidant preparation was injected for 4 days continuously after sampling. At day 5, injection was stopped, and only milk sampling was performed. Milk sampling was continued in subsequent day 6, 8, 10, 13 and 16. \\n     1.5 Determination of Somatic Cell Count \\n     Each of the collected milk samples was added with three drops of saturated potassium dichromate solution, refrigerated at 4\u00b0 C. in a refrigerator, and then sent to National Dairy Herd Improvement Standard Substance Preparation Laboratory for determination of somatic cell count. \\n     1.6 Data Processing \\n     All experimental data were analyzed by SPSS software. \\n     2 Results and Analysis \\n     2.1 Influence on the Somatic Cell Count Change of Dairy Cows Having a Somatic Cell Count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL by Subcutaneous Injection of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation of Example 1 \\n     A curve of the somatic cell count change of dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL after injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is shown in  FIG. 1 . Somatic cells show a significantly decreasing trend from the day of injection on dairy cows. The decrease degree of the test group is significantly higher than that of the control group, and no increase occurred in the period of injection. The largest decrease is from 757,000/mL before injection to 215,000/mL. However, such decrease does not maintain for a long time, and the somatic cell count of dairy cows returns to an undulate law which is the same as that of the control group soon after the injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is stopped ( FIG. 2 ). \\n     2.2 Influence on the Somatic Cell Count Change of Dairy Cows Having a Somatic Cell Count of 300,000-500,000/mL by Subcutaneous Injection of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation of Example 1 \\n     A curve of the somatic cell count change of dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 300,000-500,000/mL after injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is shown in  FIG. 3 . The somatic cell count in dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 300,000-500,000/mL shows a continuously decreasing trend after continuous injection of the compound antioxidant preparation, which is in stark contrast to the increasing trend of the control group. The largest decrease is from 375,000/mL before injection to 147,000/mL. After the injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is stopped, the somatic cell count of test dairy cows increases slightly, and finally maintains at 200,000-300,000/mL for a long time. On the contrast, the somatic cell count of the dairy cows in the control group shows a decreasing trend at this time, and finally maintains at 300,000-400,000/mL. \\n     2.3 Influence on the Somatic Cell Count Change of Dairy Cows Having a Somatic Cell Count of 100,000-200,000 by Subcutaneous Injection of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation of Example 1 \\n     A curve of the somatic cell count change of dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 100,000-200,000/mL after injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is shown in  FIG. 5 . The somatic cell count shows a significantly decreasing trend after the dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 100,000-200,000 are injected with the compound antioxidant preparation. The somatic cell count decreases from 150,000/mL before injection to 60,000/mL after injection, and maintains at 50,000-100,000/mL after the injection is stopped. The somatic cell count of the dairy cows in the control group also shows a decreasing trend, but the decrease is slow; and the somatic cell count finally maintains at 100,000-150,000/mL. \\n     2.4 Influence on the Somatic Cell Count Change of Dairy Cows Having a Somatic Cell Count of 0-100,000/mL by Subcutaneous Injection of the Compound Antioxidant Preparation of Example 1 \\n     A curve of the somatic cell count change of dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 0-100,000/mL after injection of the compound antioxidant preparation is shown in  FIG. 6 . After injection of the compound antioxidant preparation, the somatic cell count of dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 0-100,000/mL shows a decreasing trend, but increases obviously after the injection is stopped, and finally maintains at 20,000-40,000/mL. The somatic cell count change of the dairy cows in the control group is relatively small, and maintains at 20,000-40,000/mL all through the experiment. \\n     3. Conclusion \\n     Exogenous injection of an antioxidant preparation can play the role of decreasing somatic cell count of dairy cows, and the role is particularly evident for dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 100,000/mL or more. The modulatory effect of melatonin on body immunity may be the cause of the decrease in somatic cell count of dairy cows. A somatic cell count of 500,000/mL is defined as the benchmark of (clinical) mastitis internationally. Pathogenic microorganisms will cause inflammation in dairy cows after breaking through the first line of defense, i.e. keratin. If neutrophils fail to enter the breast in time, dairy cows may suffer from mastitis. However, whether or not pathogenic microorganisms can cause mastitis after invasion to the breast depends on the virulence of pathogens, and is also closely related with the immunity of the body. Using surfactants, immunomodulators and microbial cell enzymes, Russian scholars developed biological agents, which can treat subclinic mastitis by improving the body immunity of dairy cows and achieve good effect. In recent studies, it has been found that melatonin can increase the weight of immune organs, increase the percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, promote the formation of antibodies and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, stimulate the production of cytokines, participate in the regulation of neuroendocrine-immune network, and plays an important role in mediating circadian rhythm of immune function. \\n     Comparative Example 1 \\n     1. Subcutaneous Injection of a Preparation (2 mL) Comprising Vitamin C and Vitamin E (Ve) \\n     20 Holstein dairy cows having similar lactation days and milk production and a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL were chosen, and divided into 2 groups randomly, i.e. 600,000-1,000,000/mL, each group including 10 dairy cows. All of feeding manner, milking manner and daily management for test cows run according to existing regulations in the cattle farm, i.e. free stall feeding, feeding total mixed rations, free drinking and milking three times in one day were adopted for all test cows. Only the milk obtained from the first milking was sampled every day. 2 ml of the preparation comprising vitamin C and vitamin E was injected for 4 days continuously after sampling. At day 5, injection was stopped, and only milk sampling was performed. And milk sampling was continued in subsequent day 6, 8, 10, 13 and 16. Each of the collected milk samples was added with three drops of saturated potassium dichromate solution, refrigerated at 4\u00b0 C. in a refrigerator, and then sent to National Dairy Herd Improvement Standard Substance Preparation Laboratory for determination of somatic cell count. \\n     2. Experimental Results \\n     After injection of the preparation comprising vitamin C and vitamin E, the somatic cell count of dairy cows decreases by about 15%, and the effect is evidently inferior to that of the preparation comprising melatonin and vitamin C. Furthermore, the effect does not maintain for a long time, and an undulate law the same as that of the control group occurs from the 4 th  day after injection is stopped ( FIG. 7 ). \\n     Comparative Example 2 \\n     1. Subcutaneous Injection of Preparations (2 mL) Comprising MT and Vc at Different Ratios \\n     40 Holstein dairy cows having similar lactation days and milk production and a somatic cell count of 600,000-1,000,000/mL were chosen, and divided into 5 groups randomly. Preparations at different ratios as described in the present invention, mainly including 5 kinds, i.e. MT(1 g/L)+Vc(0.5 g/L), MT(1 g/L)+Vc(1 g/L), MT(2.32 g/L)+Vc(8.8 g/L), MT(23.2 g/L)+Vc(14.3 g/L) and MT(50 g/L)+Vc(25 g/L), were injected for 4 days continuously. At day 5, injection was stopped, and only milk sampling was performed. And milk sampling was continued in subsequent day 6, 8, 10, 13 and 16. Each of the collected milk samples was added with three drops of saturated potassium dichromate solution, refrigerated at 4\u00b0 C. in a refrigerator, and then sent to National Dairy Herd Improvement Standard Substance Preparation Laboratory for determination of somatic cell count. \\n     2. Experimental Results \\n     All of the preparations at different ratios have the function of decreasing somatic cell count of dairy cows, but the effects are highly different. Preparations MT(1 g/L)+Vc(1 g/L), MT(2.32 g/L)+Vc(8.8 g/L) and MT(23.2 g/L)+Vc(14.3 g/L) are substantially consistent in effect, and play the function of significantly decreasing somatic cells of high-production dairy cows with a decrease of about 50%. Preparations MT(1 g/L)+Vc(0.5 g/L) and MT(50 g/L)+Vc(25 g/L) have poor effect in decreasing somatic cell count with a decrease of 5%-16%; and furthermore, the effect does not maintain for a long time, and an undulate law the same as that of the control group starts to occur when injection has been stopped for 4-6 days ( FIG. 8 ). \\n     Although the present invention has been described in detail through the general descriptions and detailed embodiments above, it is obvious to those skilled in the art to make modifications or improvements based on the present invention. Hence, the modifications or improvements which are made without departing from the spirits of the present invention fall into the protection scope claimed by the present invention. \\n     INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY \\n     The compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal disclosed by the present invention can improve milk quality of a livestock animal. By animal experiments, it is found that somatic cell count in the sample of milk produced by dairy cows is decreased by subcutaneously injecting 2 mL of the compound antioxidant preparation of the present invention at the neck of dairy cows for 4 days continuously, which provides beneficial reference for further study on decrease of somatic cell count of dairy cows by antioxidant preparation. The active components of the compound antioxidant preparation provided in the present invention are melatonin and vitamin C which are natural and innocuous, and thus there is no problem of residue of veterinary drugs, withdrawal period and withdrawal period for milk. This not only saves production cost, but also reduces the workload of cattle farm staff.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Dairy cow mastitis not only produces some damage and influence on the cow body and mental state, but also reduces the milk production of dairy cows and the contents of lactoprotein, lactose and fat in milk. According to reports, the National Mastitis Council (U.S.) estimates that the loss caused by mastitis is 225 dollars/cow each year in United States, and 26.5% of dairy cows are eliminated because of mastitis. In Finland, Norway and Athens, dairy cows eliminated due to breast health problems account for 35%, 19% and 22%, respectively. In China, the reported positive rate of dairy cow mastitis is between 46.4% and 85.7%, and the positive rate in udder region is between 28% and 59%. Generally, incidence rate of subclinic mastitis reaches 20%-40% or more, even up to 50%-80%. In recent years, the incidence rate of dairy cow subclinic mastitis has been on the rise. The loss of milk production caused by dairy cow mastitis is about 3.8 million tons in the world each year. Whether or not pathogenic microorganisms can cause mastitis after invading the breast depends on the virulence of pathogens, and is also closely related with autoimmunity of the body.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">Melatonin (MT) is a neuroendocrine hormone produced by pineal glands of mammalians and human, and has good antioxidant and body immunity-modulating functions. Since 1980s when it was found that melatonin has modulatory effect on immune system, the influence of melatonin on the body immune function has attracted more and more attention. The white blood cell number, the percentage of lymphocytes and the phagocytic index of neutrophils in plasma of mice were decreased significantly by increased illumination, but after exogenous injection of melatonin, all of the white blood cell number, the percentage of lymphocytes and the phagocytic index of neutrophils were significantly increased. In rats which were exposed to continuous illumination and had pineal body removed, the number of neutrophils in serum was decreased, and the circadian rhythm of adhesion and phagocytosis disappeared. Melatonin also has important influence on humoral immunity in addition to the influence on cellular immune function of the body. In older mice injected with melatonin, the serum IgM and IgG were significantly increased compared to normal control group, thymus and spleen were significantly increased in weight, and the number and activity of T and B lymphocytes and NK cell were also enhanced accordingly. Application of the present invention can reduce the number of somatic cells of high-production dairy cows having the number of somatic cells from 300,000 to 1,000,000/mL by 50% or more, and the reduction is significantly higher than those caused by vitamin E, vitamin C, tea polyphenols (13.9%, L I U Shijun, et. al., 2010) and other biological antioxidant preparations. In this study, a compound antioxidant preparation consisting of melatonin and vitamin C (Vc) was applied to a research on enhancing body immunity of dairy cows, melatonin concentration in the body of dairy cows was increased by means of subcutaneous injection, influence of the compound antioxidant preparation on the number of somatic cells of normal dairy cows was studied, and body immunity was enhanced so as to achieve the purpose of reducing the number of somatic cells, improving health degree of dairy cows and improving milk quality.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0003\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">An object of the present invention is to provide a compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal and its preparation method and application.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">To achieve the object of the present invention, the technical solution of the present invention is as follows:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0007\" num=\"0006\">A compound antioxidant preparation for reducing the number of somatic cells in a livestock animal is in form of injection, and comprises melatonin and vitamin C as active components.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0008\" num=\"0007\">Further, the concentration of the melatonin is 2 g/L-30 g/L.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0009\" num=\"0008\">Preferably, the concentration of the melatonin is 2.32 g/L.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0010\" num=\"0009\">Further, the concentration of the vitamin C is 1 g/L-14.3 g/L.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0011\" num=\"0010\">Preferably, the concentration of the vitamin C is 8.8 g/L.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0012\" num=\"0011\">Still further, adjuvant of the preparation is 75% ethanol solution.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0013\" num=\"0012\">The present invention further provides a method of preparing the preparation, and the method comprises: dissolving vitamin C in 75% ethanol solution followed by addition of melatonin, wherein, the whole operation process needs to be carried out in a dark room (protected from light).</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0014\" num=\"0013\">The invention also provides the use of the preparation in improving the milk quality of a livestock animal.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0015\" num=\"0014\">The livestock animal is a dairy cow, a dairy-beef dual-purpose cattle, or a dairy goat; preferably a dairy cow.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0016\" num=\"0015\">In an embodiment of the present invention, Chinese Holstein cows are studied.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0017\" num=\"0016\">The present invention has the following beneficial effects:</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0018\" num=\"0017\">In the present invention, it is found by animal experiments that the number of somatic cells in the sample of milk produced by Holstein cow is decreased by subcutaneously injecting 2 mL of the compound antioxidant preparation of the present invention at the neck of dairy cows for 4 days continuously, which provides beneficial reference for further study on decrease of the number of somatic cells of dairy cows by antioxidant preparation.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">The active components of the compound antioxidant preparation provided in the present invention are melatonin and vitamin C which are natural and innocuous, and thus there is no problem of residue of veterinary drugs, withdrawal period and withdrawal period for milk.

Conclusion</heading>\\n    <p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">Exogenous injection of an antioxidant preparation can play the role of decreasing somatic cell count of dairy cows, and the role is particularly evident for dairy cows having a somatic cell count of 100,000/mL or more. The modulatory effect of melatonin on body immunity may be the cause of the decrease in somatic cell count of dairy cows. A somatic cell count of 500,000/mL is defined as the benchmark of (clinical) mastitis internationally. Pathogenic microorganisms will cause inflammation in dairy cows after breaking through the first line of defense, i.e. keratin. If neutrophils fail to enter the breast in time, dairy cows may suffer from mastitis. However, whether or not pathogenic microorganisms can cause mastitis after invasion to the breast depends on the virulence of pathogens, and is also closely related with the immunity of the body. Using surfactants, immunomodulators and microbial cell enzymes, Russian scholars developed biological agents, which can treat subclinic mastitis by improving the body immunity of dairy cows and achieve good effect. In recent studies, it has been found that melatonin can increase the weight of immune organs, increase the percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, promote the formation of antibodies and proliferation of T and B lymphocytes, stimulate the production of cytokines, participate in the regulation of neuroendocrine-immune network, and plays an important role in mediating circadian rhythm of immune function.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0013\">Comparative Example 1</heading>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0014\">1.

            "description_localized": "[{'text': 'TECHNICAL FIELD \\n     The present invention relates to a so-called vane rotary-type gas compressor. \\n     BACKGROUND ART \\n     Conventionally, various gas compressors have been proposed as indicated in Patent Literature 1. \\n       FIG. 16  shows a compression block disposed in a gas compressor pertaining to Patent Literature 1. \\n     This compression block has a cylinder block  100  and a pair of side blocks  101  disposed on the left and right of the cylinder block  100 . A cylinder chamber  105  is formed in the cylinder block  100  and the pair of the side blocks  101 . The cylinder block  100  is provided with a suction port  110  and two discharge ports  108 . \\n     A rotor  102  is rotatably disposed in the cylinder chamber  105 . The rotor  102  is formed with a plurality of vane grooves  106  at intervals. A vane  103  is disposed in each vane groove  106  so as to freely retractable from an outer peripheral surface of the rotor  102 . A back pressure space  107  ( 107 A,  107 B and  107 C) is formed in the vane groove  106  on the back surface side of the vane  103 . The back pressure space  107  opens to both side surfaces of the rotor  102 . \\n     An intermediate-pressure supply groove  113  and a high-pressure supply groove  114  are formed in a wall surface on the cylinder chamber  105  side of each side block  101 , on a rotation locus of the back pressure space  107 . An intermediate pressure that is a pressure higher than that of a sucked refrigerant and is lower than that of the discharged refrigerant is supplied to the intermediate-pressure supply groove  113 . High pressure that is a pressure equivalent to that of the discharged refrigerant is supplied to the high-pressure supply groove  114 . \\n     Compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  are formed in the cylinder chamber  105  by being surrounded by the two vanes  103 . The compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  perform a suction process, a compression process and a discharged process and repeat this series of the processes, at the time of rotation of the rotor  102 . \\n     In the suction process, the refrigerant is sucked from the suction port  110  by gradual increase in volumes of the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c . In the compression process, the refrigerant is compressed by gradual decrease in volumes of the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c . In the discharged process, when the volumes of the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  are gradually decreased and a refrigerant pressure becomes at least a predetermined pressure, an open/close valve  109  opens and the refrigerant is discharged from the discharge port  108 . \\n     In such a series of processes, as to each of the vane  103 , although the refrigerant pressures in the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  press each of the vanes  103  in a direction (hereinafter, a \u201cstorage direction\u201d) in which each of the vane  103  is stored in the vane groove  106 , a tip of each of the vane  103  slides along an inner wall of the cylinder chamber  105  by a back pressure acting on the back pressure space  107  and thereby the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  are able to reliably compress the refrigerant. \\n     Here, in the suction process and in an early stage of the compression process in which pressure in the storage direction is small, an intermediate pressure from the intermediate-pressure supply groove  113  is made to act as the back pressure. In addition, in a later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process in which the pressure in the storage direction of the vane  103  is large, high pressure from the high-pressure supply groove  114  is made to act as the back pressure. In this way, a sliding resistance of the vane  103  is made as small as possible so as to achieve low fuel consumption by changing the back pressure made to act on the vane  103 , in accordance with the pressure in the storage direction of the vane  103 . \\n     CITATION LIST \\n     Patent Literature \\n     Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2013-194549 \\n     SUMMARY OF INVENTION \\n     Technical Problem \\n       FIG. 17  is a graph showing changes in a pressure P 105   a  in the compression chamber  105   a , a pressure P 105   b  in the compression chamber  105   b  and a pressure P 107 A in the back pressure space  107 A in accordance with a rotation angle of the rotor. As shown in  FIG. 17 , at an angle of 180 degrees, the back pressure space  107 A having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  113  communicates with the high-pressure supply groove  114 . \\n     In the example shown in  FIG. 16 , when the back pressure space  107 B shifts a communication state from the intermediate-pressure supply groove  113  to the high-pressure supply groove  114 , the preceding rotation downstream back pressure space  107 A is already in communication with the high-pressure supply groove  114 . Accordingly, when the following rotation upstream back pressure space  107 B completes shifting of the communication state to the high-pressure supply groove  114 , the two back pressure spaces  107 A and  107 B are simultaneously brought into a state of communicating with the high-pressure supply groove  114 . \\n     Since the pressure P 107 B in the rotation upstream back pressure space  107 B is intermediate pressure, the pressure P 107 A in the rotation downstream back pressure space  107 A that communicates with the rotation upstream back pressure space  107 B via the high-pressure supply groove  114  becomes temporarily lower than a pressure to be supplied to the high-pressure supply groove  114  as shown by P in  FIG. 17 . Since, in the vane  103  on the rotation downstream side, the pressures of the refrigerant in the compression chambers  105   a ,  105   b  and  105   c  which are in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process act in the storage direction of the vane  103 , there is a possibility that the vane  103  may be temporarily stored in the vane groove  106  and chattering may occur. \\n     The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances and an object of the present invention is to prevent occurrence of chattering of the vane by a temporary reduction in pressure in the back pressure space of the vane, for example, in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process, and to maintain operating performance as a gas compressor. \\n     Solution to Problem \\n     In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, a gas compressor of the present invention includes: \\n     a tubular cylinder block having therein a cylinder chamber in which a refrigerant is compressed; \\n     side blocks that are attached to side parts of the cylinder block and seal an opening of the cylinder chamber on the side parts; \\n     a rotor that rotates in the cylinder chamber and has a plurality of vane grooves opening to an outer peripheral surface facing an inner peripheral surface of the cylinder chamber at intervals in a rotation direction; \\n     a plurality of vanes that is respectively stored in the respective vane grooves, protrudes and retracts from the outer peripheral surface, comes into sliding contact with the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder chamber, and partitions a space between the inner peripheral surface and the outer peripheral surface of the rotor into a plurality of compression chambers; \\n     an intermediate-pressure supply section that is formed in at least one of the side blocks, communicates with a back pressure space at a groove bottom of each of the vane grooves storing the vanes for partitioning the compression chambers from a suction process to a compression process, and supplies, to the back pressure space, an intermediate pressure larger than a refrigerant pressure in each of the compression chambers from the suction process to the compression process; and \\n     a high-pressure supply section that is formed in at least one of the side blocks, communicates with the back pressure space in each of the vane grooves storing the vanes for partitioning the compression chambers from the compression process to a discharged process after communication with the intermediate-pressure supply section has been completed, and supplies, to the back pressure space, high pressure larger than the refrigerant pressure in each of the compression chambers from the compression process to the discharged process and larger than the intermediate pressure, wherein \\n     the high-pressure supply section is divided into a plurality of mutually independent supply sections in the rotation direction, \\n     the second supply section that is positioned at least secondarily from the most upstream side in the rotation direction is

back pressure space of the one vane groove and the back pressure space of the other vane groove adjacent to the vane groove on the upstream side in the rotation direction. \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n

of the present invention will be described with reference to  FIG. 1  to  FIG. 8 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 1 , a gas compressor  1  according to the present embodiment includes a substantially cylindrical housing  2 , a compression section  3  stored in the housing  2 , a motor section  4  that transmits driving force to the compression section  3  and an inverter section  5  which is fixed to the housing  2  and which controls driving of the motor section  4 . \\n     The housing  2  is configured by a front head  7  in which a not shown suction port is formed and a bottomed cylindrical rear case  9  whose opening is closed by the front head  7 . \\n     The compression section  3  is fixed to an inner wall  13  of the rear case  9 . The compression section  3  is formed with a suction chamber  11  on one side and is formed with a discharge chamber  15  on the other side so as to partition the inside of the housing  2 . In addition, a not shown discharge port which communicates the discharge chamber  15  with a refrigerating cycle is formed in an outer periphery of the rear case  9 . Additionally, an oil sump  17  which stores an oil O for maintaining lubricity of the compression section  3  is formed under the discharge chamber  15 . \\n     The compression section  3  includes a compression block  19  that forms a cylinder chamber  33 , an oil separator  21  fixed to the compression block  19 , a rotor  23  that is rotatably stored in the cylinder chamber  33 , a vane  25  (refer to  FIG. 3 ) that protrudes and retracts from the rotor  23  to partition the cylinder chamber  33 , and a drive shaft  27  that is fixed integrally with the rotor  23  to transmit the driving force thereto. \\n     The compression block  19  is configured by a cylinder block  29 , a pair of side blocks  31 , and the cylinder chamber  33  formed on an inner periphery of the cylinder block  29 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 3 , the cylinder block  29  has the distorted elliptical cylinder chamber  33  therein. An opening of this cylinder chamber  33  is closed by holding both ends of the cylinder block  29  by the pair of the side blocks  31 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4 , the rotor  23  is disposed such that one place is in contact with an inner wall of the cylinder chamber  33 , is disposed with a position displaced from the center (the center of gravity) of the cylinder chamber  33  being set as the center of rotation, and is provided with a vane groove  75  that opens to an outer peripheral surface of the rotor  23 , and a back pressure space  77  on the back surface side of the vane  25 . \\n     The cylinder chamber  33  is partitioned into a plurality of pieces in a rotation direction X of the rotor  23  by the plurality of vanes  25  that protrudes and retracts from the plurality of vane grooves  75  in the rotor  23 . Thereby, a plurality of compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  is formed between an inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  and an outer peripheral surface  23   a  of the rotor  23 . \\n     In addition, the cylinder block  29  is provided with a suction slot  39  through which the refrigerant is sucked into the cylinder chamber  33 , a discharge slot  35  through which the refrigerant having been compressed in the cylinder chamber  33  is discharged, an open/close valve  37  which opens/closes the discharge slot  35  and a cylinder-side oil supply path  41  which communicates with an oil supply path of the side block  31 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 1 , the pair of the side blocks  31  are configured by a front-side block  31   a  and a rear-side block  31   b  and the oil separator  21  is fixed to the rear-side block  31   b.    \\n     The front-side block  31   a  is provided with a front-side end surface  43  that abuts on the cylinder block  29 , a not shown suction slot that communicates with the suction slot  39  and sucks the refrigerant from the suction chamber  11 , a front-side bearing  47  that rotatably supports the drive shaft  27  and a front-side oil supply path  49  that communicates with the cylinder-side oil supply path  41 . \\n     The front-side end surface  43  is provided with a pressure supply groove, and the pressure supply groove includes an intermediate-pressure supply groove  51  that supplies, to the back pressure space  77 , an intermediate pressure (a middle pressure) higher than that of the sucked refrigerant and lower than that of the discharged refrigerant and a high-pressure supply groove  53  that is provided at a position facing a high-pressure supply groove  69  on the rear-side block  31   b  side. \\n     In addition, the front-side bearing  47  is formed with an annular front-side annular groove  55 , which is provided in communication with the one-end side of the front-side oil supply path  49 . Note that the other-end side of the front-side oil supply path  49  is in communication with the cylinder-side oil supply path  41 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 2 , the rear-side block  31   b  includes a rear-side end surface  57  that abuts on the cylinder block  29 , an oil supply hole  59  through which the oil O stored under the discharge chamber  15  is sucked, a rear-side bearing  63  that rotatably supports the drive shaft  27 , and a rear-side oil supply path  59   b  that communicates with the cylinder-side oil supply path  41 . \\n     The rear-side end surface  57  includes a discharge hole  61  through which the refrigerant having been compressed in the cylinder chamber  33  is discharged, an intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  (corresponding to an intermediate-pressure supply section in the claims) which supplies, to the back pressure space  77 , the oil of intermediate pressure higher than pressure (suction pressure) of the sucked refrigerant and lower than pressure (discharged pressure) of the discharged refrigerant, and the high-pressure supply groove  69  (corresponding to a high-pressure supply section in the claims) which supplies, to the back pressure space  77 , the oil of high pressure that is the pressure (the discharge pressure) of the discharged refrigerant. \\n     The high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into mutually independent first supply section  69   a  (corresponding to an upstream-side supply section) and second supply section  69   b  (corresponding to a downstream-side supply section) in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     In addition, high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b  respectively open to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , and the respective high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b  are in communication with a rear-side annular groove  73  on their one-end sides and are in communication with the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , respectively, on their other-end sides. \\n     Note that the high-pressure supply groove  53  of the front-side block  31   a  facing the high-pressure supply groove  69  is also divided into two supply sections (not shown) which are similar to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     The back pressure space  77  (refer to  FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4 ) formed in the rotor  23  communicates with the intermediate-pressure supply grooves  51  and  67  at a compression first-half position and communicates with the high-pressure supply grooves  53  and  69  at a compression later-half position, by rotation of the rotor  23 . \\n     In a state shown in  FIG. 4 , a back pressure space  77 B of the vane groove  75  in a vane  25 B which partitions the compression chamber  33   b  having moved from a suction process to a compression process and the compression chamber  33   a  that is positioned on the downstream side of the compression chamber  33   b  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  and has moved from the compression process to a discharged process by rotation of the rotor  23  terminates communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67 . Then, the back pressure space  77 B is about to communicate with the first supply section  69   a  that is positioned on the upstream side of the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 , from now on. \\n     In this state, a back pressure space  77 A of the vane groove  75  in a vane  25 A that precedes the vane  25 B in the downstream side of the vane  25 B in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  has already completed communication with the first supply section  69   a  and is in communication with the second supply section  69   b  positioned on the downstream side in the rotation direction X. \\n     In addition, in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 , the first supply section  69   a  is formed into a shape in which the back pressure space  77 A of the preceding vane  25 A and the back pressure space  77 B of the next vane  25 B that follows the vane  25 A do not communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. Namely, in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 , the first supply section is formed such that an angle range in which the first supply section  69   a  extends becomes smaller than a difference between the angle at which the back pressure space  77 A is positioned and the angle at which the back pressure space  77 B is positioned. In short, a distance between the back pressure space  77 A and the back pressure space  77 B in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  is set larger than a width of the first supply section  69   a.    \\n     In a similar way, in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 , the second supply section  69   b  is formed into a shape in which the back pressure space  77 A of the preceding vane  25 A and the back pressure space  77 B of the next vane  25 B that follows the vane  25 A do not communicate with the second supply section  69   b  simultaneously. Namely, in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 , the second supply section is formed such that an angle range in which the second supply section  69   b  extends becomes smaller than the difference between the angle at which the back pressure space  77 A is positioned and the angle at which the back pressure space  77 B is positioned. In short, the distance between the back pressure space  77 A and the back pressure space  77 B in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  is set larger than a width of the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     As described above, restrictions are caused on the angle range in which the first supply section  69   a  extends and the angle range in which the second supply section  69   b  extends, on the basis of the difference between the angle at which the back pressure space  77 A is positioned and the angle at which the back pressure space  77 B is positioned. \\n     Similarly, restrictions are caused on the angle range in which the first supply section  69   a  extends and the angle range in which the second supply section  69   b  extends, on the basis of a difference between the angle at which the back pressure space  77 B is positioned and an angle at which a back pressure space  77 C is positioned. \\n     Likewise, restrictions are caused on the angle range in which the first supply section  69   a  extends and the angle range in which the second supply section  69   b  extends, on the basis of a difference between the angle at which the back pressure space  77 C is positioned and the angle at which the back pressure space  77 A is positioned. \\n     In this way, the shapes of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  are determined on the basis of the angle at which the back pressure space  77  is positioned in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     Note that a distance between the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  and the first supply section  69   a  and a distance between the second supply section  69   b  and the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  are set larger than a width of the back pressure space  77  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     As shown in  FIG. 1 , the oil supply hole  59  is formed in communication with a rear-side oil supply path  59   a , and the rear-side oil supply path  59   b  is formed by branching from the rear-side oil supply path  59   a . The rear-side oil supply path  59   b  is in communication with the cylinder-side oil supply path  41 . \\n     The rear-side bearing  63  is formed with the annular rear-side annular groove  73 , which is in communication with a rear-side communication path  65 . The rear-side communication path  65  is in communication with the rear-side annular groove  73  on its one-end side and opens to the high-pressure supply groove  69  on its other-end side. \\n     The oil separator  21  is fixed to the rear-side block  31   b , the refrigerant having been compressed in the cylinder chamber  33  flows into the oil separator  21 , and the refrigerant and the oil O are separated from each other therein. \\n     The drive shaft  27  is fixed to the rotor  23  on its one side and is rotatably supported by the bearings  47  and  63  of the respective side blocks  31   a  and  31   b . In addition, the motor section  4  is fixed to the other side of the drive shaft  27 . \\n     The motor section  4  includes a stator  79  fixed to the inner wall  13  of the rear case  9  and a motor rotor  81  that is rotatably disposed on the inner periphery side of the stator  79  and rotates by a magnetic force. The motor rotor  81  transmits a rotational drive force to the compression section  3 , due to the rotation by the magnetic force. \\n     Here, there will be described an interval between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     In the present embodiment, as shown in  FIG. 3  and  FIG. 4 , the distance between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  is set narrower than the width of the back pressure space  77  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     Here, as shown in  FIG. 5 , it is assumed that the interval between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  is wider than the width of the back pressure space  77 .  FIG. 5  is an explanatory diagram showing a virtual example of a case where the first supply section and the second supply section of the high-pressure supply groove in  FIG. 3  are separately disposed at an interval at which the back pressure space of the vane groove does not communicate with any of them. \\n       FIG. 6  is a graph showing changes in a pressure P 33   a  in the compression chamber  33   a , a pressure P 33   b  in the compression chamber  33   b  and a pressure P 77 B of the back pressure space  77 B, in accordance with a rotation angle of the rotor. As shown in  FIG. 6 , at an angle of 180 degrees, the back pressure space  77 B having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the high-pressure supply groove  69 . In the present embodiment, the high-pressure supply groove  69  is constituted by the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , and the back pressure space  77 B communicates with the first supply section  69   a  and thereafter communicates with the second supply section  69   b , along with rotation of the rotor  23  that rotates in the rotation direction X. \\n     Since the interval between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  is larger than the width of the back pressure space  77 B, there is generated a state where the back pressure space  77 B does not communicate with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  when a communication destination of the back pressure space  77 B shifts from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     At this time, the vane  25 B stored in the vane groove  75 , the back pressure space  77 B of which is positioned between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , receives force acting in a direction of intruding into the vane groove  75  from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  since the compression chambers  33   a  and  33   b  partitioned by the vane  25 B stay from the later stage of the compression process to the discharged process. Namely, when the back pressure space  77 B is positioned between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , the volume of the back pressure space  77 B is in a state of being reduced. \\n     However, since the back pressure space  77 B does not communicate with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  at this position, it is not possible to release the high pressure of the amount corresponding to the reduced volume of the back pressure space  77 B to any place other than the back pressure space  77 B. Accordingly, in the middle stage of shifting the communication destination of the back pressure space  77 B from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b , the pressure in the back pressure space  77  temporarily rises as shown by P 1  in  FIG. 6 . Namely, since there is generated a state where the back pressure space  77 B is not in a communication state with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , the pressure in the back pressure space  77  temporarily rises as shown by P 1  in  FIG. 6 . \\n     When such a pressure rise in the back pressure space  77 B is generated, the vane  25 B which is receiving force of the direction of intruding into the vane groove  75  from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  attempts to project from the vane groove  75  by the risen pressure in the back pressure space  77 B. Then, there is a possibility that pressing force of the vane  25 B against the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased more than necessary and the sliding resistance between the vane  25 B and the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased. \\n     The similar phenomenon to the above can be generated in a state where the vane  25 A and a vane  25 C are not in communication with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     Accordingly, in the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment, as shown in  FIG. 7 , when the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  is shifted from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b , there is ensured, by a fixed amount or more, a cross-sectional area obtained by summing up a communication cross-sectional area Si between the back pressure space  77  and the first supply section  69   a  and a communication cross-sectional area S 3  between the back pressure space  77  and the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     Specifically, when the back pressure space  77  is in communication with the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , it is possible to release the high pressure in the back pressure space  77  to the high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b  through which the high pressure oil O is supplied to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , and the rear-side communication path  65  continued to the high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b , the rear-side annular groove  73 , the rear-side oil supply path  59   a , and the oil supply hole  59 . \\n     In order to ensure a high-pressure release route which is equal to or better than the above, in the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment, an interval at which the total of the above-mentioned communication cross-sectional areas Si and S 3  becomes at least a minimum path cross-sectional area in a high-pressure oil O supply route for the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , from the high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b  down to the oil supply hole  59 , is provided between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     Next, an operation of the gas compressor  1  according to the present embodiment will be described. \\n     First, an electric current flows through a coil having been wound on the stator  79  of the motor section  4  by control of the inverter section  5  shown in  FIG. 1 . Magnetic force is generated by electric current flowing through the coil, and the motor rotor  81  disposed on the inner periphery of the stator  79  rotates. \\n     The drive shaft  27  on the one-end side of which the motor rotor  81  is fixed rotates by rotation of the motor rotor  81 , and also the rotor  23  which is fixed on the other-end side of the drive shaft  27  rotates. \\n     The refrigerant flows into the suction chamber  11  together with rotation of the rotor  23 , and the refrigerant is sucked into the cylinder chamber  33  from the suction chamber  11  via a suction slot (not shown) of the front-side block  31   a  (the suction process). The refrigerant having been sucked into the cylinder chamber  33  enters the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  formed in the cylinder chamber  33  by the plurality of vanes  25 , and thereby the refrigerant in the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  is compressed by rotation of the rotor  23  (the compression process). \\n     The refrigerant having been compressed in the cylinder chamber  33  pushes the open/close valve  37  open, and is discharged from the discharge slot  35  (the discharged process) and is discharged from the discharge hole  61  into the discharge chamber  15  via the oil separator  21 . In addition, the refrigerant having been discharged from the discharge hole  61  is separated into the refrigerant and the oil O by the oil separator  21 , the refrigerant is discharged from a not shown discharge port to the not shown refrigerating cycle, and the oil O is stored under the discharge chamber  15 . \\n     The oil having been stored under the discharge chamber  15  is supplied from the oil supply hole  59  in the rear-side block  31   b  to the rear-side bearing  63  through the rear-side oil supply path  59   a.    \\n     The high-pressure oil having been supplied to the rear-side bearing  63  is reduced to intermediate pressure higher than the pressure (the suction pressure) of the sucked refrigerant and lower than the pressure (the discharged pressure) of the discharged refrigerant, by being squeezed between the rear-side bearing  63  and the drive shaft  27 , and the oil O having been reduced to the intermediate pressure is supplied to the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  through a gap between the drive shaft  27  and the rear-side block  31   b.    \\n     The intermediate pressure oil O having been supplied to the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  supplies the intermediate pressure to the back pressure space  77  and supplies the intermediate pressure to the back surface of the vane  25  such that the vane  25  projects from the vane groove  75 , over a range from the refrigerant suction process to the compression process as shown in  FIG. 3 . \\n     In addition, the high-pressure oil O having been supplied to the rear-side bearing  63  is supplied from the high-pressure supply paths  71   a  and  71   b  opening to the rear-side end surface  57  to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , via the rear-side communication path  65 . \\n     The high-pressure oil O having been supplied to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  supplies the high pressure to the back pressure space  77  and supplies the high pressure to the back surface of the vane  25  such that the vane  25  projects from the vane groove  75 , over a range from the refrigerant compression process to the discharged process as shown in  FIG. 3 . In addition, the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  communicate with the not shown respective corresponding supply sections of the high-pressure supply groove  53  on the front-side block  31   a  side via the back pressure space  77 , and the high pressure is also supplied from each of the supply sections of the high-pressure supply groove  53  to the back pressure space  77 . \\n     Furthermore, the high-pressure oil O flows into the rear-side oil supply path  59   a  from the oil supply hole  59 , passes through the rear-side oil supply path  59   b  by being branched from the rear-side oil supply path  59   a , and is supplied from the front-side oil supply path  49  to the front-side bearing  47  via the cylinder-side oil supply path  41 . \\n     The high-pressure oil O having been supplied to the front-side bearing  47  has intermediate pressure by being squeezed between the front-side bearing  47  and the drive shaft  27 , and the oil O having been reduced to the intermediate pressure is supplied to the intermediate-pressure supply groove  51  through the gap between the drive shaft  27  and the front-side block  31   a.    \\n     The high-pressure oil O having been supplied from the high-pressure supply grooves  53  and  69  of the front-side block  31   a  and the rear-side block  31   b  is supplied to the back pressure space  77  of the rotor  23  at a rotation latter-half position of the rotor  23  to impart the back pressure for making the vane  25  project from the vane groove  75 . \\n     According to the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment, the back pressure space  77  of the vane groove  75  having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , and the high pressure is supplied from the first supply section  69   a  thereto. \\n     Thereafter, this back pressure space  77  completes communication with the first supply section  69   a  before the back pressure space  77  of the next vane groove  75  that is positioned on the upstream side of the rotation direction X communicates with the first supply section  69   a  and communicates with the second supply section  69   b  that is independent of the first supply section  69   a  and is positioned on the downstream side of the rotation direction X, and thus the high pressure is again supplied to the back pressure space. \\n     Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space  77  having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , the preceding back pressure space  77  adjacent to the back pressure space  77  on the downstream side in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. \\n     In  FIG. 4 , there is shown a situation in which the back pressure space  77 A completes communication with the first supply section  69   a  before the back pressure space  77 B of the next vane groove  75  that is positioned on the upstream side in the rotation direction X communicates with the first supply section  69   a  and communicates with the second supply section  69   b  that is independent of the first supply section  69   a  and is positioned on the downstream side in the rotation direction X, and thus the high pressure is again supplied to the back pressure space  77 A. \\n     Accordingly, the preceding back pressure space  77 A adjacent to the back pressure space  77 B on the downstream side in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously at a time point when the back pressure space  77 B communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 . The similar relation is established not only between the back pressure space  77 A and the back pressure space  77 B, but also between the back pressure space  77 B and the back pressure space  77 C, and between the back pressure space  77 C and the backpressure space  77 A. \\n     It is possible to prevent the pressure in the preceding back pressure space  77  from being temporarily lowered from the high pressure by the intermediate pressure before the following next back pressure space  77  rises to the high pressure, by allowing the two back pressure spaces  77  not to communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of chattering in which the vane  25  repeats contact with and separation from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33 , by a temporary reduction of pressure in the back pressure space  77  of the vane  25  in the early stage of the compression process. \\n     Furthermore, the back pressure space  77  completes communication with the second supply section  69   b  before the back pressure space  77  of the next vane groove  75  which is positioned on the upstream side in the rotation direction X communicates with the second supply section  69   b . Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space  77  having completed communication with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  communicates with the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , the preceding back pressure space  77  adjacent to the downstream side of the back pressure space  77  in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the second supply section  69   b  simultaneously. \\n       FIG. 8  is a graph showing changes in the pressure P 33   a  of the compression chamber  33   a , the pressure P 33   b  of the compression chamber  33   b  and the pressure P 77 B of the back pressure space  77 B in accordance with the rotation angle of the rotor. As shown in  FIG. 8 , at the angle of 180 degrees, the back pressure space  77 B having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the high-pressure supply groove  69 . In the present embodiment, the high-pressure supply groove  69  is constituted by the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  and the back pressure space  77 B communicates with the first supply section  69   a  and thereafter communicates with the second supply section  69   b , along with rotation of the rotor  23  that rotates in the rotation direction X. \\n     As shown by P in the graph in  FIG. 17 , there occurred a phenomenon in which the pressure in the preceding back pressure space  107  is temporarily lowered from the high pressure, by a pressure which is in the middle of rising from the intermediate pressure of the following next back pressure space  107  to the high pressure. However, it is possible to prevent occurrence of the phenomenon as shown in the graph in  FIG. 8  by making the two back pressure spaces  77  not simultaneously communicate with the second supply section  69   b . Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of chattering in which the vane  25  repeats contact with and separation from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  by a temporary reduction of pressure in the back pressure space  77  of the vane  25  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process. \\n     Furthermore, according to the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment, the total of the communication cross-sectional areas Si and S 3  of the back pressure space  77  with the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  when the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  shifts from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b  is set to be a minimum path cross-sectional area or more of the supply route of the high-pressure oil O to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     In the middle stage of shifting the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b , the back pressure space  77  communicates, in the minimum path cross-sectional area or more, with at least one of the first supply section  69   a  or the second supply section  69   b , and thus there can be ensured a destination to which the high pressure in the back pressure space  77  is released. \\n     Accordingly, it is possible to prevent, as shown in the graph in  FIG. 8  by the above-mentioned configuration, such a phenomenon as indicated by P 1  in the graph in  FIG. 6 , namely, the phenomenon in which, in shifting the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b , the pressure in the back pressure space  77  temporarily rises by a shortage of the cross-sectional area of a route along which the high pressure in the back pressure space  77  is released. \\n     Thereby, there is prevented a phenomenon in which the pressing force of the vane  25  against the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  is increased more than necessary by a temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  and thus the sliding resistance between the both is increased. Therefore, it is possible to prevent increase in the sliding resistance of the vane  25  to the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  due to increase in the power required for rotation of the rotor  23  by the temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process, thereby being able to maintain the operating performance as the gas compressor  1 . \\n     Note that it is desirable that the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  be formed into a shape of the largest possible size in the rotation direction X within a range in which the two back pressure spaces  77  mutually adjacent in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  do not simultaneously communicate with each other. Consequently, it is possible to allow the back pressure space  77  in which pressure has been increased from the intermediate pressure toward the high pressure due to communication with the first supply section  69   a  to communicate with the second supply section  69   b  from an earlier stage of the compression process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c , and thereafter to stabilize the pressure in the back pressure space  77  to the high pressure. \\n     Accordingly, it is possible to start the discharged process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  at an earlier stage, the open/close valve  37  of the discharge slot  35  is opened at an earlier stage and the high-pressure refrigerant in the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  is efficiently and sufficiently discharged, and thereby it is possible to achieve enhancement of refrigerant compression efficiency. \\n     In the present embodiment, it was assumed that the high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into the two mutually independent first supply section  69   a  and second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X. However, the present invention is applicable also in a case where the high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into three or more supply sections in the rotation direction X. In that case, the relation of the present invention is applied to the communication cross-sectional area of an upstream-side supply section or a downstream-side supply section with the back pressure space  77  when the back pressure space  77  moves striding over the two adjacent supply sections in the rotation direction X. \\n     Second Embodiment \\n     Next, the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to  FIG. 9  to  FIG. 15 . \\n       FIG. 9  and  FIG. 10  show a structure of a vane rotary-type gas compressor according to the second embodiment. The gas compressor of the second embodiment has a rear-side block  31   b   2  different from the rear-side block  31   b  of the first embodiment. Configurations other than the rear-side block  31   b   2  are the configurations that are similar to those of the first embodiment. The same symbols are attached to the same constituent points as those in the first embodiment, a description thereof is omitted and only different configurations will be described. \\n     In the present embodiment, an interval  69   c  having a size that is not less than that of the back pressure space  77  of the vane groove  75  is provided between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . Namely, the interval  69   c  provided between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  is set larger than the width of the back pressure space  77  of the vane groove  75 . \\n     In a state shown in  FIG. 11 , the back pressure space  77 B of the vane groove  75  in the vane  25 B which partitions the compression chamber  33   b  having moved from the suction process to the compression process by rotation of the rotor  23  and the compression chamber  33   a  which is positioned on the downstream side of the compression chamber  33   b  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  and which has moved from the compression process to the discharged process communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 . \\n     In this state, the back pressure space  77 A of the vane groove  75  in the vane  25 A that precedes the vane  25 B in the downstream side of the vane  25 B in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  has already completed communication with the second supply section  69   b  and starts to communicate with the intermediate-pressure supply section  67  that is positioned on the downstream side of the rotation direction X. \\n     Here, there will be described the position of the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . When the rotor  23  rotates in the rotation direction X after the state shown in  FIG. 11 , the back pressure space  77 B completes communication with the first supply section  69   a  and the back pressure space  77 B communicates with the interval  69   c  provided between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b . At this time, there is generated a state where the back pressure space  77 B is not in communication with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b.    \\n     In this state, when the projection stroke of the vane  25 B relative to the vane groove  75  is reduced along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X, the volume of the back pressure space  77 B is reduced. At this time, since the back pressure space  77 B is not in communication with any of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , it is not possible to release the high pressure of the amount corresponding to the reduced volume to them. \\n     Accordingly, there is assumed a case where, when the vane  25 B is in sliding contact with a region indicated by a range (A) in  FIG. 12  on the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33 , namely, the region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25 B relative to the vane groove  75  is reduced at a rate equal to or more than a constant level along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X, the interval  69   c  is disposed at a position whit which the back pressure space  77 B communicates. \\n       FIG. 12  is an explanatory diagram showing a positional relation between the region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25 B relative to the vane groove  75  is reduced at a rate equal to or more than a constant level and the interval  69   c.    \\n     In this case, the volume of the back pressure space  77 B is reduced at a rate in accordance with a reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25 B in a state where the back pressure space  77 B is isolated from the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , and the pressure in the back pressure space  77 B temporarily rises as indicated by P 1  in  FIG. 13 . \\n     In a case where such a pressure rise of the back pressure space  77 B is generated, the vane  25 B which receives force acting in a direction of intruding into the vane groove  75  from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  attempts to project from the vane groove  75  by the risen pressure in the back pressure space  77 B. Then, there is a possibility that the pressing force of the vane  25 B against the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased more than necessary and the sliding resistance between the vane  25 B and the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased. \\n     Accordingly, it is configured such that a region in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  relative to the vane groove  75  along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X on the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  becomes a reduction rate not more than a predetermined threshold value which is lower than the above-mentioned constant rate is set as a region in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke is small, and the interval  69   c  is disposed so that the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c  when the vane  25  comes into sliding contact with the region in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke concerned is small in the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment. \\n     Specifically, in the present embodiment, the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  is, as shown in  FIG. 14 , formed so that four regions of: \\n     (a) a region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25  that is in sliding contact with the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  from the vane groove  75  is increased along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X; \\n     (b) a region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25  that is in sliding contact with the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  from the vane groove  75  is decreased along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X; \\n     (c) a region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25  that is in sliding contact with the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  from the vane groove  75  is decreased along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X and in which a reduction rate thereof is smaller than that in the region in (b); and \\n     (d) a region in which the projection stroke of the vane  25  that is in sliding contact with the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  from the vane groove  75  is decreased along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X and in which a reduction rate thereof is larger than that in the region in (c) and is smaller than that in the region in (b) \\n     are sequentially successive in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . \\n     Accordingly, the interval  69   c  is disposed at a position where the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval when the vane  25  is in sliding contact with the region (c) in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X is the smallest. \\n     Next, an operation of the gas compressor  1  according to the present embodiment will be described. \\n     Also in the present embodiment, at a time point when the back pressure space  77  having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , the preceding back pressure space  77  adjacent to the back pressure space  77  on the downstream side in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. \\n     Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space  77  having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply groove  67  communicates with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , the preceding back pressure space  77  adjacent to the back pressure space  77  on the downstream side in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. \\n     It is possible to prevent the pressure in the preceding back pressure space  77  from being temporarily lowered from the high pressure by the intermediate pressure before the following next back pressure space  77  rises to the high pressure, by allowing the two back pressure spaces  77  not to communicate with the first supply section  69   a  simultaneously. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of chattering in which the vane  25  repeats contact with and separation from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33 , by a temporary reduction of pressure in the back pressure space  77  of the vane  25  in the early stage of the compression process. \\n     Furthermore, the back pressure space  77  completes communication with the second supply section  69   b  before the back pressure space  77  of the next vane groove  75  which is positioned on the upstream side in the rotation direction X communicates with the second supply section  69   b . Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space  77  having completed communication with the first supply section  69   a  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  communicates with the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69 , the preceding back pressure space  77  adjacent to the downstream side of the back pressure space  77  in the rotation direction X does not communicate with the second supply section  69   b  simultaneously. \\n     Accordingly, as shown in the graph in  FIG. 15 , it is possible to prevent the occurrence of chattering in which the vane  25  repeats contact with and separation from the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  by a temporary reduction of pressure in the back pressure space  77  of the vane  25  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process. \\n     Furthermore, according to the gas compressor  1  of the present embodiment, the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  is positioned such that, when the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , the vane  25  stored in the vane groove  75  of the back pressure space  77  comes into sliding contact with the region (c) in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X is the smallest. \\n     Accordingly, when the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , the projection stroke of the vane  25  is hardly reduced as shown by a part surrounded by a round frame in  FIG. 15  and also the volume of the back pressure space  77  is hardly reduced. Therefore, as shown in  FIG. 15 , a temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  is not generated when the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c.    \\n     Consequently, as indicated by P 1  in the graph in  FIG. 13 , when the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  becomes the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b , it is possible to prevent, as shown in the graph in  FIG. 15 , a phenomenon in which the releasing route for the high pressure in the back pressure space  77  is eliminated and the pressure in the back pressure space  77  temporarily rises. \\n     Thereby, there is prevented a phenomenon in which the pressing force of the vane  25  against the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  is increased more than necessary by a temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  and thus the sliding resistance between the both is increased. Therefore, it is possible to prevent increase in the sliding resistance of the vane  25  to the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  due to increase in the power required for rotation of the rotor  23  by the temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process, thereby being able to maintain the operating performance as the gas compressor  1 . \\n     Note that it is desirable that the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  be formed into a shape of the largest possible size in the rotation direction X within a range in which the two back pressure spaces  77  mutually adjacent in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  do not simultaneously communicate with each other. Consequently, it is possible to allow the back pressure space  77  in which pressure has been increased from the intermediate pressure toward the high pressure due to communication with the first supply section  69   a  to communicate with the second supply section  69   b  from an earlier stage of the compression process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c , and thereafter to stabilize the pressure in the back pressure space  77  to the high pressure. \\n     Accordingly, it is possible to start the discharged process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  at an earlier stage, the open/close valve  37  of the discharge slot  35  is opened at an earlier stage and the high-pressure refrigerant in the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  is efficiently and sufficiently discharged, and thereby it is possible to achieve enhancement of refrigerant compression efficiency. \\n     Note that, although, in the present embodiment, the interval  69   c  provided between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  is set larger than the width of the back pressure space  77  of the vane groove  75 , the interval  69   c  may have a size smaller than that of the back pressure space  77  in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23 . In this case, when the back pressure space  77  strides over the interval  69   c  in shifting the communication destination of the back pressure space  77  from the first supply section  69   a  to the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply section  69 , the communication cross-sectional area of the back pressure space  77  for each of the supply sections  69   a  and  69   b  is reduced by an amount of overlapping the interval  69   c.    \\n     Since the communication cross-sectional area is reduced, when the vane  25  intrudes into the back pressure space  77  side of the vane groove  75  along with rotation of the rotor  23  and the volume of the back pressure space  77  is reduced, efficiency of releasing the high pressure in the back pressure space  77  to the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  is reduced by the amount of the reduced volume. Then, there is a possibility that the pressure in the back pressure space  77  may temporarily rise in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process, the pressing force of the vane  25  against the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased more than necessary and the sliding resistance between the vane  25  and the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  may be increased. \\n     However, the interval  69   c  is disposed at a position where the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c  when the vane  25  is in sliding contact with the region (c) in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  along with rotation of the rotor  23  in the rotation direction X is the smallest. Therefore, there can be prevented a temporary rise in the pressure in the back pressure space  77  by reduction in the releasing efficiency of the high pressure in the back pressure space  77 . Accordingly, it is possible to prevent a phenomenon in which the sliding resistance of the vane  25  to the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  is increased by the temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process and thus the power required for rotation of the rotor  23  is increased, thereby being able to maintain the operating performance as the gas compressor  1 . \\n     Note that, in the present embodiment, a region of the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  with which the vane  25  comes into sliding contact when the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c  was determined by the use of the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  to the vane groove  75  as a standard. In the determination, an upper limit value of an allowable range of the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  to the vane groove  75  is determined in accordance with an allowable range for a temporary increase in pressure in the back pressure space  77 . \\n     Then, the determined upper limit value is set as a predetermined threshold value, and there is determined a region in which the reduction rate of the projection stroke of the vane  25  on the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  becomes not more than this threshold value. The interval  69   c  may be disposed such that, when the vane  25  comes into sliding contact with the thus determined region on the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33 , the back pressure space  77  communicates with the interval  69   c.    \\n     By making the determination in this way, it is possible to maintain the temporary pressure increase of the back pressure space  77  by a reduction in projection stroke of the vane  25  within the allowable range during a period when the back pressure space  77  is in communication with the interval  69   c  between the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b . Accordingly, it is possible to prevent increase in the sliding resistance of the vane  25  to the inner peripheral surface  33   d  of the cylinder chamber  33  due to increase in the power required for rotation of the rotor  23  by the temporary pressure increase in the back pressure space  77  in the later stage of the compression process and in the discharged process, thereby being able to maintain the operating performance as the gas compressor  1 . \\n     In the present embodiment, it has been made such that the high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into the two mutually independent first supply section  69   a  and second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X. However, the present invention is applicable also in a case where the high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into three or more supply sections in the rotation direction X. In that case, the relation of the present invention is applied to a relative position of the interval between the two supply sections adjacent to each other in the rotation direction X and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder chamber. \\n     Other Embodiments \\n     In the above-mentioned plurality of embodiments, the second supply section  69   b  of the high-pressure supply groove  69  was set to have a size at which the two back pressure spaces  77  adjacent to each other in the rotation direction X of the rotor  23  do not communicate with each other simultaneously. For example, the second supply section  69   b  may have a space of a size larger than the size of the first supply section  69   a  in the rotation direction X. Consequently, it is possible to allow the back pressure space  77  in which pressure has been increased from the intermediate pressure toward the high pressure due to communication with the first supply section  69   a  to communicate with the second supply section  69   b  from an earlier stage of the compression process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c , and thereafter to stabilize the pressure in the back pressure space  77  to the high pressure. \\n     Accordingly, it is possible to start the discharged process of the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  at an earlier stage, the open/close valve  37  of the discharge slot  35  is opened at an earlier stage and the high-pressure refrigerant in the compression chambers  33   a ,  33   b  and  33   c  is efficiently and sufficiently discharged, and thereby it is possible to achieve enhancement of refrigerant compression efficiency. \\n     In addition, in the above-mentioned plurality of embodiments, a description has been made by taking, by way of example, a case of dividing the high-pressure supply groove  69  into two of the first supply section  69   a  and the second supply section  69   b  in the rotation direction X in order to prevent the back pressure space  77  of the vane  25  from communicating with the same supply section as that of the back pressure space  77  of the upstream-side vane  25  by way of example. However, the present invention is also widely applicable to a case where the high-pressure supply groove  69  is divided into three or more supply sections in the rotation direction X. \\n     In that case, it is possible to obtain the similar effects to those of the above-mentioned plurality of embodiments by forming, among the three or more supply sections, one supply section that communicates with the back pressure space  77  that is in a state where the pressure in the back pressure space  77  is in the middle of rising from the intermediate pressure to the high pressure, into a shape in which the two back pressure spaces  77  adjacent to each other in the rotation direction X do not communicate with each other simultaneously. \\n     Namely, the supply section positioned second from the most upstream side of the rotation direction X becomes at least an object to be formed into a shape in which the two back pressure spaces  77  adjacent to each other in the rotation direction X do not communicate with each other simultaneously. In addition, also each of the third and subsequent supply sections from the most upstream side becomes the object to be formed into a shape in which the two back pressure spaces  77  adjacent to each other in the rotation direction X do not communicate with each other simultaneously, in a case of communicating with the back pressure space  77  when the pressure of the back pressure space  77  is in the middle of rising from the intermediate pressure to the high pressure. \\n     The above embodiments of the present invention are merely illustrative ones which have been described for facilitating understanding of the present invention and the present invention is not limited to the embodiments concerned. The technical scope of the present invention includes, not limited to specific technical matters disclosed in the above-mentioned embodiments, various modifications, changes, alternative technologies and the like, which can be easily derived therefrom. \\n     The present application claims the priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-260491 filed on Dec. 24, 2014, based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-260492 filed on Dec. 24, 2014 and based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-260500 filed on Dec. 24, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n     INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY \\n     According to the present invention, the back pressure space of the vane groove having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply section communicates with the first supply section of the high-pressure supply section until the refrigerant pressure in each of the compression chambers having been partitioned by the vane stored in the vane groove reaches the highest pressure, and then the high pressure is supplied from the first supply section. Thereafter, this back pressure space completes communication with the first supply section before the back pressure space of the next vane groove on the upstream side of the rotation direction communicates with the first supply section, and then communicates with the next second supply section that is independent of the first supply section and subsequently the high pressure is again supplied thereto. \\n     Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply section communicates with the first supply section of the high-pressure supply section, the preceding back pressure space which is adjacent to the back pressure space on the downstream side in the rotation direction does not communicate with the first supply section simultaneously. Consequently, the pressure in the preceding back pressure space is prevented from being temporarily lowered from the high pressure by the intermediate pressure of the following next back pressure space and the occurrence of chattering of the vane by a temporary reduction in pressure in the back pressure space of the vane can be prevented. \\n     REFERENCE SIGNS LIST \\n     \\n         \\n         \\n           \\n               1  gas compressor \\n               2  housing \\n               3  compression section \\n               4  motor section \\n               5  inverter section \\n               7  front head \\n               9  rear case \\n               11  suction chamber \\n               13  inner wall \\n               15 ,  108  discharge chamber \\n               19  compression block \\n               21  oil separator \\n               23 ,  102  rotor \\n               23   a  outer peripheral surface \\n               25  ( 25 A,  25 B,  25 C),  103  vane \\n               27  drive shaft \\n               29 ,  100  cylinder block \\n               31 ,  101  side block \\n               31   a  front-side block \\n               31   b  rear-side block \\n               33 ,  105  cylinder chamber \\n               33   a ,  33   b ,  33   c ,  105   a ,  105   b ,  105   c  compression chamber \\n               33   d  inner peripheral surface \\n               35  discharge slot \\n               37 ,  109  open/close valve \\n               39  suction slot \\n               41  cylinder-side oil supply path \\n               43  front-side end surface \\n               47  front-side bearing \\n               49  front-side oil supply path \\n               51 ,  113  intermediate-pressure supply groove \\n               53 ,  114  high-pressure supply groove \\n               55  front-side annular groove \\n               57  rear-side end surface \\n               59  oil supply hole \\n               59   a  rear-side oil supply path \\n               59   b  rear-side oil supply path \\n               61  discharge hole \\n               63  rear-side bearing \\n               65  rear-side communication path \\n               67  intermediate-pressure supply groove (intermediate-pressure supply section) \\n               69  high-pressure supply groove (high-pressure supply section) \\n               69   a  first supply section (upstream-side supply section) \\n               69   b  second supply section (downstream-side supply section) \\n               69   c  interval \\n               71   a ,  71   b  high-pressure supply path \\n               73  rear-side annular groove \\n               75 ,  106  vane groove \\n               77  ( 77 A,  77 B,  77 C),  107  back pressure space \\n               79  stator \\n               81  motor rotor \\n               110  suction port \\n             O oil \\n             X rotation direction', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}]",

Thereafter, this back pressure space completes communication with the first supply section before the back pressure space of the next vane groove on the upstream side of the rotation direction communicates with the first supply section, and then communicates with the next second supply section that is independent of the first supply section and subsequently the high pressure is again supplied thereto.</p>\\n    <p id=\"p-0164\" num=\"0163\">Accordingly, at a time point when the back pressure space having completed communication with the intermediate-pressure supply section communicates with the first supply section of the high-pressure supply section, the preceding back pressure space which is adjacent to the back pressure space on the downstream side in the rotation direction does not communicate with the first supply section simultaneously. Consequently, the pressure in the preceding back pressure space is prevented from being temporarily lowered from the high pressure by the intermediate pressure of the following next back pressure space and the occurrence of chattering of the vane by a temporary reduction in pressure in the back pressure space of the vane can be prevented.</p>\\n    <heading id=\"h-0014\">REFERENCE SIGNS
