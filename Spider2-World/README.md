# Spider2-World

Spider2-World is a challenging code generation benchmark that requires writing SQL (primarily), Python, and Command Line commands to solve problems. ðŸ˜Š

#### Query-level Task
We transform almost all examples Spider2 into Spider2-World. The most distinctive feature is that it doesn't provide predefined schema information; the methods need to explore the database automatically and interactively write SQL. (Somewhat similar to the setting in [`Intercode`](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode))

#### Project-level Task
We also propose a new novel SQL generation task based on the **DBT project**, which is a highly realistic SQL generation scenario commonly used in industry development, requires completing a complex data transformation task. (Somewhat similar to the setting in [`SWE-Bench`](https://www.swebench.com/).
