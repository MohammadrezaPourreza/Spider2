## üì¢ Updates

- 2024-08-25: We released a subset of Spider2 to allow users early access. The full dataset and the paper will be released in two weeks. Stay tuned! ü§ó


## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

To meet the diverse research needs, we set up Spider2 with two settings, focusing on Advanced Text2SQL and general coding agent tasks, respectively. Most examples in these two **settings** overlap, differing mainly in the settings themselves.

[Spider2](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2): **Traditional Text2SQL Setting**. Focusing on Text2SQL, with detailed database metadata.ÔºàTiny Version: 20%)

[Spider2-World](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-World): **Code agent setting**. SQL generation in a real-**world** setting requires automatically exploring complex databases, using Python, SQL, and command-line tools to solve complex SQL generation tasks across different databases and to perform project-level code agent tasks. ÔºàTiny Version: 10%)


## Spider2 Baselines

For `Spider2`, we proposed baselines based on the widely used method: 
- [`Dail-SQL`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/Spider2-baselines/DailSQL/README.md), with evaluation results reported :test_tube:.
- [`CodeS`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-baselines/CodeS/README.md), the evaluation results will be avaiable soon.


### Dail-SQL

We evaluate two approaches, **Vanilla DailSQL** and **DailSQL+Func+Plan** with GPT-4o:
  
| Method                     | EX   | 
| -------------------------- | ---- | 
| vanilla DailSQL (GPT-4o)   | 3.54% | 
| DailSQL+Func+Plan (GPT-4o) | 8.84% |

For a detailed guideline of running Dail-SQL and evaluation results, please refer to [README of Dail-SQL](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-baselines/DailSQL).

### CodeS

For a detailed guideline of running CodeS, please refer to [README of CodeS](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-baselines/CodeS).


## Spider2-World Baselines
For `Spider2-World`, we proposed an agent framework [`Spider-Agent`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider-Agent) baseline with interactive environment.
