# Spider2: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for SQL Generation

<!-- ![Local Image](./assets/Spider2_Main.png) -->


## üì¢ Updates

- 2024-08-25: We released a subset of Spider2 to allow users early access. The full dataset and the paper will be released in two weeks. Stay tuned! ü§ó


## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

To meet the diverse research needs, we set up Spider2 with two settings, focusing on Advanced Text2SQL and general coding agent tasks, respectively. Most examples in these two settings overlap, differing mainly in the settings themselves.

[Spider2](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2): **Traditional Text2SQL Setting**. Focusing on Text2SQL, with detailed database metadata.ÔºàProgress: 20%)

[Spider2-World](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-World): **Code agent setting**. SQL generation in a real-**world** setting requires automatically exploring complex databases, using Python, SQL, and command-line tools to solve complex SQL generation tasks across different databases and to perform project-level code agent tasks. (Progress: 10%)


## Baselines

For `Spider2`, we proposed baselines based on the widely used method: 
- [`Dail-SQL`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/blob/main/Spider2-baselines/DailSQL/README.md), with evaluation results reported :laughing:.
- [`CodeS`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider2-baselines/CodeS/README.md), the evaluation results will be avaiable soon.

For `Spider2-World`, we proposed an agent framework [`Spider-Agent`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/Spider-Agent) baseline with interactive environment.
