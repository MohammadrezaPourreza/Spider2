# Spider 2.0: Evaluating Language Models on Real-World Enterprise Text-to-SQL Workflows


## üì∞ News

- 2024-08-28: We released a smaller version of Spider 2.0 (~ 25% of the full dataset) containing 190 examples to give users early access. The full dataset and the paper will be available in two weeks. Stay tuned! ü§ó

## üëã Overview

### Why Spider 2.0?

In 2018, our group proposed [Spider 1.0](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider), which has been widely used in Text-to-SQL research. 

However, real-world enterprise-level Text-to-SQL workflows often involve complex data and require advanced SQL queries across various operations. **We lack a comprehensive testbed to fully evaluate and develop Text-to-SQL capabilities.**

To this end, we introduce Spider 2.0, an evaluation framework comprising 600 real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases. 

We evaluated Spider 1.0, BIRD, and Spider 2.0 using the popular framework, [Dail-SQL](https://github.com/BeachWang/DAIL-SQL).

|                 | Spider 1.0 dev | Spider 1.0 test | BIRD test | Spider 2.0 |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| DailSQL + GPT-4 | 82.4           | 86.6            | 57.4      | 6.0        |
| CodeS-7B        | 85.4           | -               | 59.3      | 1.3        |




## üöÄ Quickstart


### Spider 2.0
For [`Spider 2.0`](./spider2/README.md), all evaluation examples are aggregated in file [`spider2_world.jsonl`](./spider2/evaluation_examples/spider2_world.jsonl), where each data point contains the following field:
```json
{
    "instance_id": "3a348be1-aed2-44fb-8185-c66c9d14a6ef", // str, UUID for the example
    "instruction": "Please tell me the number of sessions for each website traffic channel in December 2020.", // str, natural language instruction
    "type": "Bigquery" // example type, chosen from Local, Bigquery, DBT, Snowflake
}
```
For each instance, we also provide a separate folder [`./spider2/evaluation_examples/{instruction_id}`](./spider2/evaluation_examples/) as its **Execution Contetxt** to simulate the agentic setting. Each folder may have the following files:

- `README.md`: detailed requirements of the `instruction` field for the current example with `instance_id`;
- `*_credential.json`: credential file connecting to realistic enterprise-level databases, e.g., BigQuery. Can be replaced with your OWN;
- `result.csv`: CSV file to store the execution results;
- `query.py`: python program demonstrating how to connect to the database;
- other instance-specific materials which assist in finishing the current task:
    - <u>partial project</u>, e.g., [`dbt_project/`](./spider2/evaluation_examples/43d5ad49-0f99-4b90-a6df-d3afc5c216ff/).
    - <u>query history or samples</u>, e.g., [FIREBASE_QUERY_HISTORY](./spider2/evaluation_examples/1d009ac3-1c75-447b-a7e0-49ccc2b5fbf9/FIREBASE_QUERY_HISTORY/), [BASIC_SQLS](./spider2/evaluation_examples/e4a35097-4ff3-4ca7-8304-f593e039735b/BASIC_SQLS), etc.
    - <u>reference documentation</u>: [`ga4_dimensions_and_metrics.md`](./spider2/evaluation_examples/3a348be1-aed2-44fb-8185-c66c9d14a6ef/ga4_dimensions_and_metrics.md), [`retention_rate.md`](./spider2/evaluation_examples/22faca18-f766-46f5-a22b-c79de56fb6ec/retention_rate.md), etc.

<!-- - `instance_id`: (str) - A formatted instance identifier, UUID
- `instruction`: (str) - The instruction
- `type`: (str) - [Local, Bigquery, DBT, Snowflake]
- `./evaluation_examples/instanceid/*`: evaluation context
[`evaluation_examples`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2/evaluation_examples). -->

ü§ó Feel free to devise your intelligent and resolve the task defined in the `instruction` field and `README.md` file.


#### Run Spider-Agent

```
git clone https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2.git
cd methods/spider-agent

# Optional: Create a Conda environment for Spider 2.0
# conda create -n spider2 python=3.11
# conda activate spider2

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
python run.py --model gpt-4o --suffix test1
```



### Spider 2.0-Lite

To meet the needs of the research community, we've also organized the Spider 2.0 data in a format similar to Spider 1.0. [`Spider 2.0-Lite`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite#spider-20-lite) covers 90% of examples from Spider 2.0 that are sampled to be more lightweight and standalone, with a focus on evaluating LLMs on classic Text-to-SQL.

Each file in `spider2-lite.json` contains the following fields:
- `instance_id`: the unique example id
- `db`: the database id to which this question is addressed
- `question`: the natural language question
- `external_knowledge`: the filenames of external knowledge, documentation, and information required to answer this question are stored in documents
- `plan`: detailed instruction / reference plan for solving this problem
- `special_functions`: special functions that may be needed to answer this question

> **Note that** `plan` and `special_functions` are **not** standard inputs of Spider 2.0 challenge; they are used for ablation experiments and analysis.




We proposed baselines based on the widely used text2sql methods: [`Dail-SQL`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/dailsql#installation) and [`CodeS`](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/codes#installation), with evaluation results reported :test_tube:.

#### Run Dail-SQL

Set up the environment and dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n DAIL-SQL python=3.8
cd spider2-lite/baselines/dailsql
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nltk_downloader.py
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-3.5.0/en_core_web_sm-3.5.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Simply run :laughing::
```
bash run.sh
```

For a detailed guideline of running Dail-SQL, please refer to [Installation](https://github.com/xlang-ai/Spider2/tree/main/spider2-lite/baselines/dailsql#installation).
