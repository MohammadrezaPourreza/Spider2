# Bigquery Guideline

A large number of databases in Spider2 are stored in BigQuery, including many large databases that reach TB-level. If you want to use the BigQuery Web UI to view database details, please refer to the following guidelines.

Please note that after registering an account, you can directly view 70% of the databases. However, for the remaining 30% of the databases (spider2-public-data), **you need to fill in your BigQuery account information in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrsJX-oDZDL0McIaF-0uypLeO2pYW4SX-qDeNSd88iYR_3Gg/viewform)**, and we will grant you permanent access within 12 hours.
