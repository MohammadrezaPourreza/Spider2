# Bigquery Guideline

A large number of databases in Spider2 are stored in BigQuery, including many large databases that reach TB-level. If you want to use the BigQuery Web UI to view database details, please refer to the following guidelines.

Please note that after sign up an account, you can directly view 70% of the databases. However, for the remaining 30% of the databases (spider2-public-data), **you need to fill in your BigQuery account information in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrsJX-oDZDL0McIaF-0uypLeO2pYW4SX-qDeNSd88iYR_3Gg/viewform)**, and we will grant you permanent access within 12 hours.
