4059228,"Self cleaning, pressure responsive emitter valve for soil irrigation",1974-09-03,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an emitter valve particularly suited for irrigation of soil. 2. Description of the Prior Art Irrigation of soil for proper growth vegetation requires the supply of sufficient water thereto with added minerals and other nutrients as may be required. It has been long recognized that indiscriminate watering not only is wasteful of water but also is possibly harmful to plants; therefore, metering of water in accordance with plant requirements has been used. Accordingly, a great many devices have been devised to meet this need, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,547,355 (patented Dec. 15, 1970) and in copending patent application, Ser. No. 331,128 filed Feb. 9, 1973, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,591 (patented Apr. 1, 1975). Regardless of the design of prior art devices, however, many problems still exist. Metering devices, in particular, become clogged with solid particulate matter and algae, especially during periods of non-use, and therefore, present obstacles to precise metering of water. Furthermore, prior art emitters more distant from the source of water receive less water than closer emitters because the available water pressure decreases in proportion to distance, with the result that more distant soil areas receive less water than those closer to the source of water. As a corollary, it has also been found that areas at lower elevations receive more water than those at higher elevations because of the respective build-up or drop-off of pressure as water flows down hill or must be forced up hill. Further, soil textures may differ from a porous sand to a non-porous clay. Some areas may be shaded while others are exposed to the sun. Therefore, the problems which presently exist have not been altogether adequately or satisfactorily met. The present invention overcomes these and other problems by providing an emitter valve with an element therein having a resilient flat end with a groove therein which moves against an annular protuberance at the emitter outlet. Thus, flow of water from the emitter is inversely proportional to water pressure. In a preferred embodiment the element is provided with spring-like means so as to normally space the element from the outlet, thereby to impede movement of the element against the outlet during initial turn-on of water and, conversely, to impel the deformable element away from the outlet when the water is turned off. In both cases, water surges either from the initial pressure build up or from relief of pressure having already been built up so as to flush any solid particulate matter or other debris from the emitter valve. Furthermore, when the entire element is made deformable, and is provided with a stem extending within a water inlet of the valve and other centering means, the emitter valve is capable of maintaining a substantially constant flow of water to the soil regardless of elevation or distance from the source of water, provided that an adequate volume of water is permitted to flow through the system. The groove in the deformable element cooperating with the outlet annular protuberance enhances and provides for control of water flow, depending upon the shape of the groove and its cooperation with the annular outlet protuberance. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an emitter valve for irrigation of soil. Another object is the provision of such an emitter valve for furnishing metered amounts of water to the soil. Another object is to provide an emitter valve for furnishing metered amounts of water to the soil according to varying soil porousity, temperatures, elevations of the soil, and shade conditions. Another object is the provision of such an emitter valve which is deformable upon application of water supply pressure. Another object is to provide an emitter valve which is capable of flushing itself out at the times of water turn on and turn off. Another object is the provision of an emitter valve in which the supply of water to soil is inversely proportional to water pressure, that is, a decrease in water pressure increases the supply of water to soil and an increase in water pressure decreases the supply of water to the soil. Other aims and objects, as well as a more complete understanding of the present invention, will become apparent from the following explanation of exemplary embodiments and the accompanying drawings thereof."
3987826,Compact tree clamp and automatic sequence control for a tree length harvester,1975-06-16,1,1,"The invention pertains to the art of tree processors or mobile tree harvesters and especially the type referred to as tree length harvesters having a felling head which shears a tree at the ground and holds it upright and then pivots it to a horizontal position for delimbing and topping. A tree length harvester of this type is disclosed in the copending application U.S. Ser. No. 363,936, filed May 25, 1973, claiming priority based on Canadian application Ser. No. 163,290 filed Feb. 6, 1973, by inventors Ian McKenzie et al and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Its operation is in a sequence that permits the felling head to return for a second tree while the cut tree is being delimbed and topped. This substantially reduces the over-all processing time per tree and increases the productivity of the machine. In order to cycle the delimber while returning the felling head for a second tree, it is necessary to clamp the tree. But no clamp has heretofore been devised that functions properly on a tree length harvester and without interfering with the simultaneous processing of trees. One difficulty is that the tree must be transferred from the felling head to the clamp. The combined stack height of the felling head and clamp becomes a factor in permitting the delimber to start out close enough to the butt end of the tree. When it fails to get behind all of the limbs, the trees must be partially delimbed by hand. To deal with this problem, the clamp should be as narrow as possible. The delimber can then be started very near the upper clamp on the felling head when the tree is laid in its horizontal delimbing position. This, however, requires the clamp to be very narrow. Another problem has been the tendancy of the delimbed and topped tree to hang up after the delimber has cleared. That is, the tree is prevented from rolling laterally into the storage rack after being delimbed and topped. This stops the delimber from being recycled until the tree can be removed. Interruptions such as this cannot be tolerated in such a high production machine. A compact tree clamp, especially for a tree length harvester, has a fixed jaw and a movable jaw closing on the fixed jaw. The fixed jaw has an arcuate tooth section. The movable jaw is pivoted at two locations. A first pivot is on the fixed jaw and allows the movable jaw to be partially folded or collapsed into spaced frame sections of the fixed jaw. When collapsed in this fashion, the tree is clamped in the teeth of the fixed jaw and prevented from axial movement by an arm of the movable jaw pivoted about a second pivot on the opposite side of the tree axis from the first pivot. After delimbing and topping, the movable jaw is tilted up about the first pivot while the arm continues to hold the tree. This raises the butt end of the tree and shifts it laterally toward the storage rack. The arm is pivoted about the second pivot unclamping the tree to roll it into the storage rack. In the application on a horizontal tree harvester, the clamp becomes a functional part of the over-all machine when it is considered that the felling head must transfer the tree to the clamp before delimbing can proceed and the felling head returned for a second tree. In such a harvester, the tree clamp serves the function, not only of securely clamping the tree for delimbing, but also provides the capability of simultaneous processing which is fundamental to the high productivity of this type of harvester. Consistent with this objective and method of processing full length trees, the present invention is viewed as a tree length harvester automatic sequence control including means (a pivoted plate) on the movable jaw actuated by a tree deposited on the fixed jaw, a fluid pressure source, an actuating circuit connected to said source including a control element (sequence valve), a first cylinder for pivoting the arm of the movable jaw actuated by the control element in one position to close the arm, means (first valve) in the actuating circuit operated by the arm when closed initiating the delimbed cycle, a second means (second valve) operated at the end of the delimber stroke to shift the control element to a second position, a second cylinder actuated in said second position to tilt the movable jaw, means (third valve) operated when the second cylinder is extended to cause said control element to operate the first cylinder and to open the arm releasing the tree which allows said first means (pivoted plate) to return causing the second cylinder to lower the movable jaw. In the preferred embodiment, the movable jaw will have its arm pivoted on an axis parallel to the delimber axis. The entire movable jaw is also pivoted about a second or main pivot axis on the opposite side of the delimber axis. The first cylinder is carried on the movable jaw and is operable to pivot the arm about its pivot axis. The second cylinder extends between the spaced frame of the fixed jaw and is operable for pivoting the movable jaw about its main pivot axis. The arm has an interior arc, which when closed, overlies and partially encloses the tree. The movable jaw carries the pivoted actuating plate in such position that as the teeth penetrate the tree, which is forced down from above by the arm, the plate is automatically depressed initiating the cycle. After delimbing and topping, the movable jaw is pivoted about its main axis by operating the second cylinder. The actuating plate remains engaged with the tree and in the depressed condition since the tree is still clamped by the arm of the movable jaw. The butt end of the tree is moved upwardly and laterally with respect to the delimber axis. At the uppermost position, the first cylinder is extended to open the arm of the movable jaw permitting the tree to roll down into the storage rack. This releases the actuating plate permitting the second cylinder to return lowering the movable jaw. It is one advantage of the invention that the tree clamp has a dual capability. In the one case, the tree is secured against axial movement between the fixed and movable jaws while in the other case it is grasped and pivoted out of the fixed jaw by the movable jaw. Thus a principal advantage of the invention is a clamp that functions both as an axial tree clamp and tree ejection device for positive removal of the tree regardless of the slope on which the machine is operated. Anothher advantage for tree length harvesters is that the clamping jaws form a compact arrangement without increasing the stack height to the detriment of the delimber operation. A major advantage in the over-all function of a tree length harvester is that higher productivity is achieved because of positive ejection. The delimbed and topped tree is quickly and positively ejected to make room for the second tree after each delimbing and topping cycle. A further major advantage is the provision of an automatic sequence control for a tree length harvester in which the tree clamp initiates the sequence. These and other advantages will be readily apparent by referring to the following more detailed description wherein:"
4055915,Method of and apparatus for treating plant organisms,1975-09-29,1,1,"The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for treating plant organisms such as seeds and plants, and in particular it relates to the induced acceleration of seed and plant metabolism. In the various branches of agriculture and horticulture much time, money and effort is expended in attempting to induce seeds to germinte faster and more uniformly and to induce plants to grow more quickly. The benefits of such acceleration in the metabolisms of plant organisms are self-evident and are becoming increasingly important in a world where there is an increasing demand for more food produced faster than is done conventionally. According to a first aspect of this invention there is provided a method of inducing acceleration of the metabolisms of plant organisms such as seeds and plants and including the steps of testing the plant organism to determine a frequency favoured by the plant organism and applying sound at said """"favored frequency"""" to the plant organism while the latter is subjected to the conditions of heat, light and moisture normally provided. Preferably, if full advantage of the sound application process is to be obtained, the plant organism is tested regularly to determine its progress and where appropriate, the conditions of heat, light and moisture to which the plant organism is subjected are changed more rapidly than normal. In a preferred embodiment for the enhancement of plant growth a small interrogating electrical current is applied across a portion of the plant, sound of different predetermined frequencies is applied to the plant and variations in the interrogating current are observed so as to determine optimum responses of the plant as the frequency of the sound is varied and subsequently applying to the plant sound of the """"favored frequency"""" that has been observed to produce a predetermined optimum response. In a preferred embodiment for the germination of seeds, the seeds are bombarded with sound whose frequency is varied over a range and the sound level transmitted and reflected by the seeds is detected to determine which frequencies are best absorbed by the seeds. The """"favored frequency"""" is then selected from the best-absorbed frequencies by the application of an interrogating current passed through selected ones of the seeds while subjected to sound of respective ones of the best-absorbed frequencies, the resistance characteristics of the respective seeds indicating which frequency is the """"favored frequency"""". According to a second aspect of this invention there is provided apparatus for inducing a break in dormancy and/or inducing germination of a batch of seeds, said apparatus including a container for water, a perforated container for the seeds mounted within the water container and sound producing means mounted on the seed container. Preferably the sound producing means is in the form of a rolling diaphragm speaker."
4067369,Whole tree extraction device,1976-01-05,1,1,"This invention relates generally to a machine for extracting substantially the whole tree from its position in the ground. More particularly, it relates to a device for shearing certain of the roots, grasping the stem and then extracting the stem/root combination while applying selected vibratory forces to the tree mass. In the past, it has not been necessary to consider the desirability and/or economic factors in extracting wood fiber contained in the portion of a tree commonly referred to as the stump/root portion mainly because there was sufficient wood fiber available from the above-ground harvested stems. The traditional method of harvesting trees is to sever the stem at a point somewhere close to ground level and then leave the stump and root system in the ground. In view of the projected wood fiber demand over time, it has now become necessary to consider that wood fiber below ground level. As is well understood by those familiar with commercially growing forests, a substantial portion of wood fiber is contained in the stump/root portion of the overall tree, and if an efficient economical way of extracting that wood fiber were available, then, additional wood fiber could be made available to satisfy projected demands. The normal use for the below-ground wood fiber, as one skilled in the art would expect, is for use in the pulping process to make paper products. Generally, the wood fiber in the stump/root portion is not suitable for making lumber products, or the like. Of course, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art, that different tree species have different subsurface characteristics. For example, most of the southern Pine species growing in the mid-South and Southeastern states have a plurality of laterally extending roots, together with a downwardly extending tap root, commonly referred to as a """"carrot root."""" It is the tap root that contains a substantial amount of wood fiber that could be utilized in the pulping process to make useful end products. As will be appreciated, there are many parameters to consider in designing a suitable apparatus to remove the subsurface wood fiber. For example, shearing forces to cross-cut through lateral roots must be considered as well as depth of shearing action, extraction forces to remove the whole tree and severed root system, dirt contained on the root system, and the hole left by removing the root system. Other considerations are productivity, cost, ease of maintenance, and flexibility. Of course, others have recognized the value of extracting the wood fiber contained in the tree at subsurface levels. Certain earlier approaches extracted the stump and root system left after cutting, while several newer approaches extract the tree together with a certain portion of the root system. One example of such a whole tree extraction device is that currently being offered by Rome Industries of Cedar Town, Ga. This particular device is generally described in a publication entitled """"Canadian Pulp and Paper Industry,"""" June, 1975. The particular design disclosed in the aforementioned publication does have the ability to extract whole trees from the ground, but does not offer the cleaning function integral with the extraction unit. Another example of a whole tree extraction device may be seen by referring to U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,883 which was issued to A. G. Bodine. The Bodine device does have provision for applying vibratory movements to an extractor unit but not in the same manner nor with the same structure as does the present device. Accordingly, from the foregoing, one object of the present invention is to provide a whole tree extraction device having the capability of cleaning the root system. Another object is to provide a whole tree extraction device wherein vibration is applied in order to enhance the shearing, cleaning, and extraction process. Another object is to provide a design utilizing vibratory forces that will extract and clean relatively large trees. These, and other objects will become apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the attached drawing. Briefly stated, this invention is practiced in one form by a whole tree extraction device mounted on a prime mover. The extraction device is comprised of a load frame which is carried and supported by the prime mover. Slidably mounted on one side of the load frame is the power frame to which is attached at least one power cylinder for moving the power frame with respect to the load frame. Mounted on the power frame fowardly thereof is a vibrator frame to which is attached a pair of cooperating shearing blades together with a pair of cooperating gripping extractor arms. A pair of upper gripper arms are mounted on the load frame and open and close in response to a command signal independently of the shearing blades and gripping extractor arms. Means to vibrate the shearing blades and the gripping extractor arms relative to the power frame in a substantially vertical plane during the shearing and extracting modes are operable on a command signal."
4059920,Hanging flower pot arrangement,1976-03-03,1,1,"A variety of hanging flower pot arrangements have been provided in the past and some of them have included dishes to receive excess water positioned below the flower pot. Such an arrangement is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 1,648,570. However, the dishes of such devices have not been spaced from the flower pot, but on the contrary have been fastened directly in engagement therewith such as is illustrated in the patent. Accordingly, it is an important object of the present invention to provide a hanging flower pot assembly wherein a dish may be readily positioned in spaced relation to the bottom of a flower pot to receive excess water therefrom to avoid excessive soaking of the roots of plants within the flower pot. Another inportant object of the invention is to provide a versatile molded plastic flower pot arrangement which may be shipped and packaged in pieces and readily asssembled by the user. Another important object of the invention is to provide a plastic flower pot assembly which will be attractive, inexpensive, easily assembled and particularly conducive to the growth of healthy plants in hanging arrangements. It has been found that a hanging flower pot arrangement may be constructed wherein a dish is spaced beneath the flower pot by providing circumferentially spaced flexible projections extending upwardly from the dish to be received within an opening within the flower pot and spaced protuberances provided for maintaining the dish in properly spaced relation below the flower pot so that the dish may receive water for avoiding injury to the root system of the plants contained within the flower pot."
4050486,Apparatus for delimbing trees,1976-12-06,1,1,"The present invention relates to improved apparatus for harvesting trees, and more particularly to improved delimber blades for a tree harvesting apparatus. In the mechanized harvesting of trees a common method for removing the limbs from a tree employs a plurality of curved or bent blades which are moved into contact with the trunk of the tree. The blades are then either moved along the tree trunk to shear off the limbs, or the blades are held stationary while the tree trunk is propelled through the blades. U.S. Pat. No. 3,894,568 discloses a harvester apparatus in which four movable delimber blades and one stationary delimber blade are mounted on a processing head which travels along a horizontal boom to delimb a tree clamped in a stationary position on the boom. In U.S. Pat. No. 3,833,034 there is disclosed a harvester apparatus in which two movable delimber blades and one stationary delimber blade are mounted in a fixed position while a tree is propelled by a roller drive mechanism through the delimber blades, which are closed upon the trunk. In both of the above types of harvester apparatus, the action of the individual delimber blades is the same. The movable blades are closed upon the tree trunk with sufficient pressure to maintain contact with the trunk and to maintain the trunk in contact with the stationary blade while the tree and blades move relative to one another. It can be appreciated that as a practical matter it is not possible for a blade type delimber to completely encircle a tree trunk from the base to the top without using a large number of blades and/or providing a complex mechanism for moving the blades into contact with the tree. Accordingly, the blades are arranged and shaped in a manner which permits adequate delimbing at all trunk diameters within the capacity range of the harvester. Because of the rough use to which such equipment is put it is important to keep the mechanism as simple as possible. It has been found that a delimber assembly employing no more than four movable blades, and preferably two movable and strategically shaped blades provides a good balance between design simplicity and effective delimbing coverage. In designing blades to suit the above design considerations, one problem which arises is that the blades must be very sharp and cut close to the trunk to adequately delimb smaller branches near the top or small diameter portion of the tree; however, such blades tend to dig into the bark and carve valuable wood away from the larger diameter portions of the tree. Conversely, blades which are shaped to avoid this tendency do not provide clean delimbing of the smaller branches near the top of the tree. Based on the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a set of delimber blades for a tree harvester which are effective to cleanly delimb all branches within the diameter capacity of the tree harvester without undue wastage of wood. Another object of the invention is to provide delimber blades which will not dig or gouge into the trunk of a tree when cutting relatively large branches, but which will still be effective to cut relatively small branches sufficiently close to the bark to provide satisfactory delimbing. Another object of the invention is to provide a set of delimber blades which are simple and relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Another object of the invention is to provide a delimber assembly comprising two movable blades and one stationary blade, all of which are bent or curved to the same angle and all of which are sharpened to the same profile or combination of profiles, and which are effective to cleanly cut all branches encountered in delimbing trees within the diameter capacity of the harvester apparatus. To meet the above objectives the present invention provides a delimber assembly having a plurality of delimber blades, in which each blade includes a first region shaped to ride against the relatively large diameter portion of a tree trunk without digging into the bark of the tree, and a second region shaped to ride against the relatively small diameter portion of the tree trunk. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the delimber assembly comprises a single stationary blade and a pair of blades movable into contact with the tree trunk, each of the blades being identically shaped in cross-section and bent to the same included angle for ease of manufacture, and interchangeability."
4160523,Air structure,1977-04-08,1,1,"This invention concerns air structures - that is to say structures the major boundary walls of which are defined by flexible material that is at least substantially impermeable to air and intended to be supported and/or stiffened into a desired configuration by the application of a pressure differential to the respective surfaces thereof. A hot-air balloon is an example of such a structure but the principles involved have been applied or proposed for application to a wide variety of constructs, such as stadia and like arenas, temporary buildings and enclosures for, e.g., exhibition purposes, greenhouses and so on. With certain exceptions, most air structures hitherto constructed or proposed have relied upon inflation of their contained volume or of some part thereof to establish the required pressure differential to support and/or stiffen the flexible walls into the desired configuration. This inflation has in general been accomplished by the use of mechanical devices such as fans and blowers driven by energy-consuming motors so that although the structure may have a low energy content in the materials of its construction, as well as the advantages of light weight and ease of construction and erection, its continued existence in an erected condition involves the continuing expenditure of energy. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide an air structure the erection and maintenance of which is at least partly accomplished by the utilisation of energy derived from its surroundings, for instance solar radiation energy. The use of solar radiation energy for inflation of an air structure has been proposed hitherto but such proposals as have been tested have exhibited unsatisfactory characteristics, mainly as a result of their being based upon constructional principals applicable to structures intended to be inflated and maintained by the continuous application of internal positive pressure by mechanical devices. For the efficient utilisation of solar radiation, the direct conversion of such radiation to longer-wave energy must take place within the confines of the structure and accomplish direct heating of the air therewith in order to achieve the required pressure differential for satisfactory inflation of the structure. Such design principles therefore imply the utilisation of wall-forming components that are suitably transparent to the solar radiation. In general it has not been found possible, hitherto, to obtain an adequate pressure differential across the walls of such a structure, inflated by the use of solar radiation energy, to make the structure sufficiently rigid to resist deformation under wind loads. Moreover, in common with mechanically-inflated structures, the existence of a positive pressure within the structure tends to supplement the aerodynamic lift forces that are applied to the structure by winds blowing thereover. Accordingly, structures such as hitherto proposed to be maintained by utilisation of solar energy would in general be viable only in relatively still air conditions. An air structure in accordance with the present invention in accordingly characterised by having a double-skin wall construction of which at least the outer skin is at least substantially transparent to shortwave solar radiation but relatively opaque to long wave heat radiation, the inter-skin space including at least one radiation converter element effective to absorb solar radiation and to convert the same to heat energy. An air structure in accordance with the invention is self-erecting when exposed to solar radiation. Such radiation is able to enter the inter-skin space via the outer skin that is at least substantially transparent to such radiation and within the inter-skin space becomes converted into heat energy that is released into the air contained within the inter-skin space. As a result of heating, such contained air expands and becomes less dense than the ambient atmosphere so that the structure becomes buoyant. Because the outer skin at least is opaque to long wave heat radiation, the heat energy derived from the solar radiation is unable to escape from the structure -- otherwise than into the space enclosed by the structure -- and the structure can accordingly self-erect and maintain itself in conditions of relatively low solar energy availability. The structure of the invention may be adapted for use as an unanchored flying structure for use, for instance, as a flying ship, a floating """"cloud"""" for transporting water, or for meteorological or telecommunications purposes. Alternatively, the structure may be anchored, and thus a further feature of the invention may comprise means for anchoring the perimeter of said double-skin construction so that the latter may adopt an arched configuration when inflated. Preferably the periphery of the double-skin wall construction is adapted to be sealed to the ground so that either the enclosed space may be pressurised to increase the rigidity of the structure for certain applications or so that any tendency of the double-skin wall construction to extend owing to wind lift, and thereby increase the contained volume of the enclosure defined by the structure, will result in a lowering of the pressure within the enclosed space and thereby partial compensation for the aerodynamic lift forces. The structure of the invention may have a wide range of configurations and dimensions, ranging from a single arch with a span of a few meters to a macro structure having a plurality of connected arches and of sufficient size to cover, for example, a city or a forest, and the structure may thus be used for a variety of different purposes. For instance, the structure may be floated on water to provide a cover for fish farming operations. Alternatively, the structure may be used as a swimming pool cover and may be adapted to perform the additional function of heating water for the pool by utilizing solar energy. In addition, the structure of the invention is ideally suited to the construction of greenhouses because by appropriate selection of the materials for the skins of the wall construction the latter may be arranged to transmit to the enclosure defined by the structure that portion (wavelengths in the range 400-700nm) of the solar radiation spectrum that is especially conducive to photosynthesis. Because the air within the enclosure need not participate in the function of erecting and maintaining the structure in an erect condition, the atmospheric conditions within the enclosure may be controlled and adjusted independently of the conditions within the inter-skin space of the wall construction. Desirably the double-skin wall construction comprises inner and outer skin linked together at intervals by diaphragms that constitute the said energy converters, these diaphragms thus performing a plurality of functions: controlling the separation of the inner and outer skins; dividing the inter-skin space into tunnel like spaces within which the contained air is in relatively close proximity to and may maintain vigorous circulation in contact with the diaphragms to collect heat energy therefrom; and the function of absorbing solar radiation and converting this to heat energy. In preferred embodiments of the invention the structure has the configuration of an extended large-span arch terminated by part-spherical ends, the diaphragms forming the said energy converters extending in parallel planes at right angles to the axis of curvature of the arch, and similarly in the part-spherical ends, so that the tunnel-like spaces between the diaphragms extend upwardly from the perimeter of the structure to its highest level. This arrangement is favoured for various reasons amongst which may be cited the convenience of integrating the diaphragm/skin junctions with attachments or housings for receiving anchoring cables or like flexible but strong-in-tension elements serving both to reinforce the skins and to provide for the convenient diffusion of anchoring loads into the skin. The anchoring cables preferably have elastic properties, thus allowing the wall construction to extend and so reduce the pressure within the space enclosed by the structure thereby compensating for aerodynamic lift forces. Another advantage of this configuration is that it allows for provision of convective or forced air flow through the tunnel-like spaces for control of the buoyancy of the structure and for such other purposes as extracting moisture from the ambient atmosphere, as will be explained. Advantageously the double-skin wall construction has provision for controlled venting thereof for pressure regulation and other purposes. Thus it should be understood that in conditions of high solar energy availability, air contained within the inter-skin space may expand to the extent that it must be allowed to vent to relieve excess pressure. Desirably vents are provided near the periphery of the wall and the inter-skin space is arranged to communicate with a thermal store, such as a concrete member or a pile of soil, sand rocks or the like, through which escaping air may pass to give up heat to the store and from which re-entering air may gain heat for reinflation of the inter-skin space, e.g. under subsequent conditions of reduced solar radiation availability and decrease in contained air temperature. In a convenient arrangement, the thermal store may consist of a rock pile serving the dual purpose of functioning as a thermal store and of anchoring the perimeter of the double-skin wall construction to the ground. The venting arrangements for the inter-skin space of the wall construction may provide for the forcing of air flow through the inter-skin space by the use of fans or other mechanical devices or, preferably, by the effects of pressure differences between the sides of the structure and due, for instance, to the wind or to the effects of shadow on one side. Thus at the perimeter of the wall there may be provided valves such as simple flap valves to control the ingress and egress of air to the inter-skin space and where appropriate such valves may communicate with external shrouds or conduits for the purpose of enhancing or directing the flow of air into and out of the inter-skin space. The double-skin wall construction may be formed of a variety of materials but flexible plastics materials such as for instance film or sheet polyester, PVC, polyethylene and like materials are preferred because these may be obtained in forms having the desired combination of physical and mechanical properties. Thus in preferred embodiments of the invention the outer skin at least of the wall is formed of a plastic film material that is transparent to short wave solar radiation while being relatively opaque to long wave heat radiation whereas the inner skin may either be formed of similar material having comparable physical properties or it may be formed of a material that is at least partly reflective to solar radiation to limit the passage of solar radiation beyond the inter-skin space and into the enclosure defined by the structure. Such reflectivity can conveniently be accomplished by """"silvering"""" the base material of the skin as by metal deposition thereon or by the incorporation of a suitable metallic layer in a laminated skin construction. In preferred embodiments in which the energy converters are constituted by diaphragms linking the inner and outer skins of the wall, such diaphragms may again be formed of a plastics sheet material but of a suitably absorbtive character as regards solar radiation: for instance such diaphragms may be formed of a black or blackened plastics sheet material. The structure of the invention may be equipped to perform a variety of ancillary functions appropriate to the intended utilisation of the structure. For instance if the characteristics of the inner skin are such that it mainly reflects solar energy it may take up a temperature below the dew-point of the ambient atmosphere and so be available for use as a condensing surface. By the provision of suitable arrangements for conducting the ambient atmosphere over the inner skin, such as appropriately located adjustable inlet and outlet valves, condensation will occur on the inner skin and condensate may be collected. Alternatively at least a portion of the inner skin may be made partly absorbent in respect of solar radiation so as to adopt a relatively high temperature and therefore be available as a heating surface for the evaporation of, e.g., brackish or salt water caused to flow over that surface by suitable pumping means. Water vapour so produced may then be conducted, for example by air flow controlled by appropriately located inlet and outlet valves, to suitable condensing surfaces, for instance other parts of the inner skin that are at a lower temperature by reason of being shaded or by reason of having suitably chosen physical properties for the purpose. Thus the structure may be caused to function as a solar still. The structure may be equipped with means for modifying the properties of the wall with respect to transmission and reflection of radiation. For instance the inter-skin space may house inflatable reflective elements adapted, when inflated, to overlie the internal surface of the outer skin and thus give this reflective properties to minimise the ingress of solar radiation into the inter-skin space. The said means for anchoring the structure conveniently comprise cables or like tension elements connected to and radiating from the perimeter of the double-skin wall construction and desirably, as has been mentioned, the anchoring loads are diffused into the wall construction by means of cables housed in the junctions between the wall skins and diaphragms linking the latter. In a preferred arrangement, the anchoring means comprise cables that extend from anchorage points on opposite sides of the structure through tunnel-like housings formed at the junction between the inner skin and each of the said diaphragms so that the inner skin is controlled in shape by the anchoring loads. However, for particularly large structures additional cables may extend in similar housings at the junctions between the diaphragms and the outer-skin. In order to achieve an efficient seal between the wall construction and the ground, when such sealing is desired, the inner skin is preferably of larger extent than the outer skin so that its peripheral portion may be held in contact with the ground as by loading with suitable massive objects such as rocks, bricks, water tanks and so on, without interferring with the free movement of the periphery of the outer skin relatively to the inner skin during self-erection of the structure and changes in the wall configuration due to changing ambient and wind conditions. When the structure of the invention is to be used as a greenhouse, the inner skin of the double-skin wall construction is preferably extended across the base of the structure to form a continuous under skin that prevents water loss in a downwards direction from the enclosure defined by the structure. For use, the under skin is covered with soil or other growing medium."
4098006,Organic waste dewatering and drying process,1977-07-07,1,1,"The invention relates to the removal of water from solid organic waste. The invention also relates to the drying of solid material by contacting the solid material with hot vapors. The invention particularly relates to the sequential dewatering and drying of an organic waste, such as sewage sludge, and to the production of fertilizer or soil builders from the organic waste. The large amounts of organic waste which are produced annually and the need to dispose of this waste have prompted attempts to develop economic organic waste disposal methods. Increasingly stringent environmental standards have also acted as a stimulus to the development of such methods. One well known method is that utilized in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wis., to dry municipal sewage sludge to produce an organic plant food called Milorganite. I t is believed that the sludge is dried by the use of large rotating kilns through which hot vapors are passed. A different system in which a flash dryer is used is in operation in Houston, Tex. It is therefore known in the art to dry organic waste by contact with hot vapors. The prior art processes have two other features in common with the subject process. First, the vaporous effluent of the drying zone is often passed into a solids-vapor separation zone to collect or remove particles of the solid product. This zone typically comprises one or more cyclone-type separators. Second, it is known in the art to recycle a portion of the dried product and to admix this dry material with the incoming feed material. However, this is performed to form a somewhat drier charge material which is fed to the drying zone. The drier charge material is desired to expedite the feeding of the organic waste into the drying zone and to lessen accumulation of the raw waste material on the walls of the drying zone. The preferred toroidal drying zone is well described in the literature. It is described for instance in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,329,418 (Cl. 263-21); 3,339,286 (Cl. 34-10); 3,403,451 (Cl. 34-10); 3,546,784; 3,550,921 (Cl. 263-53); 3,648,936 (Cl. 241-5); 3,667,131; 3,856,215 (Cl. 241-39); 3,922,796 and 3,945,130. The use of such a dryer in a process for the treatment of organic wastes is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,802,089 (Cl. 34-8). This reference shows the discharge of the toroidal dryer being directed into a cyclone separator and the recycling of the separator off-gas to the drying zone. The preferred toroidal dryer may be similar in structure to the size reduction apparatus referred to as a fluid energy or jet mill. This apparatus is described at pages 8-43 of the 4th Edition of The Chemical Engineers' Handbook published by McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1963. The subject dryer is operated in a manner similar to many of these mills except for the use of heated gas streams as the high-velocity streams charged to the apparatus. Previously cited U.S. Pat. No. 3,802,089 is pertinent for its disclosure of the use of a dewatering unit to remove water from organic waste prior to its injection into a toroidal drying zone. The teaching of this reference is, however, limited to the use of a centrifuge or a vacuum filter or a combination of the two. U.S. Pat. No. 3,984,329 (Cl. 210-396) presents a conveyor-type device designed for dewatering sewage sludge. These references do not suggest the extrusion of the organic waste, nor do they suggest the admixture of the organic waste with the dried product prior to extrusion as part of a dewatering and drying operation. Previously cited U.S. Pat. No. 3,802,089 also discloses the admixture of various additives into the dried material prior to the pelletization of the dried material. The additives disclosed include nutrients to enhance the composition of the product fertilizer and clay, diatomaceous earth, and the like which, when added to the soil, improve drainage qualities and improve the soil. Another class of disclosed additives are thickening agents and the like for the fertilizer products themselves. The invention provides an improved process for drying organic wastes. The improvement includes a unique dewatering step in which a mixture of the organic waste and dried material is extruded. This dewatering step reduces the amount of water which must be evaporated in the downstream drying step and therefore reduces the amount of fuel consumed in the drying step. The subject invention includes the steps of admixing an organic waste stream containing more than about 60 wt.% water with a dried solids recycle stream to form a mixing zone effluent stream, partially dewatering the mixing zone effluent stream by extruding it, passing the resultant extrudate into a drying zone and effecting the evaporation of water from the extrudate, separating the effluent of the drying zone to produce a vapor stream and a dried solids stream containing less than about 15 wt.% water, dividing the dried solids stream into two portions, recycling a first portion for admixture with the organic waste stream, and subjecting the second portion of the dried solids stream to finishing operations which produce suitable fertilizer or soil conditioner pellets."
4229202,Wastewater treatment with ultraviolet disinfection and increased capacity,1979-01-29,1,1,"The invention relates to wastewater treatment, and more particularly to an efficient on-site wastewater treatment and disposal method and apparatus utilizing filtration and ultraviolet disinfection. Various systems have been used for treatment of residential and other wastes. In cities there have typically been central sewage treatment facilities for water-borne solid and liquid wastes conducted thereto from residences and other sources. Generally these systems have included separation of the solids from the liquids, sometimes by settlement and sometimes by filtration. However, separation at this stage is only partially effective, since the solids and liquids have become nearly homogenized in transit. Such """"separated"""" solids have often been subsequently subjected to a drying operation. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,736,434 and 3,559,807. The liquids from such sewage treatment, which at this point carry many substances from the solids, have usually been chemically treated to the point that they can be returned to the soil or to flowing water. The solids have generally been either buried or composted. Composting of sewage solids at this stage is nearly always anaerobic, since anaerobic decomposition has already begun as the wastes have travelled through sewage lines to the treatment facility. This precludes aerobic composting, which often is desirable and feasible, for producing a useful compost without contaminating the surrounding air. One type of on-site sewage filtration apparatus has been suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 3,747,766. That apparatus was intended to separate solid wastes from liquid wastes soon after their exit from households or other sources. However, the system of the patent was completely closed, with no provision for aerobic composting of solids. The final treatment of the solids was to be dehydration and/or burning. This type treatment is not only costly but also wasteful of the soil conditioning product that can be derived from aerobic composting. The aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,559,807 discloses a conveyor-type filtering device which is in some respects similar to a filtering apparatus of the present invention. However, the filtering device of that patent does not include several particularly advantageous features of the present invention, and it is shown for use with solid material drying and burning apparatus. In connection with filtration sewage treatment, there has been a need for an efficient and inexpensive means of disinfecting the liquid filtrate, without destruction of nutrients, so that with minimal treatment it can be dispersed to soil as a beneficial supplement. There has been a need for an efficient, compact, and reliable wastewater separation and treatment apparatus in several areas of application in addition to sewage treatment. For example, in the food processing industry large quantities of water bearing organic materials must be separated from such materials at least to the point that the water can be safely returned to the soil. Similar problems exist with other industrial water-borne wastes. In industrial air pollution reduction equipment, solid pollutants are often ultimately carried by water. This water should be separated from the solids and purified before it is introduced to the soil or flowing water. The invention described herein is an on-site wastewater treatment and disposal system adaptable for many liquid separation applications, and particularly suited for sewage treatment for private dwellings or groups of dwellings. The basic principles of the invention are as follows: While the wastewater or sewage is still fresh, solids are immediately separated from the wastewater input by a paper filter which is dispensed by a sequentially advanced continuous roll, formed into an input trough and exhausted of its filtrate by a suction applied from below. The trapped solids and paper filter are conveyed to a composting area where they are allowed to decompose by natural biological processes. The filtrate is exposed to ultraviolet radiation to kill organisms directly and also preferably to produce ozone in the filtrate, for reaction with organisms to produce harmless, stable compounds. The disinfected filtrate is applied to unsaturated ground, beneficially adding nitrogen to the soil. By the means disclosed, a number of unique and highly beneficial results are obtained over previous wastewater processing systems: Solids are removed soon after their entry into the wastewater flow, before significant pathogen growth and while the solids still have a high degree of structural integrity and have not become """"homogenized"""" with the liquids, which ordinarily happens in prolonged wastewater transit. This immediate filtration with a very efficient disposable filter allows for a highly filtered filtrate virtually free of suspended solids, low in bacteria, easily pumped, and readily disinfected. The almost total extraction of wastewater contaminants with the filter limits the need for process decontamination to a fraction of the original wastewater volume. Thus, unlike conventional sewage treatment processes, no large tanks are needed for biological digestion of contaminants in solution. Composting of the paper with dewatered solids by either aerobic or anaerobic means provides an energy-efficient, non-polluting and reliable method for decontaminating the solids for return to the ecosphere. Where aerobic means are used, sewage solids can be integrated with other organic solid wastes for optimized composting of both. The system lends itself extremely well to the use of ultraviolet radiation to disinfect the liquid filtrate, destroying pathogens and controlling regrowth. The ultraviolet treatment is energy-efficient, since the energy emitted is only used to destroy organisms, and not to enter into energy-absorbing chemical reactions. Conversely, disinfectants which work purely by oxidation, such as chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, and iodine are inefficient in disinfecting effluents with high nutrient content since their chemical energy is largely wasted in reactions with the nutrients. Ultraviolet radiation, unlike chlorine, is highly efficient in killing viruses, even more so than in killing bacteria. The ultraviolet utilized for the invention includes a wavelength effective to directly kill pathogens by destroying the DNA of the organism, known as """"germicidal"""" wavelength ultraviolet. It also preferably includes an ozone-producing wavelength, which acts on the pathogens by a different means: production of ozone from entrained air in the filtrate liquid, resulting in the formation of stable compounds from pathogens, and the addition of residual hydrogen peroxide to the filtrate to deter pathogen regrowth. The two types of ultraviolet treatment act in concert to disinfect the filtrate more thoroughly and efficiently than the sum of their effects taken separately. The nutrients of the filtrate liquid are left in a form useful as a beneficial soil supplement. Ultraviolet treatment is particularly advantageous with this system because the filtration employed removes nearly all suspended solids, unlike settling processes, making the filtrate clearer and permitting more thorough penetration of the ultraviolet light, resulting in more efficient treatment of the filtrate. Also, the apparatus and method of the invention provide for the ultraviolet treatment immediately after filtration, before growth of organisms and turbidity can occur, and while there is significant entrained air in the filtrate for the production of ozone. This also provides for treatment at a location where the liquid flow rate is slow, for better irradiation. Suction applied to the filtration further increases entrained air in the filtrate, enhancing ozone production. The dissolved solids present in the disinfected filtrate, in the case of sewage, are primarily phosphates, alkyl benzyl sulfonates and organic nitrogen compounds, all of which are readily and productively absorbed by vegetation through the assistance of microorganisms. Nitrogen present in urine, which constitutes over 80% of the nitrogen in human waste, is preserved by this process in a liquid fertilizer; other aerobic and composting systems dissipate most of this nitrogen to the atmosphere as ammonia gas. The disinfected filtrate, being virtually free of suspended solids and thoroughly disinfected, can be readily transported by narrow diameter pressurized pipe and dispersed to unsaturated ground through trickle irrigation, spray irrigation, or furrow irrigation with little danger of soil clogging or orifice clogging. This system, unlike many proposed on-site processing systems, can be installed into existing homes without changing any of the existing plumbing fixtures. Both sanitary and washing wastewaters are processed with no need for separate handling of the two. The system may also be easily installed at existing industrial sites for separating and treating non-sewage wastewaters bearing solids. In fact, it is highly adaptable to the food processing industry, where organic materials are carried in wastewater, and also to the reclamation of water from polluted-air cleansing """"scrubbers"""" which pick up solids from the air they cleanse. For new homes, the installation of the on-site system can save considerably in piping costs. Thus, in one embodiment the process of the invention comprises separating the solids from the liquids while the sewage is fresh, and producing a liquid component low in suspended solid material; exposing the liquid component to ultraviolet radiation including germicidal wavelength, to destroy pathogens but not beneficial nutrients present in the liquid component; introducing ozone in the liquid component to react with pathogens to form stable compounds and to produce residual hydrogen peroxide for deterring subsequent pathogen growth; and dispersing the nutrient-rich treated liquid component to unsaturated ground. In another embodiment, the invention has certain modifications to a wastewater delivery subsystem, whereby filtration and pump operation are made continuous and the capacity of the system is approximately doubled. The modification involves duplication of a few tank and valve components, increasing cost and space requirements less than 20 percent. In addition, the system is readily adaptable to a modular arrangement whereby the capacity may be doubled simply by adding a few modular components and adjusting the control sequence. Thus, according to the second embodiment, the process of the invention comprises a continuous filtration process involving duplicate filtrate or power reservoirs, including pumping stored filtrate from the first reservoir to create a suction; connecting that reservoir with the holding or buffer tank to draw a charge of wastewater into the holding tank; releasing the charge to the filter medium; disconnecting the first reservoir from the holding tank and connecting it to the filtrate side of the filter medium to apply suction thereto and draw filtrate into the first reservoir; while filtration proceeds, pumping stored filtrate from the second reservoir to create a suction therein; connecting the second reservoir to the holding tank and drawing a second charge of wastewater thereto; releasing the second charge to the filter medium; while filtration continues, disconnecting the second reservoir from the holding tank and switching the filtrate side of the medium from the first to the second tank as a source of suction; and thence repeating the cycle. Accordingly, some of the objects of the invention are as follows: (1) To provide a means for conveying wastewater to a filtration station and filtering through a paper filter; (2) To provide a hydraulic/pneumatic subsystem consisting of one pump, several reservoirs, and several inexpensive valves to supply storage of incoming wastewater, pneumatic lift of wastewater to the paper filter, suction to the filtrate side of the filter, and hydraulic pressure for the treated liquid; (3) To provide efficient ultraviolet treatment of the liquid filtrate, soon after filtration, for complete disinfection of the filtrate with minimal energy requirements; and (4) To provide for continuous filtration and approximate doubling of the system's capacity where desired, through addition of modular, interchangeable components. These and other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the drawings."
4366926,Irrigation emitter unit,1980-07-22,1,1,"This invention relates to in-line emitter units for use in drip level irrigation systems. As used in the present specification the term """"in-line emitter unit"""" denotes an emitter unit having end portions adapted to connect together two successive lengths of irrigation conduit so that irrigation liquid flows through the conduit and emitter unit in series, a portion of the liquid emerging from each emitter unit as a substantially pressureless drip. Known in-line emitter units of the kind are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,420,064, 3,604,728 and 3,667,687. It is well known that the output flow rate of emitter units of all kinds are sensitive to flow pressure variations in the irrigation conduits and, in order at least to limit the effect of such flow pressure variations on the output rates, various proposals have been made to provide emitter units with pressure control means. Examples of such proposals are, for example, to be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,767,124, 3,814,377, 3,841,349, 3,882,892 and 4,132,365 and in the Applicants' U.S. Pat. No. 4,209,133. It is an object of the present invention to provide an in-line emitter unit wherein means are provided for stabilizing the outflow rate of the emitter unit with respect to pressure variations in the irrigation conduit in which it is coupled. According to the present invention there is provided an in-line emitter unit comprising a tubular connector member having end portions adapted to connect together two successive lengths of irrigation conduit, a well structure formed integrally with an outer wall portion of the connector member, an inlet formed in said outer wall portion serving to effect communication between the interior of the tubular connector and the well structure, a cover member adapted to be fitted into the well structure, an elongated groove formed in an inner wall of the cover member, a recessed cavity formed in said inner wall and communicating with one end of the groove and being of extended dimensions as compared with the width of the groove, an outlet bore constituting a unit outlet and formed coaxially in a base portion of the cavity and having a rim area substantially less than that of the cavity, a resiliently flexible membrane located in the well structure and juxtaposed with respect to the inner wall so as to define with said groove a flow restricting flowpath, a second and opposite end of said groove communicating with the interior of the well structure; the arrangement being such that the membrane is displaceable towards and away from the cavity in accordance with pressure variations so as to stabilize the output rate of the emitter unit with respect to the variations."
5256424,Stabilized thiocarbonate solutions,1991-05-31,1,1,"This invention relates to the field of stabilized thiocarbonate compositions and, in particular, to stabilized, aqueous thiocarbonate solutions and to methods of using such compositions. Among the more economically serious plant parasites are nematodes, which are roundworms, comprising as many as 10,000 species, of which at least 150 are known to adversely affect plant life. Plant parasitic nematodes have been known since about the year 1750. Most of the nematodes which cause crop damage do so by feeding on plant roots, and therefore are found primarily in the upper few inches of soil in the roots or in close proximity to the roots. Nematode feeding causes hypertrophy or gall formation, and the evidence of heavy infestation is plant stunting, pale foliage, wilting, and even plant death in extreme cases. Virtually all of the world's crops and ornamental plants can be attacked by parasitic nematodes. Important destructive nematode species include the root knot nematodes which are hosted by tomatoes, alfalfa, cotton, corn, potatoes, citrus and many other crops, the golden nematode of potatoes, the sugar beet cyst nematode and the citrus nematode. These, and a few other species, are described in """"The Soil Pest Complex"""", Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Vol. 3, pages 202-205 (1955). Also described therein is a further complication resulting from nematode infestation, namely a lowered resistance to the effects of plant attack by bacteria and pathogenic soil fungi. Except for small volumes of soil which can be sterilized, it has not been found possible to eliminate nematodes. Parasite populations can, however, be kept at levels which economically permit agricultural operations by soil fumigation, crop rotation using non-hosting plant varieties, and (to a much lesser extent) the development of plants which are resistant to infestation. In many instances, control of nematodes is achieved only by combinations of these techniques, and most control programs have proven quite costly. Another serious problem in agriculture is the attack of plants by pathogenic microorganisms, particularly fungi. Such pathogens are normally controlled by fumigation, prior to crop planting, using broad spectrum biocides, many of which are no longer regarded as environmentally safe. Certain narrow spectrum fungicides are available, but are extremely expensive and lose effectiveness against successive generations of fungi, due to genetic adaptability. Carbon disulfide is the first reported soil fumigant, used in Europe during the 1870's to control the sugar beet nematode. This agent is commercially impractical, however, since very large quantities must be applied, due to its high volatility. Further, the material is quite flammable, reportedly being ignited even by static electricity resulting from pouring the material out of drums. In addition, carbon disulfide possesses a very objectionable odor, and its vapors are toxic to humans. When sold for fumigant use, the carbon disulfide is normally mixed with an inert fire retarding compound, such as carbon tetrachloride, and occasionally also with another fumigant. Typically, these compositions do not contain over about 20 percent by weight of carbon disulfide. In addition to soil uses, carbon disulfide has been proven effective in the fumigation of commodities, as an insecticide, as a rodenticide, and for controlling certain weeds. Numerous compositions possessing nematocidal properties have been developed, including active ingredients such as the polyamines of Santmyer U.S. Pat. No. 2,979,434, the heterocyclic compounds of Hessel U.S. Pat. No. 2,086,907, and various halogenated compounds. Among the useful halogen-containing nematocides are 1,2-dibromoethane, methyl bromide, 3-bromopropyne, 1,2-dichloropropane, ethylene dichloride and others, all of which are quite phytotoxic, therefore restricting their utility to mostly preplant treatments. One compound which enjoyed considerable commercial success is 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), which can be used to control nematodes in soils with growing perennial plants. However, use of this material has been limited due to a finding of undesirable reproductive system effects in workers exposed to the chemical, and the possibility that the compound is a carcinogen. The unavailability of DBCP has been a serious setback to growers of perennial crops, such as grapes, stone fruits and nuts, since these crops experience more severe cumulative nematode population increases, and most replacement soil fumigants are phytotoxic. U.S. Pat. Nos. concerned with the use of DBCP as a soil fumigant include Schmidt No. 2,937,936 and Swezey No. 3,049,472. A further class of materials used to control nematodes includes some thiocarbonates. Bashour U.S. Pat. No. 2,676,129 describes the preparation of lower aliphatic disubstituted trithiocarbonates having the structure as in (1): ##STR1## wherein R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are alkyl radicals having from three to nine carbon atoms. The compounds were dissolved in acetone and added to nematode-infested coils, resulting in control of the nematodes. Other compounds have been reported by Seifter in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,836,532 and 2,836,533, the former relating to the use of sodium and potassium trithiocarbonate, and the latter pertaining to alkali metal and ammonium salts of tetrathioperoxycarbonic acid. Both are described as effective in nematode control. These references state that """"not all carbon disulfide derivatives are effective nematode toxicants."""" Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 2,836,532 points out that sodium trithiocarbonate is unexpectedly superior to potassium trithiocarbonate as a nematocide. The chemistry of thiocarbonic acids and salts has been studied in some detail, as indicated in the papers by O'Donoghue and Kahan, Journal of the Chemical Society, Vol. 89 (II), pages 1812-1818 (1906); Yeoman, Journal of the Chemical Society, Vol. 119, pages 38-54 (1921); and Mills and Robinson, Journal of the Chemical Society, Vol. 1928 (II), pages 2326-2332 (1928). According to O'Donoghue and Kahan, derivatives of thiocarbonic acid were prepared by Berzelius, who reacted aqueous solutions of hydrosulfides with carbon disulfide, the reactions occurring as in (2): EQU 2 KHS+CS.sub.2 .fwdarw.K.sub.2 CS.sub.3 +H.sub.2 S (2) PAL giving unstable solutions which yielded unstable crystalline salts. Other thiocarbonates were prepared and further characterized by O'Donoghue and Kahan. Their paper, at page 1818, reports the formation of ammonium thiocarbonate by reacting liquid ammonia with cold alcoholic thiocarbonic acid, prepared by dropping a solution of """"calcium thiocarbonate"""" into concentrated hydrochloric acid. The """"calcium thiocarbonate"""" utilized by the authors is described as a double salt, including the calcium cation in combination with both hydroxide and trithiocarbonate anions. The noted paper by Yeoman reports the further study of thiocarbonates (called trithiocarbonates therein) and also reports the preparation and properties of perthiocarbonates (or tetrathiocarbonates), derivatives of tetrathiocarbonic acid, H.sub.2 CS.sub.4. Yeoman prepared ammonium trithiocarbonate by saturating an alcoholic ammonia solution with hydrogen sulfide, and then adding carbon disulfide; dry ether was added to precipitate the product salt. Ammonium perthiocarbonate was prepared in a similar manner, except that after reacting the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur was added to form the disulfide, (NH.sub.4).sub.2 S.sub.2 ; adding carbon disulfide immediately precipitated the product. Yeoman states that """"solutions of both ammonium trithiocarbonate and perthiocarbonate are very unstable"""" due to both decomposition to form thiocyanate as a product, and to """"complete dissociation into ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon disulfide."""" Considerable explanation is provided concerning the stability of thiocarbonates, as exemplified by sodium trithiocarbonate and perthiocarbonate. Sodium trithiocarbonate solutions in water are said to remain stable only if oxygen and carbon dioxide are """"rigidly excluded""""; the presence of oxygen causes decomposition to form carbon disulfide and thiosulfates, while carbon dioxide decomposes the solution to give a carbonate and carbon disulfide. Similarly, solutions of sodium perthiocarbonate are reported to be stable for a considerable time in the absence of oxygen, the presence of air causing decomposition into thiosulfate and carbon disulfide, while carbon dioxide decomposes the compound to form a carbonate, elemental sulfur, carbon disulfide, and hydrogen sulfide. The potassium thiocarbonates behave similarly, according to Yeoman. Yeoman also attempted to prepare and characterize the stability of thiocarbonate salts of four of the alkaline earth metals. Yeoman was unable to prepare a """"pure"""" calcium tri- or tetrathiocarbonate, but observed that the double salt of calcium trithiocarbonate that he prepared was more stable (probably because it was less hygroscopic) than the sodium or potassium thiocarbonates. The barium tetrathiocarbonate could not be isolated, although Yeoman believed that it existed in solution. Barium trithiocarbonate was found to be stable, although it was alleged to behave like sodium trithiocarbonate when dissolved in water. The preparation of aqueous solutions of the tri- and tetrathiocarbonate of magnesium and strontium was alleged, but the magnesium thiocarbonates were not characterized. However, the stability of none of the magnesium or strontium salts or solutions was determined. The previously noted paper by Mills and Robinson discusses the preparation of ammonium thiocarbonate by digesting ammonium pentasulfide (obtained by suspending sulfur in aqueous ammonia, then saturating with hydrogen sulfide) with carbon disulfide. A crystalline residue from this digestion was found to be ammonium perthiocarbonate. These authors prepared a """"better"""" ammonium perthiocarbonate product, however, by extracting the ammonium pentasulfide with carbon disulfide in a Soxhlet apparatus. Another serious problem in agriculture is that of low nitrogen use-efficiency, since crops have been found to recover only 30 to 70 percent of the total amount of expensive fertilizer nitrogen which is applied to the soil. Most of the lost nitrogen is due to nitrite and nitrate ions, which are exceptionally mobile in a soil environment, and therefore are readily lost by surface runoff and also by leaching from the plant root zone into deeper soil. Other losses of these ions are due to denitrification, which is reduction to elemental nitrogen or gaseous nitrogen oxides under conditions of limited aeration. In addition to the direct economic losses, these nitrogen forms constitute environmental pollutants when runoff enters surface and ground water systems. Although some nitrogen is applied to soil in the form of nitrate (e.g., ammonium nitrate-containing fertilizers), most nitrogen fertilization is with ammonia, ammonium compounds other than nitrate and urea materials. Ammonium nitrogen is fairly tightly bound by various physical and chemical processes in a soil environment and, therefore, is much less subject to losses. Unfortunately, the bound ammonium nitrogen is also less available to plants. The process of nitrification results in conversion of ammonium ions into nitrate ions. Microbial species known as nitrosomonas oxidize ammonium to nitrate; nitrobacter species oxidize nitrite to nitrate. This more mobile ion is easily taken up by plant roots and is also readily assimilated by plant. In this regard, the nitrification process is desirable, but control of the rate at which conversion occurs has not been easily obtained. Inhibition of nitrification would tend to make the applied nitrogen available to plants over a longer period of time, resulting in an increased plant uptake efficiency. Various compositions have been offered as inhibitors of nitrification, including expensive organic materials such as 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine, 2-amino-4-chloro-6-methyl-pyrimidine, sulfathiazoles, alkanolysulfathiazoles, and others. A paper by J. M. Bremner and L. G. Bundy in Soil Biology and Biochemistry, Vol. 6, pages 161-165 (1974) describes the efficacy of various volatile organic sulfur compounds, including methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, carbon disulfide, and hydrogen sulfide. Carbon disulfide in very small amounts is described as having """"a remarkable inhibitory effect on nitrification of ammonium in soils incubated in closed systems."""" Carbon disulfide was tested in the field by J. Ashworth et al., Chemistry and Industry, Sep. 6, 1975, pages 749-750, and found to be effective as a nitrification inhibitor. Hawkins, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,078,912, describes the use of sodium, potassium and ammonium trithiocarbonates, and of xanthates, either alone or in fertilizer mixtures, to inhibit nitrification; the mode of operation is attributed to a release of carbon disulfide by the compounds. One additional potential problem, which could be presented to the agricultural industry in the very near future, is the los of the widely used, effective fumigant, 1,2-dibromoethane, i.e. ethylene dibromide (EDB), due to environmental concerns. This agent is approved for use on the same crops as is carbon disulfide, and is additionally used extensively in chambers for fumigating fruits and vegetables to control various insects. In view of the above, it is clear that the chemical behavior of the alkaline earth metal thiocarbonate salts is unpredictable. Moreover, it is clear that there is no method taught in the art for preparing either the trithio- or tetrathio-salt of calcium. While aqueous solutions of thiocarbonates provide a method for delivering and using equivalent carbon disulfide in a much safer form than is the use of carbon disulfide, per se, both the dilute and concentrated, aqueous thiocarbonate solutions have significant carbon disulfide vapor pressures with the consequence that significant CS.sub.2 concentrations can occur in the equilibrium vapor space overlying such solutions. For instance, we have found that a stoichiometric, aqueous solution of sodium trithiocarbonate in a concentration corresponding to 12.9 weight percent equivalent carbon disulfide has a CS.sub.2 vapor pressure corresponding to an equilibrium CS.sub.2 concentration in the vapor phase of 27 volume percent at 24.degree. C. The somewhat more stable stoichiometric, aqueous solution of sodium tetrathiocarbonate, also containing about 12.9 weight percent equivalent CS.sub.2, has a vapor pressure corresponding to approximately 14 volume percent CS.sub.2 in the vapor phase overlying the solution at 24.degree. C. Such compositions can be very hazardous, particularly in view of the fact that the explosive range of carbon disulfide in air is from 1 to 50 volume percent; i.e. an air-CS.sub.2 mixture having a CS.sub.2 concentration between 1 and 50 volume percent is explosive. In addition, CS.sub.2 is very toxic, and the presence of such high volumes of CS.sub.2 in the vapor phase results in significant loss of active, equivalent CS.sub.2 in the aqueous solution. Significant CS.sub.2 vapor pressures also can occur over more dilute, stoichiometric thiocarbonate solutions. A need exists for a fluid which can release carbon disulfide for fumigation and nitrification inhibiting purposes, but which can be stored and handled safely and without significant loss of effectiveness during a reasonable commercial storage and delivery cycle. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a stabilized liquid composition which can be caused to release fumigants, including carbon disulfide. It is a further object to provide a stabilized composition which is miscible with water to form a fumigant and nitrification inhibitor which can be applied to soils by means of fluid handling equipment or introduced into irrigation water. Another object as a provision of concentrated and dilute, aqueous thiocarbonate solutions having reduced CS.sub.2 vapor pressures useful for industrial and agricultural applications. Other objects and advantages of the instant invention will be apparent from a careful reading of the specification below. The invention is directed to the fumigation of soils, enclosed spaces, agricultural products and other commodities, etc., using compositions which decompose to form carbon disulfide and certain other biocidal materials. Such fumigation can be used to control bacteria, fungi, insects, nematodes, rodents, and weeds, all of which are included herein in the term """"pests,"""" and it can be used to inhibit nitrification. Fumigant compositions are described herein as """"thiocarbonates,"""" including, without limitation, salts of trithiocarbonic acid and tetrathiocarbonic acid, compositions having empirical formulae intermediate to these acid salts (such as MCS.sub.3.7, wherein M is a divalent cation), and compositions containing substances in addition to thiocarbonates [such as a stabilized ammonium tetrathiocarbonate which contains ammonium sulfide, i.e., (NH.sub.4).sub.2 CS.sub.4 (NH.sub.4).sub.2 S]. Stabilized, aqueous thiocarbonate solutions useful for industrial and agricultural applications are also provided which contain an amount of added base sufficient to reduce the vapor pressure of carbon disulfide in the solution. Alternatively, the compositions can contain an amount of added sulfide and/or polysulfide sufficient to reduce the carbon disulfide vapor pressure of the solution, and compositions are also provided which contain combinations of added base and added sulfide and/or polysulfide. Thus, the stabilized aqueous thiocarbonate solutions of this invention involve aqueous solutions of thiocarbonates, soluble in the solution, and having the general formula A.sub.a CS.sub.b wherein A is a mono- or divalent cation, b is 3 to 4, a is 2 when A is a monovalent cation, and a is 1 when A is a divalent cation, and a base and/or a sulfide and/or polysulfide of the formula M.sub.n S.sub.x wherein M is selected from mono- and divalent cations, and combinations thereof, x is at least 1, n is 2 when M is a monovalent cation, and n is 1 when M is a divalent cation. The aqueous solutions can comprise mixtures of tri- and tetrathiocarbonates having the same or different cations as well as mixtures of sulfides and polysulfides of the same or different cations. The compositions are generally water soluble and can be prepared, stored, and used in aqueous solutions. Thiocarbonate solutions of the invention are stable during prolonged periods of storage in a closed container, exhibit a low vapor pressure, and are not flammable. For soil fumigation, thiocarbonates can be mixed with fertilizers to provide a multi-functional application."

Field of the Invention This invention relates to the field of herbicidal compositions and particularly to systemic herbicidal compositions and methods for using such compositions to control vegetation. 2. Description of the Art The unique herbicidal properties of glyphosate and several of its more soluble salts are renowned. As reported by Grossbard and Atkinson in """"The Herbicide Glyphosate,"""" Butterworths, Boston, 1985, and by J. E. Franz in U.S. Pat. No. 3,799,758, glyphosate is a broad spectrum, nonselective, post-emergent herbicide having high unit activity on a wide variety of both annual and perennial plants. It can be manufactured and applied as glyphosate per se or any one of a very broad variety of glyphosate derivatives and homologues which, according to Franz, include halogen; hydroxy; thio; ammonium; mono- and di-alkylamine; hydroxy-alkyl and alkenyl amine, hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbonoxyhydrocarbyl, halohydrocarbyl, and halo-hydrocarbonoxyhydrocarbyl esters and thioesters; aminohydrocarbyl; metallo-oxy including alkali and alkaline earth, copper, zinc, manganese and nickel-oxy; amminoxy; organic amminoxy; and/or strong acid salt derivatives and homologs. According to Franz, supra, the alkali, alkaline earth, ammonium and organic amine salts are preferred. The isopropylamine salt is marketed by Monsanto Chemical Company as Roundup.sup.R. According to Grossbard et al., supra, when glyphosate is contacted with plant foliage, it is translocated to the plant roots, rhyzomes, and apical meristemes giving it its systemic property and resulting in the total destruction of many resistant perennial weeds such as rhyzome sorghum halepense, Agropyron repens, Cirsium arvense, Cyprus spp., C. dactylon, and others. Glyphosate, per se, has relatively broad herbicidal utility since it is active on a variety of vegetation. It is systemic, non-persistent, and is readily metabolized by soil microorganisms to form plant nutrients, including phosphoric acid, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. Thus, glyphosate is environmentally attractive in comparison to many alternative herbicides. For these reasons, glyphosate-containing herbicides are marketed in over 100 countries and are used to control undesired vegetation in crop lands, plantations, orchards, industrial and recreational areas, and for home use. As with all things in nature, however, there is always room for improvement. While glyphosate is a very active, broad spectrum, systemic, relatively environmentally safe herbicide, its solubility in water at 25.degree. C. is only 1.2 weight percent and many of its homologues and salts are only slightly soluble or are essentially insoluble in water and organic solvents. For instance, Franz illustrated that the glyphosate-hydrochloric acid """"salt"""" is essentially insoluble in either water or tetrahydrofuran. Glyphosate is expensive and, when applied at recommended dosages as the isopropylamine salt, it does not completely control all plant species and maximum control does not occur for 1 to 3 weeks depending on plant species, dosage, etc. Moreover, many of the organic amine salts preferred by Franz have negative environmental effects which are not exhibited by the parent compound itself. For instance, the isopropylamine salt is toxic to fish and is not approved, at least not in the United States, for use on aquatic vegetation. The active portion of the molecule in the deliverable (water soluble) compounds----the glyphosate segment----is relatively chemically unstable even in weakly basic environments. Thus, glyphosate is hydrolyzed in weak base which may account for its failure to control vegetation in some instances. Mineral dust which accumulates on vegetation is generally alkaline, and hydrolysis which can occur in that environment (presumably at the amide link in the compound) deactivates glyphosate as a herbicide. Several investigators have found that the herbicidal activity of glyphosate and its compounds can be increased in certain respects by formulation with other compounds. For instance, Grossbard and Atkinson, supra, report at page 226, that, under suitable conditions, ammonium salts, such as ammonium sulfate, can increase the phytotoxicity of a variety of water-soluble leaf-applied herbicides, including certain water-soluble glyphosate derivatives. According to Grossbard et al., these effects are evident particularly when ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate are combined with the appropriate surfactant (ibid., page 228). The effects of several other compounds have also been investigated. For instance, Grossbard et al., report, at page 229, that ammonium salts other than ammonium sulfate have shown improved herbicidal effects in isolated studies and that those effects are less than have been observed in other instances with ammonium sulfate. They also report that, in one test on C. rotundas, slight improvement in glyphosate activity was observed upon addition of urea to the formulation. Other investigators have studied the relative effects of hydrophilic and lipophilic surfactants in the presence or absence of other components such as ammonium salts (Grossbard et al., ibid., page 228). Polybasic acids such as orthophosphoric and oxalic acids reportedly have shown improvement for the control for Agropyron repens when used in combination with certain soluble glyphosate derivatives (Grossbard et al., supra, page 230). While the precise mode of action of the previously tested ammonium salts, surfactants, polybasic acids, and other additives is not known with certainty, it has been suggested that certain ammonium salts modify plant membrane permeability but do not appear to directly influence translocation, while the polybasic acids may improve activity of the isopropylamine salt by sequestering and/or immobilizing metals such as calcium (ibid, page 230). However, the herbicidal effectiveness, per se, of glyphosate compounds and compositions, according to Franz, is not affected by the type of salt, i.e., the glyphosate counter-ion. Thus, in the chapter dealing with the discovery, development, and chemistry of glyphosate published by Grossbard et al., supra, Franz states that """"[a]fter penetration into leaf tissue, therefore, glyphosate exists in the apoplast primarily in its monoanionic form and is translocated via the phloem as the dianion. The similar herbicidal effectiveness of glyphosate acid and many of its soluble salts . . . indicates that the counter-ion may influence formulation solubility but not overall biological activity."""" (Grossbard et al., supra, p. 9) Briefly, the invention provides novel liquid, water-soluble, herbicidal combinations of glyphosate, or its derivatives, and sulfuric acid and/or combinations of glyphosate, sulfuric acid and chalcogen compounds of the formula R.sub.1 --CX--R.sub.2 where X is oxygen or sulfur, R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are independently selected from hydrogen, monovalent organic radicals, NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 and NR.sub.5 wherein R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are independently selected from hydrogen and monovalent organic radicals and R.sub.5 is a divalent organic radical, provided that at least one of R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 is NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 or NR.sub.5. These combinations contain (or form upon evaporation of solvent) reaction products of glyphosate, or its derivatives, and sulfuric acid and/or of glyphosate, sulfuric acid and the defined chalcogen compounds. The invention also provides novel methods for controlling vegetation with such compositions. These compositions possess many advantages in comparison to glyphosate and its homologs and derivatives, including the metal and amine salts preferred by Franz, supra, and the commercially available, water soluble organic amine salts (e.g., Roundup). The sulfuric acid-containing combinations are much more soluble than glyphosate, and they are substantially more chemically stable, less toxic, less costly to manufacture, and more active on a wider variety of vegetation than the amine salts such as the isopropylamine salt. The glyphosate-sulfuric acid and glyphosate-sulfuric acid-chalcogen compound compositions may be either solids or liquids, and concentrated liquid systems can be produced which contain only glyphosate and sulfuric acid and which are solvent-free, completely stable at room temperature, and miscible with water or other polar solvents in all proportions. Thus, they eliminate the need for toxic, expensive organic amine derivatives, such as the isopropylamine salt, which can be toxic to the environment and to animals such as fish. Yet they provide concentrated, water-soluble, chemically stable, fast-acting, broad spectrum, non-caustic, herbicidal formulations which easily can be manufactured, shipped, stored and applied. Thus, these compositions and methods reduce the expense and the environmental and health hazards involved in plant control by reducing the cost and toxicity of the herbicidal agent and the quantity of material which must be applied. It also has been found that glyphosate attenuates several properties of sulfuric acid, including its corrosivity. The novel compositions are faster acting and broader spectrum herbicides, and they provide rapid, thorough control of species not adequately controlled by the organoamine-glyphosate formulations. In effect, they broaden the range of species on which the glyphosate component is active. In particular, the compositions of this invention are more active for the control of broad leaf plants than are other glyphosate-containing formulations. They are also more chemically stable than other compositions containing glyphosate since they minimize the activity loss which otherwise results from hydrolysis of the glyphosate unit under alkaline conditions which may exist on dusty plant foliage, in application equipment, and in water used for dilution. The chemical stability and apparent potentiation of glyphosate in the novel compositions may be due, in part, to direct potentiation of glyphosate activity by the acid and urea components and to the resistance to base hydrolysis which may be imparted by the sulfuric acid component. While sulfuric acid apparently potentiates glyphosate's herbicidal activity and improves its chemical stability and solubility, the glyphosate component, in effect, tames the acid by attenuating its corrosivity and reactivity to equipment, personnel, and clothing. For instance, while the 1/1 glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio reaction product contains 36 weight percent sulfuric acid, it does not immediately burn skin or char clothing as would aqueous solutions containing an equivalent amount of free sulfuric acid. Due to these and other advantageous characteristics, the glyphosate-sulfuric acid-containing compositions of this invention reduce the expense involved in vegetation control; they are easier to handle, store, ship, and apply. They are less toxic to the environment, and impart less residue in crops due to their higher specific activity. The herbicidal compositions of this invention involve combinations of sulfuric acid and glyphosate [N-(phosphono-methyl)glycine] and of sulfuric acid, glyphosate, and chalcogen compounds of the formula R.sub.1 --CX--R.sub.2 where X is oxygen or sulfur, R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are independently selected from hydrogen, monovalent organic radicals, NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 and NR.sub.5 wherein R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are independently selected from hydrogen and monovalent organic radicals and R.sub.5 is a divalent organic radical, provided that at least one of R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 is NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 or NR.sub.5. These combinations contain (or form upon evaporation of solvent) reaction products of glyphosate, or its derivatives, and sulfuric acid and/or of glyphosate, sulfuric acid and the described chalcogen compounds. The methods involve the control of vegetation with such compositions. It has been found that sulfuric acid is capable of reversibly reacting with glyphosate and with combinations of glyphosate and the described chalcogen compounds under certain reaction conditions, and that glyphosate reaction products of sulfuric acid can be formed. Under appropriate conditions, as described herein, the glyphosate-chalcogen compound reaction product with sulfuric acid, which contains one mole of each of the three constituents, can also be formed. Application of any one or a combination of these constituents to plant foliage rapidly and effectively controls the treated plant. Surprisingly, concentrated sulfuric acid, a strong Lowry-Bronsted acid and very strong dehydrating agent, does not dehydrate the glyphosate component as it does sugars and many other organic compounds. Nor does it react with glyphosate to form a crystalline, water-insoluble salt as reported by Franz, for concentrated hydrochloric acid. The 1/1 glyphosate/sulfuric acid reaction product is a water-soluble, chemically and physically stable, non-corrosive, non-toxic liquid at ambient conditions. The 2/1 glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 and 1/1/1 glyphosate/chalcogen compound/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar products are very soluble in water at ambient conditions, and they are also chemically and physically stable, non-toxic, non-corrosive liquids. Sulfuric acid-glyphosate reaction products which contain 2 moles of sulfuric acid per mole of glyphosate as well as those which contain 3 moles of sulfuric acid per mole of glyophosate can also be formed. Excess sulfuric acid may also be present, although such combinations are presently less preferred due to their higher corrosivity. In contrast, combinations of glyphosate and hydrochloric acid form water-insoluble, corrosive, toxic, chemically unstable mixtures which gradually evolve hydrogen chloride, ultimately leaving only glyphosate. Without intending to be constrained to any particular theory, the sulfuric acid reaction products with glyphosate or with glyphosate and the chalcogen compounds may contain one or more combinations of the reactants including (1) adducts of sulfuric acid and glyphosate or of sulfuric acid, glyphosate, and the chalcogen compound, (2) the N-sulfonic acid glyphosate, (3) N-phosphonomethyl-N-sulfonomethyl amine, and/or (4) the sulfate or bisulfate of glyphosate in which the glyphosate molecule is protonated with one or two hydrogens to form the corresponding cation which then associates with the bisulfate or sulfate anion, respectively. The sulfuric acid adducts, the N-sulfonic acid derivatives, and the N-phosphonomethyl-N-sulfonomethyl amine derivatives, when present, may also be protonated in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid to form the corresponding sulfate and/or bisulfate salts. The diglyphosate adduct of sulfuric acid is illustrated schematically by the following structural formula: ##STR1## A similar structure is believed to prevail for the glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid adduct in which the chalcogen atom of the chalcogen compound is associated with the acid sulfur atom. The mono-glyphosate adduct of sulfuric acid is presently believed to have a structure similar to that illustrated with only one glyphosate molecule being associated with each sulfuric acid molecule. The N-sulfonic acid derivative is presently believed to have the structural formula: ##STR2## while the N-phosphonomethyl-N-sulfonomethyl amine is believed to have the following structural formula: ##STR3## The bisulfate salt, when present, is believed to have the structural formula: ##STR4## and the sulfate salt is believed to have a structure similar to that of the bisulfate salt in which the second proton from sulfuric acid protonates the glyphosate molecule, probably at the phosphonic acid group, to form the corresponding divalent cation associated with a sulfate anion. Protonated salts of the adducts, N-sulfonic acid, and N-phosphonomethyl-N-sulfonomethyl amine, when present, are believed to be protonated and associated with bisulfate or sulfate anions in a manner similar to that illustrated for the bisulfate and sulfate salts of glyphosate. The optional chalcogen-containing compounds which also can be employed in these formulations have the empirical formula: ##STR5## wherein X is oxygen or sulfur and R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 are independently selected from hydrogen, monovalent organic radicals, NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 and NR.sub.5, with at least one of R.sub.1 and R.sub.2 being NR.sub.3 R.sub.4 or NR.sub.5. R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are independently selected from hydrogen and monovalent organic radicals, and R.sub.5 is a divalent organic radical. When R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, and/or R.sub.4 are monovalent organic radicals, such radicals can include, for instance, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkenylaryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, or alkynyl, which can be substituted or unsubstituted with pendant functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, oxide, thio, thiol, or others, and they can contain heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or others. R.sub.5 can be any divalent organic radical such as alkdyl, ardyl, alkendyl, alkyndyl, aralkdyl, aralkendyl, etc., which may contain pendant atoms or substituents and/or heteroatoms as described for R.sub.3 and R.sub.4. Preferably, R.sub.3 and R.sub.4 are hydrogen or hydrocarbyl radicals which, in combination, contain about 10 carbon atoms or less, and X is preferably oxygen. Such substituents are presently preferred due to their relatively higher chemical stability. Particularly preferred chalcogen-containing compounds include urea, thiourea, formamide, and combinations of these. Essentially any proportions of glyphosate and sulfuric acid can be employed, it being essential only that a sufficient quantity of each constituent is present to obtain a herbicidally effective amount of one or more of the glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products. It has been found that the glyphosate-sulfuric acid and glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid reaction products are more soluble and more herbicidally active than glyphosate alone and that such adducts control a broader range of vegetation than does glyphosate or the organoamine glyphosate salts such as the isopropylamine salt. Accordingly, the compositions of this invention can contain only minor amounts of one or more of the described reaction products in the presence or absence of excess glyphosate or sulfuric acid. As a rule, however, a substantial proportion of the glyphosate and sulfuric acid is present as one or more of such reaction products. Accordingly, the glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio will usually be at least about 0.1, generally at least about 0.5. Compositions having glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratios of 0.5 contain (or form upon evaporation of solvent from dilute solutions) 50 percent of the sulfuric acid as the mono-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction product. The glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio is generally below about 10, usually below about 5 and preferably about 2 or less. Molar ratios of 2 connote the di-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products. Most compositions will have glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratios within the range of about 0.1 to about 10, preferably about 0.1 to about 2. The mono-glyphosate-sulfuric acid composition, e.g., the reaction product of one mole of each reactant, is presently preferred since it can be prepared, stored, shipped, and applied as a liquid and in the absence of any solvent. This product is a stable liquid at 70.degree. F., and it contains 63.3 weight percent glyphosate and 36.7 weight percent sulfuric acid which correspond to a glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio of one. The di-glyphosate sulfuric acid reaction product is a solid under ambient conditions and can be manufactured, shipped, and stored as such. It is soluble in water at 70.degree. F. to the extent of approximately 60 weight percent and can also be manufactured, stored, and shipped in that form. Compositions which have glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratios above 1 and below 2 connote those which contain a combination of the mono- and di-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products. Reaction products which are presently preferred, particularly for manufacture and/or use as concentrates containing, for example, 5 weight percent or more of the combination of glyphosate and sulfuric acid, have glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratios of about 1/3 to about 1/1. Within this molar ratio range, stable, noncorrosive liquid compositions and concentrated solutions can be obtained. When the glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio is increased much above 1/1 in concentrated liquids or solutions, a solid phase tends to precipitate. When the molar ratio is reduced much below 1/3 (i.e., 3 moles of sulfuric acid per mole of glyphosate), the combinations can become corrosive indicating that the oxidizing and dehydrating activities of sulfuric acid are not completely attenuated by glyphosate. The novel compositions also include combinations which contain one of the described chalcogen compounds in addition to glyphosate and sulfuric acid. The presence of the chalcogen compound results in the formation of the glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid reaction product which contains one mole of each of the three constituents. This three-component reaction product can be present in combination with the mono- and/or di-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products depending upon the respective molar ratios of the three constituents. Very minor amounts of the chalcogen compound relative to glyphosate and sulfuric acid can be employed. However, when the chalcogen compound is employed, the chalcogen compound/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio will usually be at least about 0.1, generally at least about 0.5, preferably about 0.5 to below 2, and most preferably about 1. Thus, the most preferred chalcogen compound-containing compositions are those which contain one mole of each of the three constituents: glyphosate, chalcogen compound, and sulfuric acid. The presence of the mono- and or di-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products and of the glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid reaction products has been established by several observations. For instance, glyphosate, which is soluble in water only to the extent of 1.2 weight percent at 25.degree. C., dissolves in concentrated (100%) sulfuric acid to the extent of 63.3 weight percent. Even higher glyphosate concentrations can be achieved by formation of the di-glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction product. Secondly, dissolution of glyphosate in concentrated sulfuric acid produces a significant exotherm indicating that a reaction between glyphosate and sulfuric acid occurs. Furthermore, several of the characteristic chemical activities of sulfuric acid are largely attenuated or are not even evident when the acid is combined with glyphosate. The reaction products do not char cellulose or other materials which are normally attacked by concentrated sulfuric acid. Nevertheless, the sulfuric acid still exists as the acid and has not been neutralized, e.g., by conversion to a Bronsted salt, as evidenced by titration with standard base. The same is true of the chalcogen compound-containing compositions. Addition of one of the described chalcogen compounds to compositions containing glyphosate and sulfuric acid produces an exotherm characteristic of the reaction of urea with sulfuric acid which occurs in the formation of urea-sulfuric acid adducts as discussed in my U.S. Pat. No. 4,445,925, Methods of Producing Concentrated Urea-Sulfuric Acid Reaction Products, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Several of the novel glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products, such as the di-glyphosate product, can be manufactured as solids, while all of the described reaction products can be manufactured and employed as pure liquids or solutions. For instance, the mono-glyphosate product (glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 mole ratio of 1/1) is liquid under ambient conditions in the absence of any solvent, and is miscible in all proportions with water and other polar solvents. The novel reaction products are usually applied to vegetation in liquid form, and such liquids contain herbicidally effective amounts of the glyphosate-acid reaction products. While these reaction products exhibit herbicidal activity at very minor concentrations and dosage rates, the glyphosate is usually present in the composition at a concentration of at least about 0.05 weight percent and preferably at least about 0.1 weight percent. Higher concentrations are usually preferred for manufacture, shipment, and storage. In such compositions, glyphosate concentration will be at least about 10 weight percent, generally, at least about 20 weight percent, preferably at least 30 weight percent, and can even exceed 50 weight percent. As disclosed herein, glyphosate concentrations as high as 63.3 weight percent can be achieved in the liquid compositions. The novel liquid and solid compositions can contain one or more other materials which do not negate the herbicidal activity of the glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction product. Such additional materials typically include surfactants which facilitate foliage wetting and corrosion inhibitors such as those discussed in my U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,402,852, NON-CORROSIVE UREA-SULFURIC ACID COMPOSITIONS, and 4,404,116, NON-CORROSIVE UREA-SULFURIC ACID REACTION PRODUCTS, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Glyphosate can be prepared by the reaction of glycine with chloromethylphosphonic acid as described by J. E. Franz in U.S. Pat. No. 3,799,758, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative schemes for the manufacture of glyphosate are discussed and/or referenced by Grossbard et al., supra. The active glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products can be prepared by adding sulfuric acid to dilute solutions of glyphosate (since glyphosate is not highly soluble) or adding glyphosate to either dilute or concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction of glyphosate and sulfuric acid is highly exothermic. Thus, when concentrated combinations are produced, it is preferable to either cool the reactants or otherwise provide for heat dissipation. While glyphosate is thermally stable at temperatures of up to about 200.degree. C., it is preferable to maintain much lower temperatures in the presence of strong acids, such as sulfuric acid. Thus, it is presently preferred to provide cooling adequate to assure that reaction temperature is maintained at about 70.degree. C. or less, most preferably about 50.degree. C. or less in concentrated systems, e.g., systems in which the glyphosate and sulfuric acid, in combination, constitute at least about 20 weight percent of the combination, and particularly when they constitute more than 40 percent of the composition. Adequate cooling can be provided by ice baths, the use of pre-cooled reactants, the use of a heel of previously prepared material, recirculating cooling systems, gradual addition of glyphosate to the sulfuric acid, or any combination of these. Reaction temperature and reactant and product thermal stability are of less concern in more dilute systems, e.g. systems in which the glyphosate and sulfuric acid constitute less than 20 weight percent of the total composition. Thus, when glyphosate is added to a dilute, e.g. 5 to 10 weight percent, solution of sulfuric acid, gradual addition of glyphosate is usually sufficient to prevent excessive reaction phase temperatures. Glyphosate-sulfuric acid compositions having glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratios of about 1 can be prepared in liquid form at room temperature in the absence of any solvent. Compositions which contain substantial excesses of glyphosate, however, will precipitate or will not dissolve the di-glyphosate reaction product of sulfuric acid and/or excess glyphosate in the absence of diluents such as water or other polar solvents. In such instances, the di-glyphosate product, in the presence or absence of excess unreacted glyphosate, can be separated from the liquid phase and later dissolved in water or other solvent prior to application. The novel glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid herbicides can be prepared by adding the chalcogen compound to preformed glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products, by the simultaneous or sequential addition of the chalcogen compound and glyphosate to sulfuric acid, the addition of sulfuric acid to solutions of the chalcogen compound and glyphosate, or by the addition of glyphosate to pre-formed chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid adducts. When pre-formed glyphosate-sulfuric acid reaction products or chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid reaction products are employed in such preparations, it is presently preferred, although not essential, that the pre-formed material have a glyphosate/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 or chalcogen compound/H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 molar ratio below 2. This proviso will assure the availability of reactive sites on the sulfuric acid for reaction with the third component, e.g., either glyphosate or the chalcogen compound. Methods suitable for preparing urea-sulfuric acid adducts are discussed in my U.S. Pat. No. 4,445,925, supra, and adducts of the other chalcogen compounds described herein can be prepared by those methods. Essentially all varieties of vegetation can be controlled by applying to the foliage a herbicidally effective amount of the glyphosate-sulfuric acid and/or glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid combinations. While very minor dosage rates of the novel combinations deter plant growth, adequate control usually involves the application of sufficient herbicide to either eliminate undesired vegetation or deter its growth. Dosage rates required to accomplish these effects, of course, vary depending on plant type (due to variations in specific plant resistance) and plant size and maturity. More mature plants are generally more resistant to herbicides and require higher dosage rates for a comparable level of control. Useful dosage rates can best be expressed in relation to glyphosate dosage rates and will generally correspond to at least about 0.1 pints glyphosate per acre, preferably at least about 0.2 pints per acre. Dosage rates corresponding to glyphosate dosages of about 0.2 to about 20 pints per acre are generally adequate to control most weeds and brush prevalent in field crop areas. The described glyphosate dosage rates correspond broadly to at least about 1, preferably at least about 2, and usually about 2 to about 200 pounds per acre of the combination of glyphosate and sulfuric acid or glyphosate-chalcogen compound-sulfuric acid (on a solvent-free basis).

5367047,Preparation of polyaspartic acid by high temperature reaction,1994-02-22,1,1,"This invention relates to a process for the production of polyaspartic acid and its salts and the use of these materials. The salts of polyaspartic acid have been used for fertilizers, and scale inhibition agents. They are particularly useful for the prevention of scale deposition in boiler water, reverse osmosis membranes and in detergents. One of the primary characteristics that makes them valuable in this respect is the fact that they are readily biodegradable, whereas other materials that are presently used for this purpose are either slowly biodegradable, e.g. polyacrylic acid, or harmful to the environment, e.g. polyphosphoric acid. Sodium polyaspartate was used in the prevention of boiler scale by changing the crystal structure of calcium salts resulting in the formation of a soft scale (Sarig et al, The use of polymers for retardation of scale formation. Natl Counc Res Dev [Rep] (Isr.), 150, 1977). Polyaspartic acid, molecular weight (MW) 6,000, was found to be superior to polyglutamate, MW 14,400, polyvinyl sulfonate, MW 5300, and polyacrylic acid, MW 6,000, in that it gave 66% retardation of total scale and 90% retardation of calcium sulfate scale. In addition, the scale formed in the presence of polyaspartate was softer than that produced in the presence of polyacrylate, polyglutamate and polyvinyl sulfonate. U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,461 discloses a method for making polyaspartic acid from maleic acid and ammonia by reacting these constituents in a 1:1-1.5 molar ratio by raising the temperature to 120.degree.-115.degree. C. over a period of 4-6 hours and maintaining it for 0-2 hours. It is further disclosed that temperatures above 140.degree.-160.degree. C. result in elimination of CO.sub.2, thus teaching degradation of the material. The molecular weight range obtained by this method was said to be 1,000-4,000 with a cluster at 1,800-2,000. That patent states that this material is useful in the prevention of tarnishing glass and porcelain articles. Although not stated in this patent, it is known that this action would occur as a result of the inhibition of calcium sulfate deposition. Harada, et al (Thermal polycondensation of free amino acids with polyphosphoric acid. Origins Prebiol. systems Their Mol Matrices, Proc. Conf., Wakulla Springs, Fla., 289, 1963) obtained polyaspartic acid from aspartic acid and phosphoric acid at temperatures over 100.degree. C. over a time period of 50-250 hrs, but required temperatures over 170.degree. without phosphoric acid being present. U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,597 discloses a method for the polycondensation of aspartic acid to produce polyaspartic acid by heating the aspartic acid in a fluidized bed reactor to 221.COPYRGT.C. for a period of 3-6 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere followed by conventional alkaline hydrolysis. Kovacs et al. (J. Org. Chem., 25 1084 [1961]) prepared polyaspartic acid by heating aspartic acid to 200.degree. C. in vacuo for a period of 120 hours or in boiling tetralin over a period of 100 hours. Kovacs et al, showed that the intermediate formed in the thermal polymerization of aspartic acid was polysuccinimide. Frankel et al. (J. Org. Chem., 16, 1513 [1951]) prepared polyaspartic acid by heating the benzyl ester of N-carboxyanhydroaspartic acid followed by saponification. Dessaigne (Comp. rend. 31,432-434 [1850]) prepared condensation products which gave aspartic acid on treatment with nitric or hydrochloric acid by dry distillation of the acid ammonium salts of malic fumaric or maleic acid at unspecified times and temperatures. Polymers of aspartic acid which are suitable for the prevention of scale may be obtained by reacting maleic acid and ammonia in a molar ratio of 1:1-2.1 at 200.degree.-300.degree. C. and then converting the polysuccinimide formed to a salt of polyaspartic acid by hydrolysis with a metal hydroxide. The reaction is carried out by the addition of water to maleic anhydride, thus forming maleic acid, or to maleic acid followed by addition of the appropriate amount of ammonia in the form of gaseous ammonia or as its aqueous solution. This solution is then heated to remove water. A melt of the maleic acid and ammonia is formed and water removal continues as the reaction proceeds and the temperature is brought to 200.degree.-300.degree. C. When the theoretical quantity of water formed in the production of polysuccinimide has been removed, which may occur in less than 5 minutes, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool. The polysuccinimide formed can be used to make other useful products or can be hydrolyzed with metal hydroxides to provide the appropriate salt of polyaspartic acid. Solutions of the salts of polyaspartic acid formed in this manner have the same scale inhibition performance and molecular weight range as do the polymers formed by the thermal polymerization of aspartic acid itself. Further manipulation to remove the water or the salts can be carried out to provide water free powders of the salts or the free acid. The polyaspartic acid provided by the present invention is suitable for inhibition of scale deposition, whereas the methods previously used to produce polyaspartic acid did not provide a polymer of sufficient molecular weight to prevent scale formation. The object of this invention is to provide a means of preparing polysuccinimide. A further object of this invention is to provide a means of preparing salts of polyaspartic acid."
5664403,Method for crimping a sleeve about a floral grouping,1994-11-01,1,1,"The present invention relates generally to the wrapping of a floral grouping with a wrapper and crimping at least a portion of the wrapper about the stem portion of the floral grouping whereby the crimped area of the wrapper is bound together with a bonding material. Packers of floral groupings such as bouquets often complain that floral grouping wrappers such as commercially-available """"sleeves"""" are not the correct size at the lower end of the sleeve. Therefore, the packer must use some type of band or tie at the lower end of the sleeve to take up the extra sleeve material and to tightly wrap the sleeve about the stems of the floral grouping to inhibit the bouquet from spreading apart or slipping from the wrapper. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to increase the ease and quickness with which a wrapper can be applied about a floral grouping and held firmly about the stems of the floral grouping without relying on the additional step of applying a separate band or tie about the wrapper, and further to optionally affix an informational label to the wrapper. The present invention is a method for wrapping a floral grouping. One version of the invention comprises providing a floral grouping, and a wrapper. The wrapper may be a floral sleeve or it may be a sheet of material. The wrapper has a crimp connector for firmly holding overlapping portions of the wrapper in a crimped position adjacent the stem portion of the floral grouping. The crimp connector may further comprise a bonding material, or a cinching tab, or both. The floral grouping is placed into the interior space of the wrapper and the wrapper is bound about the floral grouping by crimping portions of the wrapper together with the crimp connector thereby forming a crimped portion of the wrapper and firmly binding the wrapper in a position about the floral grouping. The wrapper may further comprise a closure flap extending from the wrapper for enclosing either the upper end or the lower end or alternatively, both the upper end and lower end of the wrapper. The wrapper may further comprise a label bonding material for affixing a label to a portion of the wrapper. When the wrapper is a sheet of material, the sheet of material may have a sheet connector for connecting overlapping portions of the sheet of material in a conical or cylindrical form about the floral grouping."
5579816,Boom-mounted manipulating grapple,1995-02-01,2,1,"The present invention relates to a rotatable and maneuverable grappling head that may be mounted to a vehicle-mountable boom. Grappling heads mounted to booms serve a variety of mechanized functions. For example, the tree-cutting and delimbing device disclosed in applicant's co-pending application Ser. No. 08/189,644, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,090 discloses a boom-mounted head having a saw mounted thereto, adapted to cut trees and limbs, with the jaws of the head adapted to grapple tree trunks and limbs and loose brush. Another useful function of a grapple is to rotatably drive an auger and, after a hole is drilled, to manipulate and transport a pole for insertion within the hole. Other uses abound. Several features are desirable in a grapple to serve these various functions. The head must be highly maneuverable, and capable of being placed by the boom in virtually any position. It must be able to reach over, under or around obstructions. It should be continuously rotatable, in order to permit it to rotate an auger. The jaws of the head should be capable of evenly gripping either a regular or an irregularly-shaped object, and for this purpose the individual teeth that comprise the jaws should be independently-pivoted and driven by drive means adapted to supply an even force to all teeth regardless of their position. A grappling head is typically are mounted to an articulated, or """"knuckle"""", boom with the boom and head being driven by a hydraulic or other drive means. While knuckle booms and various types of grappling heads are well known in the art, prior such systems suffer from not having a full range of control in all planes, nor are the heads continuously rotatable. Typically, the head in a boom-mounted device comprises a set of jaws adapted to grip an object, with the head having some degree of maneuverability. There may be provided as well a saw for cutting tree or brush. An example is shown in Canadian Patent 1,224,704 (Gaitten), wherein an articulated boom mounted to a truck is provided with a cutting head at its free end. The cutting head includes a set of jaws for gripping a tree limb or trunk, and a longitudinally-slidable circular saw. However, the Gaitten device does not include a boom having a sufficient degree of articulation to reach around or behind obstructions. In order to achieve these objects, the head may be mounted on an articulated boom, with a linkage that permits the head to both pivot and rotate in much the same manner as a human arm and wrist permit the hand to be positioned in any orientation. Preferably, the head should be continuously rotatable relative to the boom; this requires the use of a rotary drive coupling to permit the hydraulic lines or other drive and control means driving the head to remain coupled with the boom without the lines twisting. Preferably, at least one of the segments of the boom should be extensible. As well, one of the joints of the boom may be provided with means to pivot by a full, or nearly full, 360 degrees; this permits an operator to extend the head underneath obstructions, such as power lines, and bring the head upwardly and rearwardly around the obstruction. These and other objects are addressed by the present invention. In its broadest scope, a first aspect of the present invention comprises a gripping and manipulating apparatus that may be rotatably mounted on a vehicle, comprising an articulated boom with a gripping and manipulating head rotatably mounted thereto. The head is provided with a rotary coupling for the continuous rotation of the head relative to the boom, with the coupling comprising an axle housed within an axle housing extending from the head and the boom. The head is further provided with a pivot for pivotal movement of the head relative to the boom. The head may be provided with opposing jaw members comprised of individual teeth, each tooth being independently pivoted and linked to drive means that drive the teeth such that they apply an even pressure to an object being gripped thereby. A drive coupling is preferably provided to provide a continuously rotatable link between hydraulic drive conduits extending along the boom with conduits on the head. The drive coupling comprises a coupling body rotatably housed within a sheath. Hydraulic fluid is transmitted through an aperture extending through the coupling body into a groove between the coupling body and the sheath, with the groove communicating with an aperture extending through the sheath. The sheath aperture communicates with a fluid conduit engaged thereto, which may be linked to a jaw member or other component of the head driven by hydraulic drive means. The invention further comprises a boom-mounted gripping and manipulating head as described above, mounted to a vehicle. A further aspect of the invention is a gripping and manipulating head by itself, as described above, for engagement to a boom. The invention further comprises a segmented boom for use with a gripping and manipulating head. The boom may be provided with a 360 degree pivot link joining two of the segments. The link comprises a rigid link member pivotally engaged at either end thereof to a respective boom segment. Two hydraulic cylinders or other drive means are each pivotally engaged at one end thereof to a respective boom segment and at the other end thereof to an upper and lower articulated mount, respectively, each pivotally engaged to the link member. The boom segments may include an angled portion adjacent the link member to facilitate rotation. A first of said angled portions angles upwardly and a second portion angles downwardly, when viewed from the link member with the boom positioned generally horizontally."
5884224,Mobile mounted remote sensing/application apparatus for interacting with selected areas of interest within a field,1997-03-07,1,1,"This invention relates to a mobile mounted remote sensing/application apparatus for interacting with selected areas of interest within a field. The cultivation of agricultural crops has evolved over the years from the growing of crops on a large number of small family farms to the growing of crops on large scale farms. Irrespective of a farm's size, variations in terrain, soil conditions, and weather exposure can result in non-uniformities of field conditions during the preparation and growing of crops. Individual farmers, who typically do not farm with irrigation equipment on their plots of land have learned to selectively fertilize and harvest each plot according to its specific needs. Pursuant to topological variations, some plots of land are exposed to more sunlight due to the presence of a hillside slope, better exposing the land to rays of light. Similarly, other plots of land can have an overall increased moisture content due to their presence in a valley where water is likely to collect when it rains. Typically, an individual farmer faced with the task of cultivating a small family farm, will consciously be aware of such variations. Hence, the farmer will make decisions to cultivate certain plots of land based upon their personal knowledge of soil conditions and crops being grown on each plot. Such a growing/cultivating strategy is realizable by a small scale farmer who does not have to cultivate a large number of plots of land. In addition to sunlight exposure, individual farmers keep track of rainfall, humidity and temperature, as well as soil conditions and the occurrence of bug infestations. In some cases, soil is analyzed to determine nitrogen levels and various other conditions. In other cases, visual observation is made by a farmer as he walks through a field to detect the presence of bugs or other crop-damaging conditions. However, it is only feasible for a farmer who collects data in such a manner, to grossly categorize such agronomic information when attempting to tailor a farming strategy that maximizes crop yield therefrom. Hence, improvements that enable better collection and management of such information have been needed by individual farmers. Additionally, the trend in agriculture has been an increase in the number of large scale farms that contain vast amounts of land, frequently divided into many plots of land. Many of these farms are run by corporations, or large groups of individuals. Due to the large amount of land being cultivated and the large number of individuals involved in such cultivation, the collection and tracking of detailed knowledge about soil and crop information over all regions of land being cultivated can be lost. Additionally, some large scale farms employ sprinkler irrigation systems for applying water and chemicals to a crop being raised. One type of sprinkler system consists of a center-pivot irrigation device configured to apply water and chemicals to a circular plot of land. Such devices can also be adapted to irrigate square plots of land by providing end features for irrigating corner portions of such a plot via provision of a controllable end gun or articulating end boom contained therealong. A typical center pivot irrigation device has a fixed pivot, and a long body carried by an array of towers having support wheels. A plurality of sprinklers are fixed in spaced-apart relation along the arm, each sprinkler being activated via a solenoid valve to enable turning """"on"""" and """"off"""" of a sprinkler nozzle to regulate application of water and chemicals therefrom. In operation, the arm is rotated about the fixed pivot via the towers, as drive motors on each tower drive the support wheels, causing the device to rotate thereabout. Each sprinkler is activated via the solenoid valve to distribute water at a desired rate. The rate of application depends on the radial location of each particular sprinkler, so as to produce a somewhat uniform distribution of water around the field. Recently, attempts have been made to enable a variable-rate application of water and chemicals to a field in order to deliver water and chemicals to regions of the field in differing amounts. One such effort is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,164 to McCann et al., entitled """"Method and Apparatus for Variable Applications of Irrigation Water and Chemicals"""". A center pivot irrigation device has a plurality of sprinkler assemblies oriented in a fixed array. The array of sprinklers are operable to distribute an adjustable amount of water over a zone of ground as the arm is pivoted about the fixed pivot. An additional area of development in the field of irrigation involves in-ground sprinkler systems that are used to irrigate relatively small plots of land. Typically, such systems consist of irrigation sprinklers that are buried in the landscaped ground surrounding large commercial buildings. Other applications include implementation of such systems on golf courses where maintenance of healthy ground cover is desirable. In one such system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,802 to Iggulden et al., entitled """"Smart Irrigation Sprinklers"""", an irrigation sprinkler is disclosed which has a plurality of moisture sensing probes buried in the soil adjacent each sprinkler head. Each sensing probe is configured to develop an electrical signal representing the moisture content of soil surrounding the probe. Irrigation logic receives information on moisture content, and can compare such information with pre-established limits for preventing the supply of water to a sprinkler head when the ground is already sufficiently moist. However, such systems are impractical for use when farming large plots of land. In-ground systems are not suitable for applications where the ground must be turned over and tilled when preparing a field for the planting of crops. Likewise, in-ground sensors prove impractical because normal harvesting operations will damage or disrupt the placement of such devices. Furthermore, an extremely large number of sensing devices would be required in order to detect information from an entire field. Therefore, such an irrigation implementation on an agricultural field would prove extremely expensive. Furthermore, such a system would only provide a coarse distribution of information, because sensors would have to be spaced apart a rather significant distance in order to provide anything close to a cost-effective data collection implementation. Another area of recent improvement in the field of agriculture involves the use of precision agriculture products. Such products typically utilize variable-rate application devices such as the above-mentioned pivot-end irrigation device, global positioning system (GPS) devices, and geographic information system (GIS). Satellite-based global positioning systems enable the determination of precise locations within a field of interest. Geographical information systems enable data management of detected conditions on a field of interest. One presently available suitable differential global positioning system is manufactured by Trimble, and is sold under the product name Direct GPS for Arc View, Trimble Surveying and Mapping Division, 645 North Mary Avenue, P.O. Box 3642, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94088-3642. One suitable geographic information system (GIS) is presently available from Environmental System Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), 380 New York Street, Redlands, Calif. 92373-8100, under the name """"ARCVIEW.RTM., for Agriculture"""". Such a GIS system enables the management of agricultural information by way of a graphical user interface. The GIS system consists of software loaded into memory and implemented on a computer, and forms a graphical user interface that easily enables a user to tabulate data and evaluate collected data for making decisions about a crop being cultivated. The use of precision agriculture products has been coupled with far-distance data collection techniques for determining certain agronomic features on a field being studied. Satellite imaging techniques and aerial photography techniques have enabled the collection of large amounts of data in order to characterize agronomic information and features on large fields of interest. For example, thermal imaging cameras have been used to determine certain thermal characteristics that manifest themselves on a field being observed. However, such cameras produce a gray scale array of pixels having limited resolution, and further, only collect information periodically when weather conditions permit flight overhead. Such flight-based collection is performed a far distance above a field being monitored. In some circumstances, the presence of certain crop and soil conditions will manifest themselves in the form of a thermally detectable variation upon the land. Similar detection can be performed in the visible, infrared and ultraviolet ranges, enabling the determination of correlated features with such information. However, the ability to collect agronomic information on a field of interest via far-distance detection techniques often-times has limited capabilities. For example, inclement weather conditions can prevent the collection of information by blocking the ability to detect agronomic features. For cases of satellites, even the presence of moderate cloud cover can disrupt detection of such information. During certain periods of a growing cycle for a crop, the detection of such information can be critical to successful harvesting, as well as to the implementation of remedial measures that must be taken in order to counteract the effects of a bug infestation or fungal attack on plants. Hence, an improved technique which enables the detection of such agronomic information during any time of day, and under any type of weather condition, is desired. Furthermore, a sensing device that enables the detection of an increased number of different agronomic features is also desired. Additionally, a detection device that does not harm crops during the detection process, yet enables the collection of agronomic information while crops are being grown, is also desirable. Although a number of precision agriculture products have recently been made available to the farming community, little has been done to enhance the ability to collect large amounts of data in a way which does not interrupt with the preparation and growing of a crop on a field. Therefore, there is a present need to enhance the ability to detect information about soil conditions and crops, while substantially leaving the field uninterrupted during the data collection process. Another presently unresolved problem is a general inability to monitor and evaluate the condition of crops during each growing cycle. Presently, an individual farmer has to selectively sample and/or observe crop characteristics during a growing cycle in order to make projections about yield and productivity. However, such a crop-yield productivity system is dependant heavily upon the number of sample observations made by an observer, as well as the particular location of such sample sights being selected. Therefore, there is a need to improve the monitoring and sampling of crop status and growing conditions in order to better make projections on crop-yield during a particular growing cycle. Such information would prove useful in predicting overall crop yields, as well as making decisions on whether or not a crop surplus is available for selling to particular customers and foreign governments. Therefore, a need has arisen for a system which provides for collection of such agronomic information, and further provides for collection of such information in a format suitable for use with presently available geographic information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS). Hence, there is a need to provide input of such information to crop modeling programs, either on request, or automatically. Yet another presently unresolved problem is a general inability to precisely apply water and/or chemicals locally to specific locations on a field and according to detected needs. More particularly, there is a need to apply water and/or chemicals locally, yet over large plots of land being cultivated, particularly in response to detected needs. Even further, there is a need to combine local detection of agrarian needs and application of water and/or chemicals to meet such needs within a single device capable of detecting needs and/or applying water/chemicals to meet such needs."
6141823,Blower and vacuum device,1997-07-01,1,1,"The present invention relates to a blower-vacuum apparatus, and more particularly, to a type thereof capable of switching between an air blowing blower mode and an air sucking vacuum mode. A conventional blower-vacuum apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,714. According to the disclosed apparatus, an air suction port and an air discharge port are formed in a main body, so that the air suction port is in confrontation with a fan disposed in the main body and the air discharge port is positioned perpendicularly with respect to an axis of the fan. In a vacuum mode, the air suction port is connected to a suction tube (vacuum nozzle) and the air discharge port is connected to a dust bag. By rotation of the fan, air and dust is introduced into the suction tube and directed into the dust bag through the main body. In the blower mode, the suction tube is detached from the air suction port, and a filter is attached to an open end of the air suction port for preventing dust from being introduced into the main body. Further, the dust bag is detached from the air discharge port, and an air blower tube (blower nozzle) having a tapered shape in which a diameter is gradually reduced toward its tip is connected to the air discharge port. Accordingly, air passing through the filter and introduced into the main body is blown outside through the air blower tube. However, each time the blower-vacuum apparatus disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,714 is switched between the vacuum mode and the blower mode, the suction tube and the filter must be exchanged and the dust bag and the air blower tube must be exchanged, which is troublesome. Japanese Utility Model Application laid open publication No. Hei 4-80454 discloses a dust collecting apparatus in which a suction tube (vacuum nozzle) extending in a axial direction of a fan is connected to a main body, and an outlet tube extending in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the fan is connected to a dust bag through a joint. The joint is provided with a branch pipe to which a blower tube (blower nozzle) is connected through a rubber tube. A blower opening of the blower tube is positioned close to a suction opening of the suction tube. Air and dust introduced into the suction tube is directed into the dust bag through the main body, the outlet tube, and the joint. A part of the suction air is also directed to the blower tube through the branch pipe, so that the air is blown to a position close to the opening of the suction tube. Because of this air, rubbish and dust accumulated in indentations on the ground is blown out of the indentations to facilitate suction of the flying rubbish and dust into the suction tube. However, the dust collecting apparatus disclosed in the laid open Utility Model Application publication No. Hei 4-80454 blows air during suction cleaning work so that a part of the suction air sucked through the suction tube is utilized for air blowing. Accordingly, the blowing air may contain dust, thereby lowering the dust-collecting efficiency of the device. Further, the device is not designed to operate in a blower mode only. Japanese Utility Model laid open application publication No. Hei 3-92454 discloses a dust collecting apparatus in which one end of an air feed tube is connected to a blower and another end of the air feed tube is connected to a confluence tube which is connected to a dust bag. The confluence tube includes an air feed passage, a dust suction passage and a branch passage. Further, a pivotable change-over valve is provided in the confluence tube. The air feed passage approximately linearly connects the air feed tube and the dust bag. The dust suction passage branches off the air feed passage and has one end connected to a cleaning tube. The branch passage connects the air feed passage to the dust suction passage. In a vacuum mode, the change-over valve is pivotally moved to a position for closing an opening of the branch passage, so that the air from the blower is directed to the dust bag by way of the air feed tube, and the air feed passage. Because of this air flow, air in the dust suction passage is subjected to sucking, and therefore, the dust is sucked through the top end of the cleaning tube and is collected in the dust bag. In a blower mode, the change-over valve is pivotally moved to a position for closing an opening of the air feed passage, so that the air from the blower is directed to the cleaning tube by way of the air feed tube and the branch passage. However, because the dust collection apparatus disclosed in the Japanese Utility Model Application publication No. Hei 3-92454 is designed to suck ambient air by flowing air, in comparison with the blower vacuum apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,714, in which suction can be exclusively performed, suction power will be inferior assuming that the dust collection apparatuses have power sources with identical output. Further, since the pivotable change-over valve is directly exposed in the passage, dust and rubbish may become entangled in the valve and render the change-over valve inoperable. Another conventional blower vacuum apparatus is shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. The apparatus includes a main body 310, a blower nozzle 330, and a vacuum nozzle 340. The main body 310 includes a fan case 313 accommodating a fan 319, a motor case 314 accommodating a motor 320, and a dust case 315 positioned below the motor case 314. A handle 312 is provided above the fan case 313. The fan case 313 has an upper wall in confrontation with the fan 319, and the upper wall is formed with grid like air inlet ports 313a. The dust case 315 is connected to a dust bag 350. The motor 320 has an output shaft 321 whose one end is connected to the fan 319. Another end of the output shaft 321 is connected to a cutter blade 318 positioned within the dust case 315. The blower nozzle 330 extends in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the fan 319, and has one end attached to the main body 310 and another end formed with an air blowing port 330a. The vacuum nozzle 340 extends in parallel with and integrally with the blower nozzle 330 and has one end attached to the main body 310 and another end formed with a suction port 340a. A change-over valve 373 is rotatably supported within the blower port 330a of the blower nozzle 330. The change-over valve 373 can be changed over between a vacuum mode position in which the valve shuts off the blower port 330a as shown in FIG. 15 and a blower mode position in which the valve opens the blower port 330a as shown in FIG. 16. In the blower mode, if the change-over valve 373 is rotated to its blower mode position and the fan 319 is rotated, air is introduced into the fan case 313 through the grid like air inlet ports 313a formed at the upper wall of the fan case 313. The introduced air passes through the blower nozzle 330 and is blown outside out of the air blowing port 330a. In the vacuum mode, the change-over valve 373 is changed over to the vacuum mode position. However, similar to the blower mode, the rotation of the fan 319 introduces air into the fan case 313 through the air inlet ports 313a, and the introduced air passes through the blower nozzle 330 and is directed toward the air blowing port 330a. The air impinges on the change-over valve 373 and is turned reversely as indicated by an arrow A in FIG. 15. Thus, the air is fed into the vacuum nozzle 340. Because of the air stream, ambient air around the suction port 340a of the vacuum nozzle 340 is sucked because of the creation of negative pressure into the vacuum nozzle 340 as indicated by arrows B. Accordingly, dust can be sucked from the suction port 330a and the sucked dust is directed toward the cutter blade 318 as indicated by arrows C and is pulverized thereat, and is then collected in the dust collection bag 350. However, in the conventional blower-vacuum apparatus shown in FIG. 15, powerful suction force cannot be provided, because suction of ambient air is achieved by the air stream similar to the dust collection apparatus described in the Japanese laid open Utility Model application publication No. Hei 3-92454. Further, dust may become entangled with the change-over valve rotatably supported at the air blowing port 330a so that change in operation mode may become difficult or impossible to perform. It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a blower-vacuum apparatus capable of providing a strong suction force with a direct suction of air from a vacuum nozzle by rotation of a fan without utilization of suction of ambient air around the air stream, and capable of performing a smooth mode changing operation without adhesion or entanglement of dust in a change-over mechanism. These and other objects of the present invention will be attained by providing a blower-vacuum apparatus including a main body, a blower nozzle having one end connected to the main body and another end formed with a blower port, a vacuum nozzle extending in parallel with and provided integrally with the blower nozzle, the vacuum nozzle having one end connected to the main body and another end formed with a suction port, a fan rotatably supported in the main body, a dust bag connected to the main body for receiving dust laden air which has been passing through an entire length of the vacuum nozzle from the suction port and for collecting the dust, and the improvement comprising a change-over mechanism 60 provided in the main body 10, 13, 14, 15 for selectively providing one of a vacuum mode position in which the air sucked from the suction port 40a is directed to the dust bag 50 and a blower mode position in which the sucked air is directed to the blower nozzle 30, the air being directly sucked exclusively from the suction port 40a during the vacuum mode by the rotation of the fan 19. With this arrangement, ambient air is not sucked by the air stream, but air is directly sucked exclusively from the suction port of the vacuum nozzle upon rotation of the fan, and therefore sufficient suction force is provided. Further, fixedly held vacuum and blower nozzles are used during both the vacuum mode and blower mode. Accordingly, exchange in components is not required at every switching between the vacuum mode and the blower mode. Furthermore, since the vacuum mode operation is not performed concurrently with the blower mode operation but these operations are carried out independently of each other, the probability of mixing of dust with the blowing air can be reduced. The change-over mechanism 60 preferably includes a change-over lever 61 positioned outside of the main body 15 and pivotally movably supported to the main body 15 at its supporting portion, a shield member 71, 71A rotatably disposed in the main body 15 and connected to the change-over lever 61 for passing or blocking the sucked air, the shield member 71, 71A having a wall portion 72 in confrontation with the supporting portion of the main body 15, and preferably, a guard member 81, 81B is positioned in the main body 15 and fixed thereto for preventing the dust from entering a space between the wall portion 72 and the supporting portion where the change-over lever 61 is supported. The wall portion 72 is covered by the guard member 81, 81B. Furthermore, the blower port 30a preferably has a cross-sectional area smaller than that of the suction port 40a. With this structure, because the guard member is provided, change-over operation of the change-over mechanism is never obstructed by the entry of the dust into the change-over mechanism. Thus, change-over operations between the blower mode and the vacuum mode can be smoothly performed. Because the cross-sectional area of the blower port is smaller than that of the suction port, air velocity blowing out of the blower nozzle during the blower mode is higher than air velocity sucked into the vacuum nozzle. Accordingly, leaves and large trash are blown away, and not sucked in through the suction port. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a blower-vacuum apparatus including a housing 113 having an air introduction port 113b for air blowing and a dust port 118 for air suction, an impeller 119 having an air inlet side 119b and an air blower side 119a, the air inlet side 119b being selectively communicable with the air introduction port 113b and the air blower side 119a being selectively communicable with the dust port 118, a motor 120 for driving the impeller 119, a vacuum nozzle 140 connected to the housing 113 adjacent the inlet side 119b of the impeller 119, a blower nozzle 130 connected to the housing 113 adjacent the blower side 119a of the impeller 119, a first shield member 173 for selectively opening and closing the air introduction port 113b, the air inlet side 119b being in fluid communication with the vacuum nozzle 140 when the first shield member 173 closes the air introduction port 113b, and the air inlet side 119b being shut off from the vacuum nozzle 140 when the first shield member 173 opens the air introduction port 113b, and a second shield member 174 for selectively opening and closing the dust port 118, the air blower side 119a being in fluid communication with the blower nozzle 130 when the second shield member 174 closes the dust port 118, and the air blower side 119a being shut off from the blower nozzle 130 when the second shield member 174 opens the dust port 118. In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided a blower vacuum apparatus including the above described housing, the impeller, the motor, the vacuum nozzle, the blower nozzle, a first shield member switchable between a first position where the first shield member closes the air introduction port and provides fluid communication between the vacuum nozzle and the air inlet side and a second position where the first shield member opens the air introduction port and shuts off a fluid communication between the vacuum nozzle and the air inlet side, and a second shield member switchable between a first switch position where the second shield member opens the dust port and shuts off a fluid communication between the blower nozzle and the blower side and a second switch position where the second shield member closes the dust port and provides a fluid communication between the blower nozzle and the blower side, and change-over interlocking means 260 for interlockingly switching the second shield member to its first switch position upon switching of the first shield member to its first position for providing a vacuum mode, and for interlockingly switching the second shield member to its second switch position upon switching of the first shield member to its second position for providing a blower mode."
7317972,Management of peak water use,2001-10-31,1,1,"The field of the invention is water management. Municipalities, water districts, and other agencies that supply water to consumers sometimes regulate the distribution of water because they have an insufficient supply of water to meet consumer demand, maintain water reserves for fire control, etc. Although, insufficient water supplies may occur anytime during the year, they generally occur during the summer and especially during periods of extended drought that frequently result in low water reserves and higher than normal water demands for irrigation. The primary method used to regulate water distribution is through the use of restrictions on the use of water for irrigation or restricting other outdoor water use, such as, hosing the driveways and washing cars. Restrictions on irrigation include requiring consumers to irrigate only on odd days or even days, irrigate only two times a week instead of daily, and so forth. Various means are used to obtain the irrigation users compliance with the restrictions and may include fines, conservation pricing, education, etc. As mentioned above, these restrictions are usually imposed when there are extended periods of drought. However, restrictions have been imposed on irrigation applications when there is high usage of water on specific days and even intra-day high water use. For example, irrigations are sometimes restricted to being applied during certain times of the day, such as from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. This eliminates the operation of irrigation systems during the day time hours when there is likely higher indoor water use. Setting the irrigation controller to only execute an irrigation application during the evening or early morning hours should reduce the high peak water use values that would have occurred had the irrigations been executed during the daytime hours. High peak water use values may occur on days following days with extremely hot and dry weather conditions. This occurs because higher irrigation watering amounts generally are applied on days following days with extremely hot and dry weather conditions. This is especially true with controllers that vary irrigation applications based on evapotranspiration (ET controllers). Evapotranspiration rates are closely correlated to the water requirements of plants. Evapotranspiration is the water lost by direct evaporation from the soil and plant and by transpiration from the plant surface. Potential evapotranspiration (ETo) is calculated from meteorological data and the hotter, dryer the weather conditions the higher will be the ETo readings. As ETo rates increase, due to hot, dry weather, the irrigation application watering amounts, applied by ET controllers, will also increase. If there are several ET controllers installed in a water supply area, a high peak water use value could occur on a day following a day with hot, dry weather conditions. There are several companies that are presently marketing ET controllers or will be in the near future. Irrigation controllers that derive all or part of the irrigation schedule from potential evapotranspiration (ETo) data are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,339 issued December 1995, to Miller, U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,861 issued March 1992 to Hopkins, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,787 issued June 1991 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,937 issued July 1993 both to Evelyn-Veere, U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,855, issued May 1993, to Marian, U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,671, issued December 1997, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,302, issued February 1999, both to Oliver and U.S. Pat. No. 6,102,061, issued August, 2000 to Addink. Most of the above ET controllers base application durations on the previous days ETo rates. However, U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,855 discusses an ET controller that schedules irrigation application durations based on an average of the previous weeks ETo data. This generally prevents high water applications being applied on any one day but may also result in irrigations that do not meet the water requirements of the plants. This is especially true, when a cool, wet week is followed by an extremely hot, dry week. What is needed is an irrigation management system that uses a microprocessor to automatically derive a new irrigation schedule and/or automatically control the water use of other water using devices to reduce the potential of extremely high peak water use values from occurring. Further more, the new irrigation schedules have to meet the water needs of the plants with very little waste of water. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides systems and methods in which an irrigation management system reduces high peak water use values by utilizing a microprocessor disposed in an irrigation controller. The microprocessor is programmed to (a) receive peak water use information from a water supplier, (b) receive water use information at a consumer site, and (c) automatically derive a new irrigation schedule that is at least partly based on the peak water use information and the water use information. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the information relating to peak water use may include information on a maximum threshold water requirement value, a set volume of water available for the consumer's use during a specified time period and other information that could be used by the microprocessor to automatically reduce high peak water use values. A water supplier that transmits information related to peak water use to the microprocessor may be a municipality, water district or any other entity that supplies water to consumers. Information on water use at a consumer site may include information on prioritized landscape watering zones, maximum water to be applied during any one irrigation application and any other information on water use at the consumer site that potentially could be used by the microprocessor to automatically reduce high peak water use values. A consumer may be a residential water user, an agricultural water user, a commercial water user or any other entity that uses water. A microprocessor may receive peak water use information and water use information via a wired or wireless connection. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a new irrigation schedule, derived by the microprocessor, may include a modification in a default irrigation frequency, a modification in a default irrigation start time(s), a reduction in a default irrigation application duration, use of a rolling-average in the determination of the new irrigation application duration, and other changes or modifications to the default irrigation schedule that will provide for a reduction in high peak water use values. It is further contemplated that a microprocessor will display to a water user and/or third party details on a new irrigation schedule as well as information received from a water supplier. Various objects, features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description that describes a preferred embodiment of the invention, along with the accompanying drawings in which like numerals represent like components."

6884756,Water-dispersible pellets,2002-09-16,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to water-dispersible particles for delivery of biomolecules. More particularly, the present invention relates to water-dispersible methylene urea particles for delivery of biomolecules. 2. Description of the Related Art A continuing problem in care of large areas of cultivated vegetation is the difficulty of delivery of an agent such as a plant nutrient, fertilizer or a pesticide to the target. A practical and labor-saving approach to agent delivery in areas such as golf courses, parks, lawns, gardens and woodlands has been broadcast application of granular products containing an agent, for example via rotary spreader. Using granular products having particle sizes in the range of about 1 millimeter to about 10 millimeters, an operator can cover a large area with minimal distance traversed by the spreader itself, while applying the granular products relatively uniformly to the desired area. Unfortunately, such granular products often remain in solid or semisolid form several days following their application. This is a problem when the granular product is carrying an active ingredient such as pesticides, plant growth regulators, micronutrients, or plant growth hormones because these substances remain physically bound up with the granule so that their efficacy is reduced or delayed. This can result in loss of the active ingredient via volatilization and photodegradation with the consequence of lower efficacy and higher cost. A further consequence of the fact that granular products often remain in solid or semisolid form for long periods following application is that the granules are subject to removal by cultural practices such as mowing with clipping removal, leaf and or yard waste vacuuming; or run-off from weather events, especially on sloping ground where the underlying soils have low percolation rates; where the ground cover is closely mown or relatively thin and sparse; and where the equipment or pedestrians traffic is high. This causes a loss of the uniformity of the biological response sought by the use of the product. In addition, product efficacy may be altered due to excessive concentration of the product within the areas treated. The long persistence of the granular products also results in a greater likelihood that people and or animals may come into physical contact with the granules, which may result in skin irritation, sensitization, dermal absorption and toxicity. Additionally, when clothing, footwear and equipment come into physical contact with the granules, they can cause damage, corrosion or staining. The present invention solves the problems associated with persistence of granular products by providing compositions and methods for making controlled release nitrogen pellets which are water-dispersible. The inventive pellets, when handled without coming into contact with water, have physical characteristics similar to existing controlled release nitrogen granules, allowing broadcast application. Following application, the inventive pellets disperse on contact with moisture from the treated area itself, from irrigation or from natural precipitation. The dispersion of the pellets allows the controlled release nitrogen and other active ingredients, to be deposited downwards and laterally from the original position of the pellet, so that the controlled release nitrogen and other active ingredients are less likely to be removed from the treated area, ingested by small children or animals, or otherwise contacted by people, animals, clothing, footwear or equipment. Water-dispersibility also prevents wastage of any relatively expensive components of the inventive pellets since more of the ingredients reach their respective targets. Thus, there is a continuing need for a uniformly sized, durable product in particle form which can deliver nitrogen in a controlled release manner and whose components are quickly dispersible in order to provide even delivery of active agents to target plants and organisms over a large area. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Water dispersible particles are provided that disperse into more than 100 pieces upon contact with water. Particles include from 5%-99.9% of a nitrogen containing ingredient bioavailable to a targeted desirable organism and 1%-95% of a binder component. Additionally provided is a process for making a water dispersible particle, the process including the steps of mechanically aggregating particle components into a pellet. Particle components include a bioavailable nitrogen containing ingredient and a binder, the components being such that a product particle is dispersed into more than 100 pieces upon contact with water. In a further step of a process for making a water dispersible particle, the pellet is dried to form a particle. A process of nutrient delivery is provided that includes the steps of administering a particle that disperses into more than 100 pieces following water contact. A water dispersible particle includes from 5%-99.9% of a nitrogen containing ingredient bioavailable to a targeted desirable organism and 1%-95% of a binder component. Following administration of a described particle, water is allowed to contact the particle, dispersing it into pieces and thereby delivering a nutrient."
6857225,Method of treating sandy soils with multi-branched regenerating wetting agents,2003-06-13,1,1,"This invention relates to certain novel formulations of turf additives that act in such a manner as to permit proper amounts of moisture to contact root systems in order to reduce dry spots within highly managed turf areas and/or lawns. The inventive formulation comprising multi-branched surfactant compounds with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic constituents within each branch attached to an oxygen-containing polyfunctional base compound permits effective moisture penetration through such localized dry spots for sustained grass growth therein. Importantly, such multi-branched wetting agents provide sustained moisture penetration over a sustained period of time since the individual branches of such compounds may become dissociated from its base polyfunctional compound. Since such branches include both hydrophobic and hydrophilic constituents themselves, and thus act as wetting agents, even after degradation of the initial surfactant compound, long-term wetting and moisture penetration, at least, are permitted. Methods of treating sandy soils with such compounds and formulations thereof are also contemplated within this invention. BACKGROUND OF THE PRIOR ART Water repellent soil, whether in sandy areas or not, have proven to be the most difficult conditions in which plant life may be grown. Such a condition basically prevents or drastically reduces the ability of water to infiltrate from the ground level to subterranean root systems. In addition, environmental problems may occur as well due to surface runoff from rain, thereby transporting pesticides and/or fertilizers from the desired agriculture locations to ponds, lakes, reservoirs, or other undesirable water sources, as well as increasing the chances of ground water contamination therefrom. Water content and soil particle size contribute to such water repellency issues, in addition to the presence of certain organic matter therein (humic acid, for example, as discussed in greater detail below). Such organic matter basically causes water repellency in the specific soils by imparting hydrophobic properties thereto while adhering to the soil particles themselves via hydrophilic constituents present within the particular organic matter. In particular, localized dry spots are a distinct problem within highly managed turf areas and/or lawns, in particular those with sandy soils, primarily for aesthetic reasons. Such dry spots are the result of the development of areas of varying degrees of water repellency within and at the surface of the target soil. Plant water usage is critical to sustained plant growth; however, the existence of such localized dry spots creates a problem with nonuniformity of water supply to treated grasses over time. Basically, in times of high stress and/or easy water evaporation (e.g., higher temperatures, low humidity), such water repellency areas will exhibit higher water loss than others. As a result, the plant life present within the target lawn or green will not receive uniform, and, at times, vastly different levels of, water supply. As time passes, the difference in the amount of water supplied to discrete areas of the target lawn or green may become more disparate. Thus, the possibility for localized dry spots to materialize within sandy soils is relatively high over a sustained length of time (e.g., from 6 to 18 months on average from genesis to being empirically noticed), and, again, most times the existence of such dry spots is unknown to the lawn or green caretaker until materialization (since the presence of such water repellency areas may exist anywhere within the topsoil, from the surface to as low as about 2 inches below, the area of greatest concentration of grass root systems). Also, hydrophobicity of sand creates certain problems with regard to pooling water after raining (as one example) which in turn causes unsightly areas either within highly sandy yards, ballparks, or beaches, or to provide water penetration in dry sandy conditions in order to possibly sustain plant-life therein (such as arid desert-like areas). Reduction in such water repellency would thus be helpful in maintaining, at least, better aesthetics for such sandy areas, as well as the possibility for permitting or promoting the growth of sustained plant life in such dry, barren areas. Without intending to be bound to any particular scientific theory, it is believed that such water repellency areas within sandy soils are the result of the presence of humic substances and their attachment to soil components, particularly in large accumulations at the topsoil surface. Humus is degraded plant and animal matter (by microbial organisms) and is basically the organic portion of soil that comprises the necessary nutrients to sustain plant growth and life therein. One byproduct of such humus (again produced through a naturally occurring process within the soil) is humic acid (simply the acidic form of humus, basically a mix of various different materials). Humic acid and other like substances, although necessary for the sustenance of plant life as it provides the aforementioned nutrients to root systems, unfortunately also appears to create problems within sandy soils, most particularly the creation of a waxy organic, water-repellent coating upon binding to and with soil components (for instance, and without limitation, sand). If such a coating is permitted to accumulate over a long period of time, such as the aforementioned 6 to 18 month period, and particularly at the topsoil surface, the coating becomes highly water repellent in nature and uniform plant water use is difficult to achieve. In theory, and, again, without intending to be bound to such theory, it is believed that such a coating is formed by the amphiphylic humic acid (or other like humic substance) adhering, by its hydrophilic portion, to the hydrophilic sites within the sandy soil, permitting the highly hydrophobic ends to extend (similar in nature to a micelle). Such a coating is thus hydrophobic in nature and, when present as a thorough coating over such surface portions, again, tends to either drive water away or facilitate water loss by preventing moisture from passing through to the subterranean roots of any plants therein. If the water remains at the surface, evaporation is also facilitated as such moisture cannot easily penetrate the hydrohphobic soil surface. Such a problem exists, as noted above, not only within greens, but also within lawns and pastures (as merely some examples of such trouble areas). In order to provide a uniform appearance in lawns and greens, it has been a requirement either to water consistently in very large amounts (which is wasteful and possibly damaging to the plants themselves) or to water selected trouble areas by hand on a continuous basis (which is labor-intensive and possibly wasteful in terms of water consumption). Furthermore, it is generally too late to know of problematic water repellent areas within such lawns or greens until they become apparent empirically. For pastures, pools of water develop sporadically on occasion due to this problem; the standard method of remedying this problem is to dig up the earth and wait for the humic substances to be consumed as nutrients (over a relatively long period of time) by the root systems therein. Such a procedure thus leaves an aesthetically displeasing result and is not always reliable for reducing water repellency therein. Thus, it has been found that there exists a need to provide a simple method for providing effective moisture penetration through such highly hydrophobic coatings to ameliorate the lack of hydrophilicity, and thus water availability at the soil surface and within the subterranean root systems thereof without causing detrimental effects to the surface plant life. In the past, the best methods of reducing the amount and presence of localized dry spots have basically involved the introduction of certain standard surfactants to the soil for the transport of water through the surface coating, preferably in tandem with compounds that decrease the surface tension of the waxy coating to permit penetration of the active surfactant components themselves in U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,023 to Ogawa et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,957 to Bowey et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,268 to Taguchi et al. Such a method has been problematic to a certain extent due to the cost associated with some silicon-based surfactants, biodegradability issues of most viable surfactants, as well as foaming problems when water is present, and/or the difficulty in removal of degraded coating components after surfactant treatment. Also, this specific surfactant-only treatment does not remove the waxy coating to an appreciable degree from the target topsoil surface. Furthermore, prior surfactant treatments are limited in effectiveness due to the need for continued application thereof to target soils over a relatively short period of time for any sustained improvements in moisture penetration. A long-term (e.g., greater than 4 months, or a season) formulation applied in a single application or in split applications spaced 7 to 10 days apart and/or method for providing water repellency improvements are thus unavailable to the pertinent industry at this time. Another manner of reducing such dry spot problems has been increasing watering itself. However, as noted above, such a method is labor intensive and, in many areas where water is not plentiful, use for aesthetic purposes (e.g., lawns, greens, and the like), is preferably kept at a minimum as compared to other more important purposes (e.g., drinking water). Such an issue also contributes to the aforementioned development of water repellency areas over long periods of time because of the inability of the caretaker to continuously supply moisture to target lawns, greens, etc., to the levels needed to best ensure uniformity of watering is accomplished. Other possible attempts at alleviating such a problem exist, albeit as an aim at removing contaminants (e.g., oils, fuels, etc.) from the target soils for improving plant growth therein (U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,896 to Jahnke et al. and WO01/26832 to Lubrizol Corporation). None of these procedures provide the necessary degree of wetting at the lower cost and/or labor intensity to overcome the hydrophobicity problems noted above. Wetter formulations applied in a single application or in split applications spaced 7 to 10 days apart to provide wetting methods for season-long consistent and continuous moisture penetration within such hydrophobic soils are nonexistent currently. Such a currently unavailable method and formulation providing such beneficial results are thus highly desirable to the soil treatment industry."
7444207,Modular and expandable irrigation controller,2004-12-23,1,1,"This invention relates to an irrigation controller for controlling the operation of an irrigation system. In particular, this invention relates to a modular irrigation controller with expandable features. Modular irrigation controllers use optional modules that can be added to the controller to increase the number of irrigation stations that may be controlled by the controller. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,248 (William et al.) provides an irrigation controller having a housing that encloses a microprocessor that stores and executes watering programs, and includes station modules that can be added within the housing to increase the number of irrigation stations controlled. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,936 (Faris et al.) provides a controller having a base unit for actuating a predetermined minimum number of irrigation stations. External station expansion modules can be added to the base unit for increasing the number of irrigation stations controlled by the controller. Also describes are optional pump modules and accessory timer modules that behave the same as the station modules in that they provide an electrical output signal to a pump or to an accessory (such as a light), instead of to an irrigation station. However, the expansion modules in these patents simply act as additional station outputs (e.g., a conduit extension of the logic inside the controller and only include driver circuitry responsive to commands from the base unit) and do not provide any additional functionality or intelligence. In order to add functionality to these controllers apart from adding additional station outputs (e.g., to control additional stations or accessories), a user would have to purchase another irrigation controller configured with the desired functionality. There exists, therefore, a need for an improved irrigation controller with a flexible and expandable architecture modular design, along with an enhanced communications to the modules that will provide enough flexibility for further additions to an irrigation system, not only to include additional output stations, but also to upgrade to new features and capabilities of expansion and re-configuration. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the present invention answer the above and other needs by providing an irrigation controller with flexible and expandable capabilities for controlling the operation of an irrigation system. In accordance with this several embodiments, the irrigation controller includes a base unit with a removable and programmable control panel and a bus for communicating with a plurality of removable modules capable of performing a variety of functions and expanding the capacity of the irrigation controller beyond the physical limitations of its housing. Also provided are various expansion modules having additionally functionality and related methods and features for use in the modular irrigation controllers described herein as well as in other irrigation control systems.

7640079,Modular and expandable irrigation controller,2004-12-23,1,1,"This invention relates to an irrigation controller for controlling the operation of an irrigation system. In particular, this invention relates to a modular irrigation controller with expandable features. Modular irrigation controllers use optional modules that can be added to the controller to increase the number of irrigation stations that may be controlled by the controller. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,956,248 (William et al.) provides an irrigation controller having a housing that encloses a microprocessor that stores and executes watering programs, and includes station modules that can be added within the housing to increase the number of irrigation stations controlled. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,936 (Faris et al.) provides a controller having a base unit for actuating a predetermined minimum number of irrigation stations. External station expansion modules can be added to the base unit for increasing the number of irrigation stations controlled by the controller. Also describes are optional pump modules and accessory timer modules that behave the same as the station modules in that they provide an electrical output signal to a pump or to an accessory (such as a light), instead of to an irrigation station. However, the expansion modules in these patents simply act as additional station outputs (e.g., a conduit extension of the logic inside the controller and only include driver circuitry responsive to commands from the base unit) and do not provide any additional functionality or intelligence. In order to add functionality to these controllers apart from adding additional station outputs (e.g., to control additional stations or accessories), a user would have to purchase another irrigation controller configured with the desired functionality. There exists, therefore, a need for an improved irrigation controller with a flexible and expandable architecture modular design, along with an enhanced communications to the modules that will provide enough flexibility for further additions to an irrigation system, not only to include additional output stations, but also to upgrade to new features and capabilities of expansion and re-configuration.

7422682,"Compositions, devices, and methods for use in environmental remediation",2005-06-28,2,1,"FIELD OF THE ART The field of art disclosed herein pertains to compositions, devices, and methods suited for a variety of applications in environmental remediation. BACKGROUND The uses of structural barriers for a variety of applications in environmental remediation are generally well described. Several types of environmental remediation barriers (ERBs) are used in earth and hydraulic engineering, such exemplary structures including fiber rolls, mats, blankets, and berms. Originally, major applications of ERBs included erosion and sedimentation control, revegetation, and revetment. More recently, the potential for such structures to serve additionally in the capacity of removal of natural and manmade pollutants from residential, industrial, and agricultural sources, and remediation of eutrification has been described. As the name of one type of ERB, fiber roll, suggests, ERBs packed into a covering, such as a netted material, may be filled with fibers; typically a single natural fiber such as abaca, hemp, jute, flax, sisal, coir, or straw materials. For a major application of fiber-filled ERBs in erosion and sediment control, the purpose of the fiber filling is primarily structural. In that regard, though the natural fibers described are capable of absorbing water, one necessary attribute of the fiber filler has been to provide an effective porosity once packed that allows for the ready passage of water, while promoting the retention of mud, sediment, gravel, and the like. Other desirable attributes of natural fibers used in ERBs include ready availability in high volume and low cost, requirement to be germ, insect and weed free, free of chemical pollutants, ability to degrade after use; thereby obviating creation of harmful waste, and ease of processing into targeted devices. Materials in addition to natural fibers have been suggested as supplemental constituents in ERBs. Particularly, vegetative matter, as well as nutrients and fertilizers for revegetation and revetment have been described. Materials that have been suggested include saw dust, wood chips, bark, compost, flocculants, water absorbents, and pesticides. A major objective in the field has been to establish environmental remediation practices that are consistent with good practices for environmental protection in general. In that regard, the reuse of natural materials, such as saw dust, wood chips, bark, and compost, that would otherwise go to waste has been a motive for creating fillings for ERBs. Especially in consideration of the use of ERBs in functions where the filling has a requirement that is more than structural; moreover where the filling must perform additional multiple functions, such as clarification of runoff water and removal of pollutants, the targeted and judicious selection of materials tailored for such multifunctional use throughout the lifetime of the ERBs still remains a challenge. Accordingly, a need exists for more effective compositions of materials that are multifunctional for a variety of environmental remediation needs, and for a range of ERBs utilizing such compositions and their use."
7617617,Process and apparatus for manufacture of fertilizer products from manure and sewage,2006-04-07,2,1,"This invention relates to processes and equipment for economically converting manure and sewage into fertilizer (particularly certified organic fertilizer) and soil builder products with high organic matter content (also certified organic) for agronomic uses. The number and size of concentrated animal feeding and other agricultural operations, which produce beef, pork, poultry, elk and other game animals, goat, lamb, fish, milk, cheese, eggs and other foodstuffs produced from animals, have been steadily increasing for the past 50 years. The same is true for other animal feeding operations for sheep, mink, alpaca and other animals for production of wool, furs and other fiber products. The primary benefit of housing and feeding larger numbers of agricultural animals at a single site is that the consolidated operations give an economy of scale that lowers per unit product operating costs and improves profitability. However, as the number and size of concentrated, confined animal feeding operations has grown over the years, the development of technology to treat the waste material from these facilities has seriously lagged. The majority of the waste material is transported to sites distant from these facilities and is applied with little or no treatment to land where food crops are grown. Consequently, there are environmental and health concerns about direct application of raw or minimally treated manure to the ground, including rainwater runoff of pollutants into surface and ground waters and emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere due to bioconversion or decomposition. Disposal of manure is a significant cost to the animal feeding operation, because manure is produced in high volumes with high moisture content. Chicken egg production in the United States has undergone significant change in recent years. Such change is characterized by growth of the producing flock, and individual producing sites have become larger. For example, it is estimated that there are currently more than 50 egg production facilities in the United States which contain a minimum of one million laying hens. Producers have been faced with the fact that egg production and processing operations must become large and more concentrated to improve economic performance in a competitive business environment. However, these major producing facilities with more than one million layers, typically do not use any type of manure processing technology, but simply apply the manure to farm ground as a method of disposal. As mentioned above, there are significant environmental concerns with this method of disposing of manure generated by the egg producing operation. Animal manures from dairy, feed lot and hog facilities typically have a moisture content in excess of 70% by weight, which makes it difficult to handle and dispose of such manures economically. Removing moisture for volume reduction to enable landfill disposal is too costly and is environmentally undesirable. Transport to farm sites for direct disposal and use on crop land is also costly and is environmentally undesirable due to noxious odors released on application and due to the presence of contaminants, such as antibiotics, hormones, pesticides, etc., in the manure. In some cases, the application of raw or concentrated raw manure could cause plant kill in some applications due to such contaminants. Bioconversion, commonly used for treatment of municipal sewage and livestock waste, refers to the conversion or decomposition of organic materials (such as organic waste) into useful products (such as usable feed or fuel) by bacterial decomposition of such organic matter. Bioconversion includes anaerobic and aerobic digestion. In some cases, operators of animal feeding operations have constructed lagoons and holding ponds to hold manure and to allow bioconversion digestion of the waste material before it is applied to the land. However, the condition and operation of some of these lagoons has been the subject of national news headlines, such as the breach of lagoon dikes in North Carolina, Iowa and elsewhere when flooding occurs. They also have the problems of requiring large land areas, and they have no control of emissions of noxious odors and greenhouse or polluting gases into the atmosphere. While research by universities and government laboratories has shown that animal manure may, under certain controlled conditions, be effectively treated by anaerobic digestion, poultry and swine manure have been shown to be among the most difficult to treat. Conventional anaerobic digestion technology has certain limitations in terms of slow reaction rates (low throughput), particularly in cold climates, and the ability of the bacteria to be productive when conditions (such as pH, temperature and concentration of certain chemical constituents) in the digester are not optimum. Current literature teaches that anaerobic treatment of poultry manure can only be accomplished if the manure is diluted with water at a weight ratio of between about 4 to 1 and about 10 to 1 water to solids. While such dilution allows for better bioconversion and digestion of the manure, it also increases the volume of waste that must be handled and ultimately processed for disposal. As a result, this approach increases processing costs and is not economically desirable. In spite of the efforts of governments and the animal feeding industry, there are no cost effective manure treatment facilities in operation that are not a significant and direct financial burden to the agricultural producer. In addition, the processes in use, such as biogas production from manure, themselves have environmental problems, such as producing a biodigested toxic sludge that must be disposed of in an acceptable manner. Therefore, new and improved methods of treating agricultural manure that overcome the technical defects and economic disadvantages of the prior art are highly desired. A similar situation exists for municipal sewage due to rapid growth of cities and inadequate building or upgrading of sewage treatment facilities to keep up with the population growth. Aerobic digestion is commonly used for bioconversion of municipal waste, which also produces large volumes of dilute, high water, low solids, content mixtures that are costly to dispose of. In many countries a municipal sludge is produced by raising the solids content, and the resulting municipal sludge is disposed of by application to cropland. This is less common in the U.S. and Canada, and in some cases, is prohibited, so the sludge has been disposed of in landfill locations. However, due to federal, state and local government restrictions on the volume of waste permitted in landfill operations and the increasing fees for landfill disposal, the emphasis of technology in recent years has been on volume reduction of municipal waste by drying, incineration, etc., to reduce the cost of disposal of remaining solids in landfills. Incineration and pyrolysis are increasingly disfavored due to air pollution and solids disposal problems. Again, new and improved methods of treating municipal waste and sludge to overcome the technical and economic disadvantages of the prior art are highly desired. Various rules and regulations have been developed for the purpose of sterilizing or decontaminating biological sludges, manures and wastes. In 1993 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated rules for the treatment and management of municipal sewage sludge (EPA, 1993). These rules set standards for pathogen destruction (disinfection), vector attraction reduction (VAR), and metal contaminant reduction in sewage sludge. The disinfection standards are separated into two categories: Class B in which sludges are treated to partially destroy pathogens; and Class A where pathogenic bacteria, enteric viruses and helminth parasites are reduced to near detection limits. Processes previously approved by EPA as Class A disinfection processes include: thermal treatment, based on a prescribed time-temperature relationship; advanced alkaline stabilization with accelerated drying, combining raising a pH above 12 for 72 hours, heating to greater than 125° F. for 12 hours, and producing solids greater than 50%; composting; heat drying; heat treatment of liquid sludge; thermophilic aerobic digestion; beta ray irradiation; gamma ray irradiation; pasteurization (temperature greater than 158° F. for at least 30 minutes); a combination of a pH reaching at least 12 and pasteurization; and several advanced digestion processes (EPA, 1999). Processes that purport to meet these EPA standards are costly in operation and typically do not provide satisfactory results. Examples of the prior art and publications that have addressed the above problems by digestion, incineration, volume reduction and/or decomposition are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,535,528 to Finham, 5,685,153 to Dickenson et al.; 6,039,774 to McMullen et al.; 6,125,633 and 6,173,508 to Strohmeyer; 6,171,499 to Bouchalat; 6,524,632 to Kartchner; 6,613,562 to Dvork; 6,682,578 to Sower; and U.S. Patent Application 2004/0025715 by Bonde et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Another problem existing in animal feeding operations and sewage treatment is air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and CO 2 , and gases having noxious odors. As residential housing areas have expanded, many have encroached on land adjacent to animal feeding operations, then complaints from residents regarding the noxious odors escalate. In addition to the odors and air polluting greenhouse gases produced from the manure and bioconversion of manure, significant quantities of the noxious and greenhouse gases are produced directly from the animals in their flatulence, burps and regurgitation. In addition to the need to control noxious and greenhouse gases emitted directly from the manure (urine and feces) or from decomposition of the manure, there is a recognized need to control the noxious and greenhouse gas emissions from the animals themselves and prevent same from being released into the atmosphere. There is also increasing emphasis in developed countries on the production of food crops by use of certified organic crop production processes and materials. The governments of Canada, Australia, the United States, the European Union and other countries have developed standards for qualifying food products as “organic” or “organically produced,” and several certifying organizations and government agencies exist to certify farms and market produce as “organic” under the appropriate standards. The concept underpinning “organic” food and crop production is that the inputs used in crop or animal production (fertilizer, seeds, feeds, sprays, etc.) are allowed to contain only minimal levels of certain approved non-natural materials, such as synthetic chemical fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, etc., and are allowed to contain essentially no amounts of designated undesirable materials, such as pesticides, drugs, growth hormones, pathogens, etc. The following are examples of the standards setting agencies: CGSB—Canadian General Standards Board Standards Council of Canada 270 Albert Street, Suite 200 Ottawa, Ontario K1P 6N7, Canada NOSB/NOP—National Organic Standards Board/National Organics Program U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20250 USA CAAQ—Conseil des appellations agroalimentaires du Québec 35, rue de Port-Royal Est, 2ème étage Montréal, QC, H3L 3T1 Canada The Council of European Communities Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat, 175 B-1048 Brussels, Belgium IFOAM Charles-de-Gaulle-Str. 5 53113 Bonn—Germany C6DEX Alimentarius Commission FAO—Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Viale delle Terme di Caracalla 0100 Rome, Italy FSANZ—Food Standards Australia New Zealand Boeing House 55 Blackall Street BARON ACT 2600 PO Box 7186 Canberra BC ACT 2610 Australia JAS—Japan Agricultural Standards Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tokyo Center for Quality Control and Consumers Service Omiya City, Japan COABC—The Certified Organic Association of British Columbia #8-A 100 Kalamalka Lake Road Vernon BC, V1T 9G1 Canada OMRI—The Organic Materials Review Institute PO box 11558 Eugene, Oreg. 97440-3758, USA The following are examples of the organizations that have been qualified and accepted by at least one standards setting agency for certifying that specific producers/produce are in compliance with the applicable organic standards: FVOPA—Fraser Valley Organic Producers Association Surrey (CB), Canada GBE—Garantie Bio—Ecocert Levis (Quebec), Canada FOG—Florida Certified Organic Growers & Consumers, Inc.

Bristol, United Kingdom These standard setting organizations and agencies have been developed due to the rapidly increasing consumer demand, not only for organic products, but for some reliable standards so consumers can have confidence in the organic product labeling. Thus, the “certified organic” labeling and terminology have been developed to mean products or produce certified by recognized organizations as meeting the applicable agency standards and product or produce made by methods that meet the agency standards for organic production methods. One essential aspect of certified organic food production is the necessity of using inputs that are certified organic, such as fertilizers, which are either approved, such as materials containing no pathogens or other disqualifying components, or regulated and accepted, such as manures, composts and the like that meet the applicable standards. Technology developed to date for producing certified organic fertilizer products has not been satisfactory due to one or more problems in product quality, environmental acceptability or economic feasibility for providing a reasonably priced commercial product. Examples of the prior art and publications that have addressed the production of organic or certified organic fertilizer products are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,354,349 to Inoue; 6,461,399 to Connell; 6,517,600 and 6,645,267 to Dinel; U.S. Patent Applications 2003/0038078 by Stamper et al., 2003/0089151 and 2003/0136165 by Logan et al., and 2003/0111410 by Branson, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It is apparent from the above that there is a substantial unmet need for environmentally and economically acceptable technologies for disposal of manure and sewage, for control of noxious and greenhouse gases from animal feeding operations, and for production of organic fertilizer and soil builder products that can be certified for food production inputs under established standards for certified organic food production. The present invention is directed to methods, apparatus, systems and products for meeting one or all of these needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides economical and simplified methods, systems and apparatus for converting manure feedstocks to fertilizer and soil builder products, preferably conversion to certified organic fertilizer and soil builder products.

7921601,Water amusement system with trees,2006-04-20,1,1,"BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present disclosure generally relates to water amusement attractions and rides. More particularly, the disclosure generally relates to a system and method for a water transportation system. Further, the disclosure generally relates to water-powered rides and to a system and method in which participants may be actively involved in a water attraction. Certain embodiments include one or more composite trees that may support one or more elevated structures. 2. Description of Related Art The 1980's witnessed a phenomenal growth in participatory family water recreation facilities (e.g., water parks) and in water oriented ride attractions in traditional themed amusement parks. In the current main genre of water ride attractions (e.g., waterslides, river rapid rides, log flumes), participants walk or are mechanically lifted to a high point, where gravity enables water, rider(s), and riding vehicle (if appropriate) to slide down a chute or incline to a lower elevation splash pool, whereafter the cycle repeats. Some rides can move riders uphill and downhill but for efficiency and performance reasons these rides also generally start on an elevated tower and generally require walking up steps to reach the start of the ride. Generally, traditional downhill water rides are of short duration (normally measured in seconds of ride time) and have limited throughput capacity. The combination of these two factors quickly leads to a situation in which patrons of the parks typically have long queue line waits of up to two or three hours for a ride that, although exciting, lasts only a few seconds. Additional problems like hot and sunny weather, wet patrons, and other difficulties may create a poor overall customer feeling of satisfaction or perceived entertainment value in the water park experience. Additionally, typical downhill water park rides are not designed to transport guests between rides. In large amusement parks, transportation between rides or areas of the park may be provided by a train or monorail system, or guests may walk from ride to ride or area to area. These forms of transportation have relatively minor entertainment value and are passive in nature, in that they have little if any active guest-controlled functions such as choice of pathway, speed of riders, or rider activity besides sightseeing from the vehicle. These forms of transportation are generally unsuitable for water parks because of high installation and operating costs and poor ambience within the parks. These types of transportation are often unsuitable for water park guests who, because of the large amount of time spent in the water, are often wet and want to be more active because of the combination of high ambient temperatures in summertime parks and the normal heat loss due to water immersion and evaporative cooling. Water helps cool guests and encourages a higher level of physical activity. Guests also want to stay in the water for fun. Water parks are designed around the original experience of a swimming hole combined with new sports, such as river rafting or tubing. A desirable feeling for some guests is one of natural ambience and organic experience. A good river ride combines calm areas and excitement areas like rapids, whirlpools, and beaches. Mechanical transportation systems do not fit in well with these types of rides. There exists a need in water parks for a means of transportation through the park and between the rides. For water rides that involve the use of a floatation device (e.g., an inner tube or floating board), the walk back to the start of a ride can be particularly arduous if the rider has to carry the floatation device from the exit of the ride back to the start of the ride. Floatation devices may be transported from the exit to the entrance of the ride using mechanical transportation devices, but these devices are expensive to purchase and operate. Using a mechanical transportation device for the floatation device or having the guest walk with the floatation device may reduce guest enjoyment, cause excess wear and tear on the floatation devices, contribute to guest injuries, and make it impossible for some guests to access the rides. In addition, a park that includes many different non-integrated rides may require guests to use different floatation devices for different rides, which makes it difficult for the park operators to provide the guests with a general purpose floatation device. It is advantageous to standardize riding vehicles for rides as much as possible. Typically, water parks cover a large area. Guests may pass through an entrance and by a changing room area upon entering the park. Rides and picnic areas located in areas distant to the entrance may be underused in relation to rides and areas located near the entrance. Popular rides may be crowded, with guests waiting in queue lines for entry. This may lead to guest dissatisfaction and general reduction of optimal guest dispersal throughout the park. The lack of an efficient transportation system between rides accentuates this problem in water parks. Water parks may close intermittently due to inclement weather. Depending on the geographic location of the water park, the water park may be open less than half of the year. Water parks may be closed due to uncomfortably low temperatures associated with winter. Water parks may be closed due to inclement weather such as rain, thunderstorms, and/or any other type of weather conditions that might limit participant enjoyment and/or participant safety. Reducing the number of days the water park is open may lower the profitability of the water park. Water parks may encounter problems including issues with transporting people and potential participants to and from locally available temporary accommodations. Groups of people (e.g., families) may travel great distances to water parks to make a family trip or a vacation out of the experience. People may then rent temporary lodgings close to the water park. Some water parks may provide temporary accommodations for guests. This not only solves the problem of transporting guests from local accommodations, but also provides further revenue to the water park. Providing temporary accommodations to guests, however leads to additional problems. When a water park provides guest accommodations, greater amounts of land may be required to build the water park, thereby increasing costs of the water park. Increasing land requirements for water parks typically increases the distances of water parks from major metropolitan areas. Increasing distances from major metropolitan areas potentially increases time and/or money required of potential guests, consequently reducing potential numbers of guests as well as revenues. It is therefore desirable that new methods and systems be developed for providing lodgings easily accessible by water park guests. It is further desired that the methods and systems provide lodgings and/or facilities for water park guests that will not significantly increase the footprint of the water park.

Depending on the geographic location of the water park, the water park may be open less than half of the year. Water parks may be closed due to uncomfortably low temperatures associated with winter. Water parks may be closed due to inclement weather such as rain, thunderstorms, and/or any other type of weather conditions that might limit participant enjoyment and/or participant safety. Reducing the number of days the water park is open may lower the profitability of the water park. Water parks may encounter problems including issues with transporting people and potential participants to and from locally available temporary accommodations. Groups of people (e.g., families) may travel great distances to water parks to make a family trip or a vacation out of the experience. People may then rent temporary lodgings close to the water park. Some water parks may provide temporary accommodations for guests. This not only solves the problem of transporting guests from local accommodations, but also provides further revenue to the water park. Providing temporary accommodations to guests, however leads to additional problems. When a water park provides guest accommodations, greater amounts of land may be required to build the water park, thereby increasing costs of the water park. Increasing land requirements for water parks typically increases the distances of water parks from major metropolitan areas. Increasing distances from major metropolitan areas potentially increases time and/or money required of potential guests, consequently reducing potential numbers of guests as well as revenues. It is therefore desirable that new methods and systems be developed for providing lodgings easily accessible by water park guests. It is further desired that the methods and systems provide lodgings and/or facilities for water park guests that will not significantly increase the footprint of the water park.

8215051,Pest control materials,2007-06-14,1,1,"This invention relates to pest control materials. Mosquito nets act by providing a physical barrier to blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, thus preventing transmission of disease-causing pathogens to the user. The net does not kill or repel the insects, which continue to be attracted to the user because of the unrestricted passage of host odour and carbon dioxide across the mesh. The effectiveness of mosquito nets can be increased by treating them with non-volatile chemical insecticides, such as pyrethroids. These are considered to be relatively safe for the user at the recommended dose and have no fumigant effect. The net continues to act as a “baited trap” attracting insects which are irritated, knocked down and ultimately killed by the insecticide. Such nets continue to be effective even if damaged, provided the insect touches the treated fabric. To limit the dangers of intoxication to users during treatment and ensure more uniform coverage of the material with insecticide, mosquito nets are now sold with the insecticide already impregnated into the mesh. These require no further re-impregnation for 20-25 washes. These pre-impregnated nets retain some of the disadvantages of those left untreated or treated by the users, i.e., (a) leaching of insecticide into the environment where it may cause detrimental effects to non-target organisms, (b) danger of inducing resistance to the insecticide used and other related chemicals in the target population as well as other pests (c) possible health problems related to long-term use, particularly by pregnant women and children under five who have the most urgent requirement for protection from malaria or other insect-borne diseases and are thus most likely to use these insecticide-impregnated nets The present invention represents a pest-control method that does not incorporate conventional chemical insecticides but kills and/or repels mosquitoes and other insect pests. It can be used in mosquito nets and other pest control devices and materials, including protective clothing, garden or crop netting and fleeces, protective bands for fruit trees, horse blankets, hairnets and filters for grain stores or flour mills. It could thus also replace or enhance the performance of the following: (a) Midge screens or veils which require a very fine mesh to be effective (b) Insect repellents containing diethyltoluamide (DEET), citronella or other chemical which are effective for a limited period and may have health problems associated with their long-term use (c) Garden or crop netting (e.g. crop cover) and fleeces where mesh size or pore size again needs to be very fine, excluding the pest species but restricting the circulation of light, heat and moisture (d) Chemical pesticides used against agricultural and horticultural pests (costly, detrimental to the environment and non-target organisms) (e) Horse blankets that cause discomfort to animals because of their weight (f) Repellent sprays containing citronella and eucalyptus that have limited effectiveness and are disliked by horses (g) Sticky bands placed around trees to trap pests that climb the trunks (h) Anti-louse shampoos containing harmful insecticides (i) Fly screens that restrict air flow (j) Filters and window screens used in flour mills and grain stores (k) Insect electrocution devices (l) Slug control methods of all types including copper bands, rings, mats, baited traps that act by irritating the animals to such a degree that they do not attempt to cross the treated surface. (m) Slug pellets which contain active ingredients such as aluminium sulphate or chlorpyriphos (n) Covers to protect livestock from insect bites and to prevent downgrading of subsequent products due to defects (e.g. leather) (m) Window blinds, covers and screens in domestic and commercial buildings and transport to protect occupants from insects. The invention comprises a pest control material having a surface with microprojections. The material may comprise a textile yarn, filament or thread. The material may comprise a textile fabric. The material may comprise a net. The material may comprise a woven, knitted or non-woven fabric, or a combination of two or more such fabrics. The material may comprise a solid sheet, e.g. of rubber or plastic, and may comprise a rubber or plastic tree band. The surface may be a coating. The microprojections may comprise an abrasive material and/or an absorptive material, and may comprise silica, which may be in the form of diatomaceous earth, or polycarbonate. Other materials that can be used include ceramic, glass and polymer compositions or mixtures thereof, granules of kaolin clay, synthetic hydrated silica, bentonite, Fubasami clay and terra alba, talc, inorganic minerals such as sericite, quartz, sulphur, activated carbon, calcium carbonate and hydrated silica, silica gels, borates, and other polymers such as polyamide, PMMA and other hard and potentially recycled polymers. The microprojections may be of particles which may range in size from 5 μm upwards. The material may be washable. The material may incorporate a pest attractant. The pest attractant may comprise a semiochemical, such as a pheromone or kairomone. The material may incorporate a pathogen, which may be a microbial pathogen such as fungal or bacterial spores. The invention also comprises a method for controlling pests, comprising deploying any of the materials having microprojections above set forth. The material may be deployed as a physical barrier to pests, and may be deployed for example in dwelling houses, workplaces, animal houses, storage facilities and vehicles such as automobiles, trains and boats. The material may be deployed, for example, as a window screen or window blind, or may be deployed as or as part of a garment, such for example as a veil. It may, of course, be deployed as a bed or mosquito net. For animal protection, it may, for example, be deployed as a horse blanket. The material may be deployed to protect vegetation, such as trees and plants, and may be deployed as a tree band or plant ring, or as a crop tunnel, a cloche or protective netting. The material may be deployed as a filter, and the invention comprises a filter comprising the material and anything containing or designed to contain such a filter, such as an air conditioning system or a vacuum cleaner. The invention also comprises a method for making a pest control material, comprising causing a substrate to exhibit microprojections. The microprojections may be applied to the substrate in a coating. The microprojections may be abrasive and/or absorptive. Abrasive microparticles can abrade an insect exocuticle, allowing dehydration of the insect or ingress of pathogens, both of which can lead to deterioration of the condition of the insect and eventual death. The coating may be a conventional textile coating, such as latex or an acrylic resin or a thermoplastic or thermosetting adhesive, and may be applied in a conventional fashion, except, of course, as may be required to be modified by the inclusion of particulate material affording the microprojections. Generally speaking, the coating may be applied thinly, whereby to leave microprojections of particulate inclusion standing proud of the coating surface. The surface of the invention may be created by thinly coating using any appropriate type of coating substance (e.g. latex, acrylic or other binder resin) containing abrasive/absorptive particles that is washable. Alternatively, the surface of the invention may be created by thermofusing abrasive/absorptive particles to any appropriate type of substrate. The microprojections may consist of absorptive/abrasive material such as diatomaceous earth, which is already used as a dust for the control of a variety of insect pests or other particles that act as an abrasive against the insect exocuticle. It may also consist of other absorptive and/or abrasive materials such as polycarbonate, applied singly or mixed with diatomaceous earth in different proportions. The invention thus represents a more efficient, concentrated way of exposing insect pests to the desiccant microparticles. Assays in which mosquitoes are applied to netting coated with these microparticles reveal that the insects are repelled and survive significantly less time than those exposed to normal mesh. Death occurs as a result of dehydration following damage to the insect cuticle by contact with the microprojections. The insects are also more susceptible to attack by pathogenic fungi. Depending on the application for which it is to used, the invention may thus incorporate pathogens such as fungal spores as well as attractant semiochemicals (pheromones or kairomones)."
7949433,Sensor device for interrupting irrigation,2007-06-20,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the controlling of the execution of a watering program by an irrigation controller. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Rain sensors for use in the interruption of programmed watering schedules of an irrigation controller are generally known to include a material that is responsive to rain, and in the event a preset level of rain is exceeded, a switch is activated which outputs a signal to the irrigation controller that causes the controller to cease the execution of watering schedules. U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,499 to Runge et al. (which is incorporated herein by reference) describes a wireless rain sensor that uses a hygroscopic material that expands when exposed to water. When the hygroscopic material expands beyond a specified point or threshold, an integrated transmitter wirelessly transmits a radio frequency signal to a receiver attached to the controller. The receiver receives the wireless signal and causes the controller to cease watering. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,351 to Woytowitz (which is incorporated herein by reference) describes a wireless rain sensor including a hygroscopic material that is not mechanically connected to the switch that triggers the transmission of the wireless signal that will cause the interruption of watering The threshold level may be adjusted by a user through the mechanical adjustment of the distance the hygroscopic material must expand before actuating the switch, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,109 to Klinefelter et al (which is incorporated herein by reference). Thus, in order to exceed a selectable threshold, the hygroscopic material must expand a selectable distance, which corresponds to a selectable level of rain fall. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide methods and apparatus for permitting or interrupting irrigation using sensor equipment. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a method for controlling irrigation comprising the steps of: generating an indication representing the amount of rain fall at a sensor unit; transmitting a signal comprising at least the indication from the sensor unit to an interface unit, wherein the interface unit is adapted to cause an interruption of programmed watering schedules of an irrigation controller; receiving the signal at the interface unit; determining, based at least on the indication from the signal, whether irrigation should be interrupted; and generating an interrupt command to interrupt irrigation. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as a device for controlling irrigation comprising an interface unit. The interface unit comprises an input unit adapted to receive a signal from a sensor unit, the signal comprising an indication representing an amount of rain fall at the sensor unit. The interface unit also comprises a controller coupled to the input unit adapted to process the signal to determine based at least on the indication from the signal, whether irrigation executed by an irrigation controller should be interrupted and to generate an interrupt command to cause the interruption of the irrigation. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a rain sensor comprising: a moisture absorptive material adapted to move in response to rain fall; a plunger adapted to move in response to and proportional to the movement of the moisture absorptive material; and a sensor element. The sensor element comprises a first element and a second element coupled to the plunger and adapted to move with the plunger relative to the first element causing a change in a variable corresponding to the amount of rain. The rain sensor also comprises a controller adapted to measure the variable and further adapted to generate a signal comprising an indication of the amount of rain fall based on the variable. In yet another embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for wireless installation of an irrigation control device comprising the steps of: locating a first wireless unit at a first location; establishing a wireless path of communication between the first wireless unit and a second wireless unit remote from the first location; moving the second wireless unit to a plurality of possible installation locations, wherein the signal strength changes as the second wireless unit is moved; automatically determining the signal strength as the second wireless unit is moved; automatically displaying the signal strength at the second wireless unit as the second wireless unit is moved; and determining which of the plurality of possible installation locations to fix the second wireless unit based on the displayed signal strength. In a further embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a device for controlling irrigation comprising a sensor unit adapted to sense an amount of rain fall; a two-way communication link coupling the sensor unit to an interface unit; and the interface unit adapted to receive information corresponding to the amount of rain fall via the two-way communication link from the sensor unit. The interface unit is further adapted to cause an interruption of irrigation executed by an irrigation controller based at least in part on the information from the sensor unit. In another embodiment, the invention may be characterized as a method for controlling irrigation comprising the steps: sensing an amount of rain fall at a sensor unit; communicating information corresponding to the amount of rain fall from the sensor unit via a two-way communication link to an interface unit; and causing, at the interface unit, an interruption of irrigation executed by an irrigation controller based at least in part on the information from the sensor unit, the interface unit being adapted to communicate with the sensor unit via the two-way communication link."
7962244,Landscape irrigation time of use scheduling,2008-01-30,1,2,"The present invention relates to irrigation control as well as water and energy savings, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for use with existing controllers that are capable of implementing time of use (TOU) governmental landscape watering restrictions that override the operational schedule of such controllers. 1. Field of the Invention In order to conserve water, the irrigation industry, state government water related agencies, and local water districts have encouraged for several years the use of smart irrigation controllers to save water. Smart controllers are referred to as controllers that can adjust their irrigation schedule depending upon local environmental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind. These irrigation related measures have been taken because western states frequently experience drought conditions, making water supplies critical. Residential landscape irrigation accounts for 50% to 70% of all residential water use in California, Nevada, and Arizona. Current attempts to generate public education and interest for water conservation using “smart” irrigation controllers and modules that adjust themselves to accommodate for varying environmental conditions throughout the year have not proven effective. While theoretically irrigation efficient, they have not solved the problem of conserving water due to their extremely low voluntary user and installer participation. For example, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District (MWD) and its associated water districts provide water to 3.5 million residential and commercial customers in Southern California. To promote water conservation, the MWD has been promoting the use of “smart” irrigation controllers that adjust themselves to changing daily weather conditions, since customers generally fail or forget to adjust their non-smart irrigation controllers on their own. MWD's associated water districts have either provided a variety of smart controllers from well-known manufacturers either free of charge, or rebated up to 100%. The MWD reports that after 3 years of their smart controller rebate programs, less than 10,000 customers of the 3.5 million have tried to use these smart controllers. Of these, it is estimated that no more than 50% are properly used in their smart mode. This translates to far less than 1% effective usage, which would produce minimal water conservation. Another large water district, the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA—which, includes Las Vegas, Nev.), reports that in over two years, fewer than 100 controllers have been rebated in an area encompassing about 500,000 addresses. Other water districts report similarly poor response to smart controller programs. Some reasons for these mediocre results are set forth below: 1. Programming ET-based (ET=evapotranspiration) smart controllers can be complex. In addition to conventional programming that requires entry of watering days, start times and watering durations, ET-based controllers require entries of precipitation rates, crop coefficient factors, soil type, slope, percentage of shade, and/or other information which is not readily available to homeowners. 2. ET-based systems, which account for many smart controllers, require either an adjacent weather station, or the transmission of weather data from which ET is calculated or ET itself. The cost of a weather station is typically several times that of the controller. The ET data transmitted to smart controllers (if weather stations are not used) requires monthly service fees that can easily exceed the cost of the water saved. 3. Landscape maintenance contractors are reluctant to install such systems due to the numerous call backs to reprogram or re-explain smart controller programming to their customers. 4. Landscape contractors and landscape maintenance firms hesitate to train their personnel to learn to program as many as 20 different controllers in order for them to explain it to their residential and commercial customers. The high turnover rate of personnel makes it non-cost effective to train their installers. 5. The reluctance for a homeowner to trust tens of thousands of dollars of their landscaping to a controller they do not understand or cannot program. 6. Many ET-based controllers are not compatible with local watering schedules. ET-based controllers accumulate the daily ET value until some threshold is reached and then permit irrigation. The irrigation day determined by the ET-based controller may not be an allowed watering day. 7. Homeowners are used to seeing their controllers start cycles at certain times of the day on certain days of the week. Not observing irrigation causes them to wonder if their system is working. 8. California bill 1881 has postponed the enforcement of its mandatory smart controller requirements to January 2012, removing the urgency to convert to smart controllers. 9. Low cost of water in many areas due to government subsidies. 10. Lax or inadequate enforcement of water rules. In recent years, “smart” controllers (that adjust themselves to changing daily weather conditions) have been promoted for landscape water conservation. Different approaches to “smart” irrigation control are disclosed in this inventor's patents and publications (U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,058,478 and 7,266,428 and 2007/0293990); and a wide variety of ET-based patents such as Hopkins U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,861; Marian U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,855; Oliver U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,302; Sieminski U.S. Pat. No. 6,823,239; Addink U.S. Pat. No. 6,892,114; Addink U.S. Pat. No. 6,895,987, and Mecham U.S. Pat. No. 6,314,340, among others. The latter group of smart controllers utilize ET methods which calculate the theoretical amount of water required to properly irrigate various types of landscapes with varying sprinkler precipitation rates and soil conditions. ET has been studied for 50 years and as many as twenty equations have been developed to calculate ET, which is then converted to minutes of watering duration. Smart water theory as represented by the numerous ET equations is not necessarily accurate. It is therefore possible that more water can be wasted using ET-based controllers because they are more difficult to understand and program than conventional (non-smart) controllers, particularly if the wrong ET equation is used. Highlighting this possibility, Catteano and Upham conducted a study (“Methods to Calculate Evapotranspiration: Differences and Choices”) that showed that four of these recognized ET equations varied as much as 70% from each other at certain times of the year. Thus, not only is ET theory difficult to understand and not practical to use, as noted above, the various ET equations do not agree with each other. In addition to the shortcomings of ET-based smart controllers, and the general non-agreement between ET equations, the hydraulic parameters upon which ET controllers depend to convert the inches of ET to station run times are not exact either. Entry of the precipitation rate required to calculate the watering duration from an ET value assumes a first time observation and measurement of that precipitation rate, or use of the manufacturers estimated data. The precipitation rate for a specific sprinkler is based upon the system operating pressure, proper operation of the sprinkler, and the operating efficiency of the valve. Every one of these parameters may vary daily. Furthermore, additional construction of homes in developing areas will cause changes in operating water pressure, water supply, pumping capability, and delivery. The efficiency of pumping systems also varies because of the age and maintenance of the pumps. For all of the above reasons, smart ET-based technology is not an exact science, and no amount of theoretical calculations of ET will save real water unless the system is installed, programmed, and operating properly, including the effectiveness of the infrastructure. Fifty years of research has not given us an answer as to which ET method is accurate. Even the modified Pennman-Montieth ET equation (see patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,266,428), generally accepted by most agencies, is considered to over water by at least 20%. A high level of usage of ET or smart systems, in theory could help conserve water, but does little to address energy, pumping and delivery issues. Separate from the need for water conservation, to address infrastructure shortcomings such as pumping, water delivery, and operating water pressure, some communities have limited the hours and days of allowable irrigation by specifying, for example, even or odd street address watering schedules, watering groups, times during the day when watering is prohibited, limiting watering to even or odd calendar days, or certain interval(s) of days, etc. In most instances, after an initial education period, these methods have proven to be easier to adhere to and more effective in water conservation than smart controllers. The problem with this voluntary approach is that it still requires the homeowner or landscape contractor responsible for the maintenance of commercial sites to return to each site a number of times a year to manually reprogram each controller, in addition to their normal maintenance responsibilities. The SNWA estimates that near full compliance to their mandated watering schedules (without any smart controller usage) would save at least 10% of the entire annual water needs (residential, commercial and industrial) in Clark County Nevada, which includes Las Vegas. This is important because the cost of upgrading the infrastructure or importing water from the Northern-Sierra Nevada could run into the billions of dollars. Based upon a study sponsored by the Irrigation Association, most irrigation users are not willing to or are incapable of changing their schedules as required during the course of the year. It is therefore desirable to provide inexpensive, easily installable, easily programmable, automated, non-smart, add-on irrigation control methods and apparatus that operate independent of environmental conditions, system hydraulics, or controller size or model that automate implementation of governmentally established watering restrictions. This approach has the potential to save hundreds of times more real water than any existing smart controller. In addition, in locations with rapidly increasing population, the device would alleviate the pumping and delivery problems of the available water thereby also saving energy pumping costs. Energy and water are two resources that are critical to any community that need to be conserved and managed. Energy conservation has been promoted by electric utilities in many communities for years in the following ways: 1. In California in the 1990's, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison offered programs to agricultural customers that significantly reduced their electric rates if they abstained from using their irrigation pumps during certain times of the day. 2. Electric utility companies offered rate incentives for residences that reduced their power usage during peak times of the day, particularly in the summer. It was less expensive to offer power credits or reduced rates than to build new power plants and lines. 3. These power utility companies also had “rolling brownouts” that selectively turned off parts of cities to save energy during heat waves that exceeded the power grid demand capabilities of power generation and delivery. 4. Today, certain electric companies are proposing to control thermostats during certain times of the day to help conserve energy. This would be presumably accomplished with the installation of a wireless device that can control either the heater/air conditioner, or the temperature setting itself. All of the above attempts are exclusively related to energy conservation during certain times of the day. It would therefore be desirable to conserve both water and energy by reducing the use of additional pumps or larger horsepower pumps by providing an inexpensive, easily installable, easily programmable, non-smart, automated, add-on irrigation control methods and apparatus to automate implementation of governmentally established watering restrictions. 2. Description of the Prior Art A number of modules or add-on devices are available which attach to existing conventional controllers to make them smart and theoretically save water. Among them is the invention disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,892,114. This patent discloses monitoring of the inrush and holding currents output from the controller in order to “learn” the initial programmed station run times. After calculating desired run times from supplied environmental parameters, the controller outputs are cut off at the new calculated time. The cut offs fluctuate from day to day depending on the environmental parameters and the calculations. In another embodiment, ET values are accumulated until a minimum threshold value is reached before irrigation occurs. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,895,987, an irrigation scheduler automatically modifies irrigation schedules of installed irrigation controllers to affect irrigating of the landscape based on the water requirements of the landscape plants, and calculates a daily ET value which is then used to control the output of the controller. Publication No. 2004/0039489 describes wireless transmission of various environmental data such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind, and rainfall to calculate an ET value in a module attached to the output of an irrigation controller which then modifies its schedule. This design is manufactured by Weather Reach and commercially marketed by Rain Bird. The August 2007 edition of Weather and Soil Moisture Based Landscape Irrigation Scheduling Devices (published by the U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation) describes a number of currently manufactured “smart” irrigation control devices, including: a weather station by Hunter Industries which provides environmental data to a module attached to their controllers which calculates a daily ET and provides it to the controller which then determines if, when, and how much to irrigate; add-on modules made by Water2Save, Micromet, and Eco Research which are dependent upon environmental or ET-based data to govern various controller outputs or irrigation schedules. Ground moisture sensors as add-on devices are also disclosed in the Bureau of Reclamation publication such as those provided by Irrometer, Acclima, Dynamax, Lawn Logic, and Watermonics. These devices measure soil moisture to determine the need for irrigation. It is apparent from the foregoing that a number of “smart” add-on modules are currently available that are designed to manage the outputs of irrigation controllers based on changing environmental conditions. However, all of these inventions are dependent upon environmental factors or ground moisture to calculate or determine the time, duration, or frequency of irrigation cycles. In contrast, the present invention does not use real time environmental data, any additional equipment such as weather stations, stored historical weather data, transmitted or calculated weather data, or any form of ET to control an irrigation controller's output(s), nor does it monitor the outputs of existing controllers, or adjust the irrigation schedule based upon the landscape vegetation plant needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides simple automated methods and apparatus for water conservation and energy savings that balance the infrastructure demands for water delivery by facilitating easy compliance with a community's watering regulations and restrictions as imposed by local governmental authorities. The present invention saves water and energy, improves irrigation efficiency, and saves the cost of infrastructure upgrading using simple methods and apparatus that have heretofore not been contemplated with any existing technology. In one of its preferred embodiments, a programmable module is provided that is easily attached to any existing irrigation controller. The existing controller may be powered by batteries, AC, DC, solar, or ambient light, and it may be a conventional or smart controller. The irrigation system may also be a central system where a central unit or computer directs the slave controllers in the local community when to irrigate. The module of the present invention may be powered by any suitable source including without limitation batteries, AC, DC, solar, ambient light, etc. A microprocessor incorporated within the module keeps the current time of day, calendar, and contains a specific watering schedule(s) determined by a local governmental authority. In some embodiments, the device is installed in series on the common electrical line between the controller and its valves, and is capable of breaking that line to prevent the valve solenoids from activating, thereby only allowing watering during the designated days or hours, depending upon the requirements imposed by the local governmental authority. These requirements may allow watering at different times depending upon such things as the address or location where the module is installed, the season, the date and/or the time of day. In these embodiments, only two wires need to be attached to any existing controller. In some embodiments, the module may be pre-programmed with one or more different pre-determined watering restrictions as established by a local governmental authority. For example, a local municipality may have watering restrictions as follows: during designated summer months, watering of even-numbered addresses is allowed on certain days and odd-numbered addresses allowed on different days, but no watering is allowed at any address during certain daylight hours; during non-summer months different watering days and times are allowed. An embodiment of a module of the present invention may have four sets of pre-programming, and a switch, button or other means on the module to select one of them: (1) summer-odd, (2) summer-even, (3) winter-odd, and (4) winter-even. Depending on the address where the module is used (even or odd) and the season of the year (summer or winter), the user can easily set the module so that it follows the correct watering schedule for that particular time and location. It is to be understood that embodiments of the present invention encompass the capability to have pre-programming for additional restrictions depending upon the regulations of the local governmental authority. More sophisticated embodiments may include an internal clock that is set to the correct date and time in order to automatically switch between pre-programmed summer, fall, winter, spring or other watering schedules. Such embodiments may not include any switches or switch settings, or they may include simple switches or settings such as “even-odd” to designate the address of the location. In other embodiments, separate modules may be provided without switches, for example one containing pre-programming for use with even-numbered addresses, and another containing pre-programming for use with odd numbered addresses. In other embodiments, additional programming and/or separate modules may also be provided for commercial as opposed to residential use, if different restrictions are imposed for commercial and residential properties by the local governmental authority. It is to be appreciated that multiple modules, or multiple switches, switch settings, buttons, or the like may be provided with modules of the present invention, to provide a selection of pre-programming options, and that a wide variety of different combinations of switch-selectable options may be implemented on different modules with or without an internal clock. In other embodiments, the modules of the present invention may be provided with an input for receiving updated programming. In some embodiments, such input may be in the form of a connector (e.g., USB, Ethernet, telephone jack, etc.) to which a cable is attached to download programming from an external source such as a USB flash drive (memory stick), computer or the Internet. This allows the programming in the module to be updated in the event of changes by the local governmental authority. In other embodiments, the module may include a reader that may receive a card, strip or other article having a magnetic strip or other means for holding data/programming that may be read and implemented by the module. These embodiments allow the local governmental authority to provide updates by simply mailing out cards, strips, or other convenient data transfer devices, by making programming updates available on line through the Internet, or by having a technician drop by to download the programming from a portable device. In other embodiments, the module may be provided with a receiver that is capable of receiving a wireless transmission from another source to provide programming. The transmission may include initial programming from the local governmental authority, updated programming (e.g., for the current season), or emergency programming in the event the local governmental authority imposes unexpected restrictions (such as in the case of a worsening drought). The programming may be broadcast from a single central source, or from multiple sources, or technicians may travel through neighborhoods with transmitters to broadcast updated programming to locally affected areas. In other embodiments, the module of the present invention may be attached to a master valve at a location to hydraulically disable the water supply at that location. In other embodiments, the watering schedules of the local governmental authority may be incorporated within a new controller, (conventional or smart) without the need for an external module to override the controller's programmed watering schedules. In preferred embodiments of the invention, it is self-(battery) powered in order to be surge proof and electrically safe. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for implementing time of use regulations from local governmental water authorities within their territories. It is also an object of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for easily implementing changes or updates to time of use regulations from local governmental water authorities within their territories. It is also an object of the present invention to provide simple and effective methods and apparatus for water and energy conservation. It is also an object of the present invention to provide simple, low cost, and effective methods and apparatus to alleviate significant infrastructure upgrade costs (pumping systems, water delivery systems, sewage treatment plants, etc.) by balancing water demands within communities. It is also an object of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus that are simple enough that virtually any end user can afford, install, and/or program the invention without the need for an electrician or other professional. In many instances, the device may be provided free of charge by the local water agency. A very cost effective module that is simple to install and program, provided free of charge, that reduces, simplifies or eliminates user reprogramming and contractor call backs with no monthly service fee, greatly improves the likelihood of high compliance that will save significant money in terms of water, energy, and infrastructure upgrading. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an add-on module or controller that may be used with virtually any irrigation system anywhere in the world to implement time of use regulations from local governmental water authorities with only slight software modifications specific to a region or country. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a built-in module for an existing controller for implementing time of use regulations from local governmental water authorities. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an add-on module that may be used in conjunction with a master valve at a location to cut off the water supply at that location. Additional objects of the invention will be apparent from the detailed descriptions and the claims herein."

No. 60/922,441, which was filed on Apr. 9, 2007; U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/933,173, which was filed on Jun. 5, 2007; U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/936,945, which was filed on Jun. 23, 2007. The invention relates to an apparatus for winterizing an irrigation system, such as a sprinkler system, and a method for winterizing an irrigation system by draining excess fluid from the system. Irrigation systems are well-known and can be found in wide-spread use. Typical systems include at least one length of pipe having a number of sprinkler heads distributed so as to cover a desired pattern for watering. The pipe, or pipes in the case of a multiple-zone system, is usually buried underground, with the sprinkler heads rising above ground level at least during use. If, during the winter months, the frost level extends below the level of the pipe, water within the pipe can expand as the temperature approaches freezing and can damage the pipe or other components of the system. For at least this reason, it is important to “winterize” an irrigation system by draining a substantial portion of the water left in the system when not in use. Conventional winterizing systems use compressed air to blow excess fluid from the interior of the sprinkler system. However, compressed air can damage underground appliances and fixtures such as sprinkler heads, hose connectors, zone valves, and water delivery lines. Compressed air can also flutter backflow prevention valve seals. This can damage the backflow prevention valve and cause it to fail. Systems with faulty backflow prevention valves are at risk of allowing water to siphon back into plumbing lines, which can contaminate drinking water. An improved system is needed that will remove water and other fluids from irrigation lines to avoid damage from frost. Preferably, such a system would not require operation by a qualified service person, and would not be likely to damage components of the irrigation system. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a system that is contemplated for use with household and commercial irrigation and sprinkler systems, and not on indoor plumbing systems. The system of the invention uses negative pressure to remove fluid from the irrigation/sprinkler system, rather than using compressed air as in conventional systems. According to an aspect of the invention, an irrigation system draining apparatus is adapted for use with an irrigation system having a conduit with a fluid source connection, an air inlet, and at least one output port. The apparatus includes a suction device having an input port that is adapted to access an interior of the conduit, for example, by being sealed against one of the output ports, and to drain fluid from the conduit by suction when the fluid source connection is closed and the air inlet is open. The suction device can include a suction head, a suction nozzle, and an effluent port. The suction head has a motor and an impeller adapted to create negative air pressure, and an exhaust vent. The suction nozzle is connected to the suction head and is adapted to be sealed against one output port of the irrigation system such that the negative air pressure created by the suction head is applied to the interior of the conduit. The effluent port is connected to the suction head and is adapted to discharge fluid drained from the conduit by the suction head through the suction nozzle. The suction device can also include a collection chamber and a fluid release valve. The collection chamber is disposed between the suction head and the effluent port, and is adapted to store fluid drained from the conduit. The fluid release valve is coupled to the effluent port and is adapted to control discharge of the fluid from the collection chamber. The collection chamber can include a fluid level indicator. The suction device can be a portable unit. For example, the suction head can be arranged above the suction nozzle so as to be supported at least in part by the suction nozzle when the suction nozzle is sealed against the output port of the irrigation system and the suction device is in use. The suction device can also include a collection tube disposed between the suction nozzle and the suction head. Alternatively, the suction device can include a housing and a flexible collection tube disposed between the suction nozzle and the suction head. Wheels can be coupled to the housing to provide rolling support for the device. The apparatus of the invention can be adapted for use with an irrigation system having a number of conduits, where each conduit has at least one output port, a fluid source connection coupled to the conduits by a respective number of valves, and an air inlet. In this case, the apparatus of the invention can also include a control device that is adapted to open and close individual valves automatically, to coordinate with use of the suction device on output ports of the respective conduits. The control device can also be adapted to control operation of the suction device. For example, the control device can be adapted to sequentially open and close individual valves, and can be adapted to cycle through the sequence at a predetermined rate. The control device can also be adapted to open and close the fluid source connection. The control device can include a processor. In this case, the apparatus can also include a remote input device that is adapted to accept user inputs and provide corresponding input signals to the processor. Also, the zone valves can be incorporated as part of the invention, as a processor-controllable valve assembly such as a rotary valve, to be controlled by the control device processor. The apparatus of the invention can also include a parameter-reading device that is adapted to provide parameter data to the processor. The control device can be adapted to actuate the apparatus automatically when the parameter data provided to the processor falls within a predetermined range. For example, the parameter data can be temperature data, and the predetermined range can be values of temperature data corresponding to temperature below a predetermined threshold, preferably for a predetermined time. Thus, when the measured temperature falls below a certain value, the control device will automatically actuate the apparatus to drain the conduit(s). The suction device and the control device can be integrated and adapted to be connected to the irrigation system as a unitary device. The apparatus of the invention can include a number of control devices. Each control device can be adapted to open and close a respective one valve automatically, to coordinate with use of the suction device on output ports of the respective conduits. In this way, the apparatus of the invention provides for central control of drainage of a number of conduits in the irrigation system, or individual in-line control of each conduit. According to another aspect of the invention, a method of draining an irrigation system includes closing a fluid source connection for the irrigation system. An air inlet of the irrigation system is opened. Fluid is drained from the irrigation system conduit through the output port using a suction device. Prior to draining the fluid, one or more output ports can be sealed closed Using the suction device in this manner can include sealing a suction nozzle against the output port. The suction nozzle is connected to a suction head having a motor and an impeller adapted to create negative air pressure, and an exhaust vent. The fluid drained from the conduit is discharged through an effluent port. The fluid drained from the conduit can also be stored in a collection chamber prior to discharge of the fluid, which can be controlled by using a fluid release valve coupled to the effluent port. The collection chamber can include a fluid level indicator. The suction device can be provided as a portable unit, which can be used by sealing the suction nozzle against the one output port and arranging the suction head above the suction nozzle so as to be supported at least in part on the suction nozzle. The suction device can be provided with a collection tube disposed between the suction nozzle and the suction head. Alternatively, the portable suction device can include a housing and a flexible collection tube disposed between the suction nozzle and the suction head. The housing can be provided with wheels for rolling support. Opening and closing of a number of valves for a respective number of conduits of the irrigation system can be automatically controlled to coordinate with use of the suction device using a control device. The control device can also be used to control operation of the suction device. For example, individual valves can be sequentially opened and closed using the control device, which can also control cycling through the sequence at a predetermined rate. The control device can also control opening and closing the fluid source connection. The method of the invention can also include providing user inputs to a remote input device. Input signals corresponding to the user inputs can be sent to a processor of the control device by the remote input device. Parameter data can also be provided to the processor from a parameter-reading device. If the received parameter data falls within a predetermined range, the method of the invention can be actuated automatically by the control device. For example, the parameter data can be temperature data and the predetermined range can be values of temperature data corresponding to a temperature below a predetermined threshold. Thus, when the measured temperature falls below a certain value, the control device will automatically actuate the apparatus to drain the conduit(s). The suction device and the control unit can be connected to the irrigation system as an integrated unit. A number of suction devices can be provided, and the control device can be used to operate a respective suction device automatically to coordinate with draining of a respective conduit. In this way, the method of the invention provides for central control of drainage of a number of conduits in the irrigation system, or individual in-line control of each conduit."
7877168,Evapotranspiration unit for re-programming an irrigation controller,2008-07-21,1,1,"The present invention relates to electronic irrigation controllers that selectively actuate valves to supply water to sprinklers for irrigating turf and landscaping. In many parts of the world due to inadequate rainfall it is necessary at certain times during the year to artificially water turf and landscaping. An ideal irrigation system for turf and landscaping should utilize a minimum number of valves, supply lines and sprinklers. Preferably the valves should be turned ON and OFF by an inexpensive, yet reliable electronic irrigation controller that is easy to program and can carry out a wide variety of watering schedules. The goal is to uniformly distribute the optimum amount of water over a given area. The type, placement and flow rates for each of the sprinklers are pre-selected when an irrigation system is designed and/or installed. The optimum flow rate provided by each sprinkler should preferably fall within plus or minus one-quarter gallon-per minute (GPM). The amount of water supplied by each sprinkler is largely determined by the size and configuration of its nozzle orifice(s), although variations result from fluctuations in water pressure that cannot be fully negated with regulators. Residential and commercial irrigation systems typically include one or more solenoid operated valves that are turned ON and OFF by the electronic irrigation controller. The valves admit water to various subterranean branch lines usually made of PVC pipe that typically have several sprinklers connected to risers coupled to the branch lines at spaced intervals. Each combination of a solenoid valve and its associated sprinklers is referred to in the irrigation industry as a station or zone. A modern electronic irrigation controller typically includes a microprocessor that executes one or more watering programs. The watering programs can, typically, be pre-programmed by the user via push button and/or rotary controls. The watering programs contain one or more watering schedules which consist of run and cycle times for each station. The controller usually has an LCD or other display to facilitate programming by the user. Often the controller will revert to a default watering program in the case of a power failure. The microprocessor controls the solenoid valves via suitable drivers and switching devices. The valves are opened and closed by the microprocessor in accordance with the pre-programmed run and cycle times for each of the stations. Homeowners, conservationists and water purveyors are increasingly interested in minimizing the amount of water used for irrigation, especially in areas where water is in short supply. Some municipalities have enacted restrictions on residential and commercial watering. While such restrictions do save water, they are often arbitrary and do not take into account the watering needs of different types of vegetation in different geographic locations. Techniques have been developed for tailoring watering schedules in an electronic irrigation controller to accommodate different kinds of plants and atmospheric conditions based on evapotranspiration (ET) rate. This is a number that represents the amount of water lost by a plant via evaporation and also the amount of water lost by the plant through transpiration, i.e. loss of water through its leaves. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,097,861 granted Mar. 24, 1992 to Hopkins et al. and assigned to Hunter Industries, Inc. of San Marcos, Calif., which discloses a controller that utilizes stored historic ET data for each zip code, along with other stored data, to calculate watering schedules. The primary environmental factors needed to calculate ET are temperature, amount of solar radiation, relative humidity and wind speed. Rainfall is not included because it is only a source of water and has little effect on how quickly plants lose water. However, an irrigation controller should take into account the effective rainfall, via rain interrupt sensor or otherwise, in determining the optimum watering schedule. Effective rainfall depends upon such things as soil type, slope and root depth as these determine the amount of water that actually makes it to the plant roots as opposed to the amount of runoff. Atmospheric conditions affect both evaporation and transpiration. Plant type also affects transpiration. Conventional techniques for using ET data in an irrigation controller often require a fee to be paid for receiving and utilizing the ET information. Irrigation controllers capable of calculating watering schedules based on ET are typically complicated to use and expensive to buy. Those schedulers which “piggy back” onto an existing controller have limitations because they can only reduce the existing watering schedules in the base controller. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, an evapotranspiration (ET) unit includes a first communication link, a processor and a second communication link. The first communication link receives actual ET data from a plurality of environmental sensors. The processor calculates changes to a set of watering schedules of a predetermined watering program based on the actual ET data. The changes can increase or decrease the frequency and/or length of ON times for selected stations. The second communication link transmits the changes to a separate irrigation controller."
8256160,Compressed growing medium,2009-02-09,1,1,"BACKGROUND Pre-seeded soil mixtures, such as germinating mixes, potting soils, peat cubes and compressed pellets, have been used in forestry, agricultural, commercial and home uses. These mixtures contain seeds dispersed in a soil mixture that is later deposited to allow the seeds to germinate and grow. These mixtures thus obviate time-consuming labor, such as digging, tilling and cultivating. Some mixtures are also used in indoor and outdoor pots and planters. Most soil mixtures are usually free from insects, diseases and weeds and have enough fertilizer incorporated for the first few weeks of plant growth. However, because of the favorable environment provided by the soil mixtures the seeds tend to germinate during storage or transport of the soil mixture before the mixture is deposited for its intended use. The seedlings are bulky and often become root-bound, resulting in limited time periods for storage transportation. They are also exposed to injury and to unfavorable environmental conditions, resulting in excessively high mortality rates of the seedlings. In order to prevent easy germination and seed mortality, soil mixtures have been compressed into soil wafers or pellets to provide easy modes of transporting the soil mixtures while limiting the water necessary for germination. However, these compressed wafers and do not effectively prevent water intrusion or germination of the seeds. A growing medium includes a bulking agent and a water-retentive polymer blended together and compressed at a volume-to-volume ratio ranging from about 2:1 to about 10:1, preferably from about 5:1 to about 10:1, and more preferably from about 7:1 to about 8:1, and being substantially free of a water-soluble binder material."
9181137,Micronutrient fertilizers and methods of making and using the same,2010-03-19,1,1,"The present inventions generally relate to fertilizers, and in particular to water insoluble slow-release micronutrient fertilizers, produced by incomplete polymerization of metal orthophosphate. Micronutrients are generally thought to be essential building blocks for plants and animals. Such micronutrients may include boron, chlorine, chromium, cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. Micronutrient plant fertilization, alone or in combination with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash fertilization, generally results in better crop yields and more nutritious food. Prior micronutrient fertilizers include sulfate salts of the micronutrients, such as zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate and cuprous sulfate or chelates such as zinc EDTA, iron EDTA and copper EDTA. These water-soluble compounds, however, can be leached out of the soil and contaminate water bodies. Other water soluble micronutrient fertilizers have been impregnated with an organic polymer membrane. The nutrients may be released into a solution by diffusion. Still further micronutrient fertilizers have been produced having relatively low micronutrients. Iron and manganese fertilizers are widely used in many parts of the world particularly in soils of high pH, such as the black soils. They are also widely used in horticultural and cash crops to improve yields and quality of produce. The compounds most popularly used for correcting deficiencies of iron and manganese in crops are ferrous sulphate and manganous sulphate (J. J. Mortvedt, P. M. Giordano & W. L. Lindsay, 1972, Micronutrients in Agriculture, Soil Sci. Soc. Am., Madison). Chelated forms of these micronutrients, e.g., iron-EDTA, and manganese—EDTA compounds are also in use as liquid sprays (V. Saucheli, 1967, Chemistry and technology of fertilizers, Reinhold, N.Y.; G. H. Collins, 1955, Commercial fertilizers, Mc-Graw Hill, New York). There are, however, several drawbacks in the use of such soluble compounds as fertilizers, e.g., leaching losses, chemical transformation losses, ground water contamination, etc. This results in excess dosages which are often several times the actual crop uptake, leading to poor fertilize-use efficiency. Moreover, such wastages also affect the economics, thereby discouraging their widespread usage. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, slow-release fertilizers incorporating micronutrients have been prepared. One such type is the fertilizer based on phosphate glasses known as frits. Frits are prepared by fusing sodium, potassium or ammonium dihydrogen phosphates together with micronutrient salts at temperatures between 800° and 1400° C. and then rapidly quenching the melt to produce a glass (G. J. Roberts 1973, Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull. Vol 52, p 383; ibid, idem, Vol 54, p 1069; Austrian Patent No 326160 of 1975; U.S. Pat. No. 3,574,591 of 1971; U.S. Pat. No. 2,713,536 of 1974). The major disadvantage of the phosphate glass frits is that the availability of the nutrients is by slow hydrolysis of the glass and is highly dependent on the soil (pH, moisture content, temperature, etc.,) and on the crop (rate of growth, physiological factors, variety, etc). Consequently, where nutrient release by hydrolysis does not match plant uptake, the fertilizer is not effective. Moreover, the high temperatures involved in the synthesis of frits together with the corrosive conditions make these materials fairly expensive and unsuitable for general use. Another type of phosphate based water insoluble fertilizer is the metaphosphate. Metaphosphates of calcium and potassium together with micronutrients have been proposed (S I Volfkovich, 1972, J Appl. Chem. (USSR) Vol 45, p 2479). A Russian patent (SU 1270148 of 1986) describes the production of mixed metaphosphates based fertilizers produced at 500-880° C. Drawbacks in the use of metaphosphates as fertilizers are similar to those with the frits. Metaphosphates may be more insoluble and hydrolyse even slower, producing compounds with very poor nutrient availability. Metaphosphates of the heavy metals are extremely insoluble and of little use as fertilizers. An additional type of slow-release fertilizer has been produced in which the micronutrient ions are in a chemical form wherein they are insoluble but also plant available. These belong to the bio-release types of slow-release fertilizers. The processes for producing such phosphate based zinc and copper fertilizers are described in two Indian patents (Nos 172800 of 1990 and 177205 of 1991). The chemistry of zinc and copper phosphate polymerisation and the chemical nature of these fertilizers have also been described (S K Ray, C Varadachari & K Ghosh, 1993, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. Vol. 32, p. 1218; S K Ray, C Varadachari & K Ghosh, 1997, J. Agric. Food Chem., vol. 45, p. 1447). A patent (C. Varadachari, Indian Patent Application No. 10/CAL/99) describes the processes for production of slow-release fertilizers and describes methods for assessing limits of polymerisation.

8620480,Irrigation water conservation with automated water budgeting and time of use technology,2010-11-29,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to landscape water conservation by automating the water budget feature of irrigation controllers, that have heretofore been manually set. The present invention relates to the management and conservation of irrigation water, primarily for, but not limited to, residential, commercial, and municipal landscaping applications. More specifically, numerous automated methods and apparatus are provided for adjusting irrigation schedule intervals or station run times using simplified water budgeting methods that use pre-determined periodic environmental water budgeting percentage data (compiled into bell shaped water budget percentage curves) based upon the time of year, location, or both. The pre-determined water budgeting percentage data may be used independently or with current environmental data and/or local watering restrictions, and/or with one or more environmental sensors, and then used to adjust irrigation run times, watering intervals, watering days, or watering times of the day to conserve landscape water. Physical embodiments may be provided within controllers, as add-ons or plug-ins, or with central irrigation systems to provide automation of water budgeting, a common manual feature of most landscape irrigation controllers. 2. Description of the Prior Art Many regions of the United States lack sufficient water resources to satisfy all of their competing agricultural, urban, commercial and environmental needs. The “California Water Plan Update” published in 2009 by the California Department of Water Resources indicates that 80 million acre feet (maf) of water is needed to satisfy the annual water needs of the State of California. Of this amount, approximately forty-six percent is required for environmental purposes, forty-three percent for agricultural purposes, and eleven percent (approximately 8.8 maf) for urban use. Of this urban amount, 70% is for residential use, of which 50% is for landscaping. The California Department of Water Resources, the EPA, and the Irrigation Association (IA) among others, have encouraged landscape water conservation with the use of “Smart” water technology with smart irrigation controllers, rain sensors, and soil moisture sensors. A smart controller is generally defined as one that can adjust its irrigation schedule daily based upon current weather or environmental conditions. Performance standards have been set to determine the level of efficiency for each of these products with Smart Water Application Technology (SWAT) testing conducted at the Center for Irrigation Technology in Fresno, Calif. Twenty irrigation controllers have undergone this testing to date with results posted on the IA web site. To date, all but three of the successfully tested controllers have been evapotranspiration (ET) based. The three non ET tested products use temperature budgeting, this inventor's technology presented in presented in parent pending application Ser. No. 11/879,700, grand parent U.S. Pat. No. 7,266,428, great grandparent U.S. Pat. No. 7,058,478, and provisional application 60/465,457 filed on Apr. 25, 2003. These results can be noted in FIGS. 9A , 9 B, and 9 C. To further encourage the use of smart controllers, many water districts are offering rebates for those controllers that are posted in the IA web site with SWAT results. Soil moisture sensors and rain switches are the next set of smart devices that will be SWAT tested and posted. Controller add-ons and plug-ins have also recently started to be SWAT tested, such as the Hunter Solar Sync, the Irritrol Climate Logic, and this inventor's Universal Smart Module (see FIG. 9C ). A distinction is made between an add-on or plug-in. Both are devices outside an irrigation controller and designed to make existing conventional (non smart) controllers smart. However, an add-on is typically mounted on the output of an irrigation controller and usually breaks the common line to control irrigation. As such, an add-on can normally make any existing controller smart. A plug-in provides data directly to the irrigation controller microprocessor and must normally be compatible with a certain brand or model controller. As stated in this applicant's previous applications, ET based controllers, add-ons and plug-ins, while theoretically effective, were projected to be far too complicated or expensive or required monthly service fees to be an effective practical means for meaningful water conservation. Since 2003, this fact has not changed. The industry is still searching for products that provide real water conservation rather than theoretical water conservation. After seven years, still far fewer than 1% of irrigation controllers installed are smart, and many of them were installed only because they were provided free of charge or highly rebated. Furthermore, studies have shown that within one year of installation, less than half of those ET based smart controllers are still being used in their Smart mode. This fact was underscored by the AquaCraft study of weather based irrigation controllers (WBIC) sponsored by the California Department of Water Resources in 2009 that showed that the 3112 ET based smart controllers installed throughout California, only a 6% average water saving was recorded. Manufacturers had boasted that based on ET theory, 30-40% water savings would be possible. At least fifteen different ET equations have been developed over the last fifty years. In FIG. 8 , described in detail below, Cattaneo and Upham show four of those ET based data which indicate that the Pennman-Monteith data which is the standard used by the IA, DWR, and the FAO (food and agriculture office), is at certain times of the year as much as sixty percent different than the other three equations which all use the same CIMIS data. The California Energy Commission was formed to provide recommendations to DWR for the implementation of California Assembly Bill 1881 concerning limiting the sale of smart controllers in California after January 2012. Due to the poor performance of ET based controllers, the Commission has suspended its meetings, leaving the implementation of bill 1881 in doubt. The reasons for its suspension are disagreement within the industry, disappointment of ET based controller performance, very poor sales of smart controllers in spite of rebates, and the state of California's economy. All of these indicate that still after nearly a decade of ET and four decades of promoting soil moisture sensors, there is no clear consensus in the industry and government agencies as was originally predicted in this inventor's '478 patent. In addition to the need for water conservation, many urban areas do not have the infrastructure necessary to serve their communities, which include pumping, delivery, and water pressure issues. As a consequence, many water districts have implemented restricted watering schedules to stabilize water deliveries and save water. These restrictions normally require periodic manual changes to irrigation schedules for compliance. An automated way to insure compliance would also be beneficial for both water conservation and infrastructure relief. Ideally, both smart technology and automated water restrictions could be incorporated within an irrigation controller or add-on or plug-in device to offer a choice to the water district depending upon their local conditions and needs. This subject referred to as “Time of Use” was explained by pending application Ser. No. 11/879,700 which is incorporated in its entirety herein. The present invention provides embodiments addressing both needs. The present invention nor its predecessors do not state that ET and soil moisture based methods are not possible ways to help conserve water, but as currently embodied in other controllers (see Bureau of Reclamation report referenced herein), controllers and currently available ET methods are difficult to understand and implement. A number of references, patents, and published applications are in existence that cover ET-based methods and apparatus. At the Feb. 17, 2004, EPA-sponsored “Water Efficient Product Market Enhancement Program” in Phoenix, Ariz., for landscaping irrigation systems and controllers, it was projected that thirty-six states will have severe water shortages by the year 2010. This projected shortage has proven to be relatively accurate as of the date of this application. A significant portion of this projected shortage was attributed to user neglect and system inefficiency in landscape irrigation. The California Urban Water Conservation Council estimated that the average California household utilized one-half acre foot of water (162,500 gallons) annually, and that fifty-five percent (89,375 gallons) of this amount was used for landscape irrigation. It further estimated that approximately one-third of the irrigation water was wasted, either due to inefficient irrigation systems or inadequate controller programming, oftentimes due in part to complicated controller programming procedures required of the operator. This results in a total annual waste of 1.81 maf of water for California households alone. Excessive water usages in municipal and commercial areas, golf courses and schools further contribute to the water shortage. Such water shortages have forced many municipalities to enact strict water conservation measures. Two such measures include strongly encouraging the use of irrigation controllers that can adjust themselves to changing weather conditions, or instituting limitations of allowed watering days, or watering times during the day (sometimes referred to as Time-Of Use or “TOU” restrictions) both to minimize evaporation and during peak demand, which may vary during the various seasons. Some communities have also required the installation of water meters and “water police” auditors to enforce those schedules. Commercial and environmental users have enacted similar measures. For its part, the agricultural industry has responded to this shortage by resorting to drip, micro, and other low volume irrigation systems. However, after at least six years, there is still no consensus among consumers, water agencies, manufacturers, or state or federal government entities as to the most effective water conservation method or automated controls. For example, the California Energy Commission has suspended its proceedings for recommending labeling and sales standards; the California Department of Water Resources is not prepared to make recommendations concerning implementation of California Assembly Bill 1881 which would have required all irrigation controllers sold in California by January 2012 to be “smart.” Virtually all current weather based irrigation controllers and systems still utilize meteorological data to estimate the evapotranspiration, or ET, for a particular location. ET is generally used to determine the landscape watering needs by requiring input data consisting of crop coefficient factors, soil type, precipitation rates, degree of shade, and slope. This information is generally used to determine the initial controller irrigation schedule. In some applications, daily or periodic ET based calculations convert (typically) daily ET data to adjusted station run times or watering schedules. Some of these ET types of controllers and add-on modules are manufactured by Weathermatic, Rain Master, ET Water Systems, Hydro Point, Rain Bird, Hunter, Irritrol, and Toro, among others. All smart controllers, devices, and soil moisture sensors currently available are reviewed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, available from the Southern California Area Office, in their updated September 2009 “Weather and Soil Moisture Based Landscape Irrigation Scheduling Devices”. The use and efficiency factors of ET based smart controllers is still in doubt. A recent large study of 3112 ET based controllers installed throughout California conducted by AquaCraft revealed a disappointing 6% water savings. In addition, much fewer than 1% conversion to smart controllers has been accomplished after seven years throughout the U.S., and of those, about half were either not programmed correctly due to ET complexity, or not used in their smart mode within the first year of installation, partially due to monthly ET data service fees. Furthermore, there is significant disagreement with regard to the EPA's WaterSense labeling proposals by the Irrigation industry. Finally, the EPA estimated in a document accompanying its WaterSense labeling first draft specification in December 2009 that the return on investment (ROI) for using an ET based controller was 15 years-a very long ROI which does not encourage conversion. These continuing uncertainties and inefficiencies, along with cost, complexity, and the current state of the economy (which has deteriorated significantly since 2006) continue to slow efforts to convert to smart controller technology. Therefore, the industry is still seeking a simpler, more cost and a real water conservation effective solution. No matter how much water is theoretically saved by ET systems, the reality is that very little real water savings has been recorded to date using the currently available ET based and soil moisture sensing methods, even after the past six years of public education and municipal rebates. It is better to save real water than hypothetically saved water presented by most currently available ET based theories and methods which have been dominant to date. Other than system inefficiencies, the main reason for landscape water waste was revealed in a marketing study conducted by the Irrigation Association (IA) and presented at the 2003 IA “Smart Water Application Technology” conference in San Diego, Calif. The study indicated that most consumers typically adjust their irrigation schedule only an average of three times a year, rather than on a daily or weekly basis, regardless of changes in environmental conditions. The relatively high cost of labor in many municipalities further prohibits frequent manual adjustments of irrigation controllers in the commercial and municipal markets. This generally results in over-irrigation and runoff, particularly during the off-seasons, oftentimes by as much as one to two hundred percent. As an alternative to ET, soil moisture sensing devices and other methods of water conservation have been available for decades, but have enjoyed only limited success. Such devices and methods generally call for inserting moisture sensors into the soil to measure the soil moisture content. Newer soil moisture sensing technologies have more recently been developed, and claim to be theoretically accurate in measuring plant water needs. Such devices and methods are often problematic due to the location and number of sensors necessary to obtain accurate soil moisture readings, the high costs of installing and maintaining the sensors, and the integrity and reliability of the sensors' data. Nevertheless, soil moisture sensing devices and some simplified aspects of ET can be used in some embodiments of the present invention. For about twenty years, most irrigation controllers have had a feature called the “seasonal adjust” feature. Typically the controller is programmed with the irrigation schedule and station run times appropriate to its installation time of the year and suitable for the type of landscape vegetation and soil type. As the seasons change or it gets cooler or warmer, the seasonal adjust feature allows the user to manually change the baseline station run times set at the time of initial installation. This is a convenience feature that allows for the changing of all station run times on the controller or stations assigned on a particular program at one time. While this feature has been commonly available, the homeowners or landscape maintenance personnel only use this feature an average of 3 times a year. In between each adjustment is where most of the landscape water is wasted. Smart watering methods and apparatus are needed to automate features such as this to be more effective for water conservation. There are two primary ways to incorporate smart water technology using irrigation controllers. The first is to have it designed directly into the controller with software and features which require input from environmental sensors such as temperature, wind, relative humidity, or solar radiation or combinations thereof. The alternative is to have an add-on or a plug-in that is attached to the controller to adjust its irrigation schedule or watering durations. While add-ons and plug-ins are both generally separate from an existing controller, a distinction is made between the two. An add-on works with any brand of controller, normally installed in series on a common line to the valves, and may, for example, break the common line (shutting off the valves) under certain conditions. Many simple rain switches and soil moisture sensors are add-ons because they are installed on and break the common line, and when excessive precipitation or ground moisture is detected. A plug-in, on the other hand, literally plugs into only certain brands or models of controllers, and therefore requires compatibility with the controller. The Hunter Solar Sync and ET system and the Irritrol Climate Logic are examples of plug-ins, along with more sophisticated rain switches, moisture sensors, and weather stations. ET, or evapotranspiration, is the theoretical calculation of the amount of water needed by plants to replace water lost through plant absorption and evaporation, and is expressed in inches or millimeters of water per day. The United States Food and Agriculture Office (USFAO), in its Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 24, entitled “Crop Water Requirements,” noted that “a large number of more or less empirical methods have been developed over the last fifty years by numerous scientists and specialists worldwide to estimate ET from different climatic variables.” There are at least 15 different ET formulas. Each of these formulas provides a different result for the reference ET (ETo). In their paper entitled “Methods to Calculate Evapotranspiration: Differences and Choices,” Diego Cattaneo and Luke Upham published a four-year comparison of four different ETo formulas—the Penman-Monteith formula, the Schwab formula, the Penman formula, and the Penman program. Using the same four year data but different weather parameters and ET algorithms, the four theoretical ET calculations show results that vary by as much as seventy-percent (See FIG. 8 ) during certain times of the year. Irrespective of these variations, a modified version of the Penman-Monteith formula (which varies the most from the other three equations) is still recognized as the “standard” by both the USFAO and California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS). Variances of less than twenty percent from this ET are considered acceptable, particularly as an irrigation deficit. In its first draft specification the EPA dated December 2009, the EPA proposed that up to a 20% deficit was not only acceptable, but in many cases was desirable during SWAT testing for the purposes of WaterSense labeling. It is now generally accepted that the Pennman-Monteith calculation provides 20% more irrigation than required. The Penman-Monteith formula is as follows: The variables within this formula represent the following: ETo=grass reference evapotranspiration in millimeters per day. Δ=slope of saturation vapor pressure curve kPa° C. at the mean air temperature. Rn=net radiation (MJm −2 h −1 ). G=soil heat flux density (MJm −2 h −1 ). Y=psychometric constant (kPa° C.). Ta=mean hourly air temperature (° C.). U2=wind speed at two meters (m s −1 ). Es=saturation vapor pressure (kPa) at the mean hourly air temperature Ea=actual vapor pressure (kPa) at the mean hourly air temperature in ° C. λ=latent heat of vaporization (MJkg −1 ). Cd=bulk surface resistance and aerodynamics resistance coefficient. The simplest ET formula is the Hargreaves formula proposed by the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Its equation is described in the College's Fact Sheet Engineer's Notebook No. 106, published May 1997, in an article entitled “[a] Simple Evapotranspiration Model for Hawaii,” as follows: ETo= 0.0135( T+ 17.18) Rs The variables within this formula represent the following: ETo=potential daily evapotranspiration in mm/day. T=mean daily temperature (° C.). Rs=incident solar radiation converted to millimeters of water per day (MJ). This formula relies upon the same ET theories and interrelationships as the other formulas disclosed above. As described herein, such reliance causes the Hargreaves formula to possess the same shortcomings as the other ET formulas. In view of the significant discrepancies between various ET equations, as noted, the question is, which, if any, of these equations is the most accurate ET, or are they all merely theoretical estimations? The inventions described herein are not so much theoretical as practical and user-friendly alternative approaches to water conservation with greater potential to save real rather than theoretical water. In an October 2005 Assembly bill 2717 task force meeting in Sacramento, Calif., the state Department of Water Resources (DWR) was asked for their definition of “Smart” controllers. The DWR described “Smart” in the same manner as the Irrigation Association, the Center for Irrigation Technology, and the EPA, in that a smart controller is capable of adjusting itself daily based upon the time of the year and the current environmental conditions and that smart technology is not limited to ET controllers. A number of irrigation controller manufacturers currently offer ET based controllers as noted in the Bureau of Water Reclamation report. Several of them obtain the environmental data to calculate ET from historical records, while others utilize adjacently located weather stations to obtain real-time data. Others receive such information from a network of existing weather stations by radio, satellite or pager means for a monthly fee. The Irrigation Association announced at their November 2005 conference SWAT meeting in Phoenix, Ariz. that the Center for Irrigation Technology (CIT) is continuing to test all climatologically based water saving systems to include ET, ground moisture sensing, and other types of smart technology. As of October 2010, CIT is still conducting SWAT testing on climate based controllers, add-ons, and plug-ins. The EPA is in the process of establishing additional testing laboratories who will use the SWAT test protocol as the basis for their evaluation of smart controllers, rain switches, soil moisture sensors, add-ons and plug-ins, in addition to other water saving devices. Just recently, at the Smart Water Conference meeting with the EPA, it was announced that the EPA standards are proposed to be incorporated with the International Code Council standards. The following U.S. patents all disclose various methods by which an irrigation controller calculates or adjusts an irrigation schedule based upon historical, distal, or local ETo: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,962,522; 5,097,861; 5,208,855; 5,479,339; 5,696,671; 6,298,285 and 6,314,340. All of these methods calculate ETo values or receive them from external sources, and use such values to adjust and regulate irrigation. Such external sources may be CIMIS ET databases, local sensors, cable lines or broadcast stations. Several of these methods also utilize other data, such as precipitation. While the replacement of the water in the vegetation root zone by means of theoretically calculated ET has been of academic interest for over fifty years, methods incorporating ET formulas, and the installation, comprehension and programming of controllers utilizing such methods, including those cited in the referenced patents above, are generally far too complex for the average user to understand and implement. Such a conclusion was reached in an earlier study of ET controllers by the Irvine Ranch Water District, entitled “Residential Weather Based Irrigation Scheduling Study.” The study stated the following: “The water agency solution to date has been to conduct residential audits, leaving the homeowner with a suggested watering schedule, hoping it would then be followed. These programs have had limited effect and a short-term impact. A preferred solution would be to install irrigation controllers that automatically adjust watering times based on local weather conditions. Unfortunately, until now, these large landscape control systems have been far too complex and expensive for residential applications.” Such complexity is underscored by the one hundred forty-five principal symbols and acronyms identified by the USFAO for use and description of the factors and variables related to ET theory and its various formulas, covering such variables as: the capillary rise; the resistance correction factor; the soil heat capacity; the psychrometer coefficient; and the bulk stomatal resistance of a well-illuminated leaf. The sheer number of variables renders ET theory difficult to explain, understand and apply, especially for an unsophisticated consumer with little or no scientific or meteorological background. For example, the manual for one ET-based controller currently on the market comprises over one hundred fifty pages of instructions and explanations. Such unfamiliarity and complexity increase the margins of error already associated with the various ET formulas, further diminishing their effectiveness. Water districts, irrigation consultants, manufacturers, the Irrigation Association, the Center for Irrigation Technology and other attendees at the EPA's Water Efficient Product Market Enhancement Program estimated that, due to the complexity, cost, impracticality of installation and difficulty in programming current irrigation controllers, less than one percent of all commercial and residential landscape irrigation systems currently and effectively utilize some form of the ET or moisture sensing method. While manufacturers, water districts, and irrigation consultants have accepted the concept of smart controllers as a means of landscape water conservation, homeowners (the users) have still not embraced this technology after seven years of education and encouragement with rebates. To further emphasize this lack of acceptance, after six years of public education and encouragement with rebates and water rate increases, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District (that serves 3.5 million households) recently reported a total conversion of 90,000 systems to ET based controllers either provided free of charge or heavily rebated (2.6%). In another large water district, the Southern Nevada Water Authority that serves Clark County, Nevada reported in 2009 that after a three year period of 50% rebates, fewer than 100 such “smart” based controllers have been rebated. Such paltry adoption exists despite over fifty years of ET research, and over thirty years of ground moisture sensing technology. In 2006, about 1.2 million new conventional (non smart) controllers were installed or replaced in the U.S. Since the recession, this number has declined to about 700,000 controllers a year. The EPA has estimated that there currently are 13.5 million existing non smart controllers in residential use. In view of the extremely slow conversion to new ET based controllers, it would be far more effective in terms of real water conservation versus theoretical water conservation to address the 13.5 million existing controllers to make them more water efficient. Even if the ET or ground moisture sensing methods provided one hundred percent efficiency, which they do not, the limited adoption of these methods renders them an ineffective means of significant water conservation, since less than one percent of the water waste would be prevented. A second shortcoming of the ET method is its dependence upon numerous categories of local, real-time meteorological data. As indicated above, many variables must be measured in order to calculate ET. Data for each variable must be obtained by separate sensors, each one installed in a particular location. Such particularity requires an understanding of local environmental conditions and meteorology. Furthermore, accuracy requires that the data be received from local sensors. Given the numerous microclimates existing within any one geographical area, data received from remotely located sensors may be inaccurate. The data must also be received and processed in real-time, since average or historical ET data may be inaccurate during periods of unusual or excessive heat, cold, or rain, or other deviations from historical climate patterns. Any inaccurate data would result in even greater ET deviations and inefficient irrigation. However, general trends may still be identified, even with inaccurate ET data. These general trends may be used to create the bell curves (or portions thereof) utilized in embodiments of the present invention. ET measuring devices are generally also expensive to install and maintain. Sensors or weather stations must be placed within each microclimate to measure the different variables utilized by the formula of choice. Each weather station may cost up to several thousand dollars. Furthermore, all of these sensors or stations must undergo regular inspection, maintenance and calibration to insure that they continue to provide accurate data. This further increases the actual cost of each station. The sensors and stations must also be powered in some manner—depending upon the particular geographic location, AC power may not be readily available. All of these considerations increase the cost of implementing an ET-based irrigation system to a prohibitive level, and limit the widespread adoption of this method. Finally, all of this assumes that the weather station or sensors is even installable in a particular area. Some areas, such as street medians or parks, are not suitable for weather station or sensor installation due to aesthetic reasons or the likelihood of vandalism. Another shortcoming of ET-based controllers is that all of the ETo formulas (including the Hargreaves formula) are generally expressed in hundredths of an inch, or millimeters, of water per day. Thus, ETo must be converted to an actual irrigation time of minutes. Such a conversion is dependent upon the characteristics of the particular hydraulic system, such as the valve sizes, water flow rates, and sprinkler or drip irrigation precipitation rates. One conversion formula, proposed by the Austin (Texas) Lawn Sprinkler Association, calculates the sprinkler run time in minutes (T) as follows: The variables within this equation represent the following: ETo=reference evapotranspiration rate, in inches. Kc=the percentage crop coefficient. Pr=the sprinkler precipitation rate, in inches per hour. Ea=the percentage application efficiency of the hydraulics system. As an example of such complexity, the crop coefficient (Kc) is different for each crop or landscape plant or grass type. Determining the precipitation rate (Pr) requires knowledge of the hydraulic system specifications—the particular types of valves and sprinklers, the number of valves and sprinklers within the system, the water flow rate and operating pressure and an actual measurement of each type of water delivery sprinkler, bubbler, or dripper. Such information is not readily available to the average consumer. Instead, the consumer must expend additional time and money to retain an irrigation expert to configure and install the system. Another ET-to-irrigation-time conversion method, the ‘deficit irrigation practice,’ was proposed by the IA Water Management Committee in Appendix G of its October 2002 article entitled “Turf and Landscape Irrigation Best Management Practices.” This conversion method comprised ten separate formulas, and utilized a total of twenty-nine variables and constants, not including those utilized in calculating the ET value. Many of these variables represented concepts and relationships difficult for the average irrigation designer, much less a consumer, to understand, such as: the local landscape coefficient for the particular vegetation; available water depending upon the particular soil composition; allowable water depletion rate from the root zone; maximum percentage allowable depletion without plant stress; the water management factor necessary to overcome water management inefficiency; the whole day stress-based irrigation interval; water flow rates for the particular system; and, of course, ET. Due to the urgency arising from severe national drought and environmental conditions, and the shortcomings of the various present technologies, the irrigation industry is still researching alternative methods for water conservation and prevention of unintended runoff. The Center for Irrigation Technology in Fresno, Calif., recently renamed as the Irrigation Center for Water Technology (ICWT) along with other educational and research institutions and water conservation agencies, is conducting studies evaluating various water conservation methods. On the national level, the EPA has introduced its “WaterSense” irrigation efficiency rating program similar to the “EnergyStar” rating system currently in use for equipment energy efficiency. The purpose of such an irrigation efficiency rating program is to promote consumer awareness, compliance, and standardization as an alternative to nationally and regionally mandated water conservation measures which would severely and negatively impact the irrigation industry, landscape aesthetics and the ecology. As a result, the EPA WaterSense program introduced its first draft specification for irrigation controller labeling in December of 2009. The second draft is expected in December 2010. It is clear from the foregoing discussion that since 2003 the irrigation water management industry, in view of a politically and economically sensitive, and urgent, water crisis, is still pursuing highly scientific, mathematical and/or theoretical approaches for resolving the problems of wasted irrigation water and drought conditions. Unsurprisingly, such approaches have met with limited success. The EPA, United States Department of Energy (DOE), Bureau of Reclamation, ecologists, environmentalists, municipalities, water agencies, research institutions, irrigation consultants, and manufacturers, and now the International Code Council are all still searching for new methods that provide practical (as opposed to theoretical) improved irrigation efficiency—methods that overcome the particular shortcomings of existing systems. California Bill 1881 states the following in Article 10.8, section 25401.9(c) under “ Water Conservation in Landscaping ” as follows: “On and after Jan. 1, 2012, an irrigation controller or moisture sensor for landscape irrigation uses may not be sold or installed in the state unless the controller or sensor meets the performance standards and labeling requirements established pursuant to this section.” No such standards are available to date, nor is there any projected date since the California Energy Commission has suspended its mission after three public meetings and input from irrigation professionals, manufacturers, water districts, and irrigation consultants. Therefore, the implementation of 1881 will most likely be delayed and standards not published in the near future due to the suspension of the California Energy Commission meetings due to disagreements within the industry and fiscal reasons. It is believed that several embodiments of the present invention will meet the anticipated performance standards and would therefore qualify for sale in California. Landscape water conservation, when it is substantial and effective, also provides additional benefits. As noted by the EPA in its “Water Efficient Landscaping” guidelines, landscape water conservation also results in “decreased energy use (and air pollution associated with its generation) because less pumping and treatment of water is required and reduced runoff of storm water and irrigation water that carries top soils, fertilizers, and pesticides into lakes, rivers, and streams, fewer yard trimmings, reduced landscaping labor and maintenance costs, and extended life for water resources infrastructures (e.g. reservoirs, treatment plants, groundwater aquifers), thus reduced taxpayer costs.” Thus, there is an urgent need for irrigation systems that conserve water and energy, and minimize negative impact upon the environment, by automatically adjusting their schedules periodically in response to meteorological and seasonal changes. The problem of irrigation mismanagement, and the main hurdle faced by these entities, can be simply summarized as follows: once a system is properly designed and installed, most of the wasted landscape irrigation water and runoff is caused by not adjusting for daily, periodic, or seasonal changes. For example, in California, most homeowners and municipalities continue to irrigate their system in the fall based upon the summer schedule until the first rain storm of the year occurs followed by a sharp drop in temperature. If the summer schedule is assumed to be 100%, and November irrigation actually only requires, for example, about 20% of summer irrigation to satisfy the vegetation needs, this means that as much as 80% of the water is wasted in the fall. Such inaction is usually caused by the complexity and difficulty of determining the particular adjustment amounts and the significant inconvenience of daily adjustments. As an alternative to costly and impractical to install weather stations, some manufacturers are offering an ET service that broadcasts the daily ET signal by means of a satellite or pager system. An example of this approach is the AccuWater system which takes weather data collected through a private network of weather stations and or sensors. Another example is the HydroPoint Weather TRAK that requires every controller to have a receiver that either receives ET that affects the controller irrigation programming, or one that receives separate weather sensor data that is then calculated locally into an ET value (such as provided by Irrisoft with its Weather Reach Receiver and the RainBird ET Manager). As discussed in provisional patent applications 60/831,904 and 60/899,200 (which have been incorporated above), many communities also have water pumping and delivery issues due to drought and increasing population and demand on the infrastructure delivering that water. Many of those communities have enacted limitations on watering schedules in order to minimize the demand on those facilities. The most common water restriction method has been to limit watering to odd and even days of the month, meaning that odd numbered addresses can water on the odd day of the month, while even numbered addresses can water on even days of the month. During certain times of the year, the homeowner must also manually change the allowed time of the day that he can water. By limiting landscape irrigation to certain times of the day and by either even or street address designations, or by watering groups such as designated by the SNWA (Southern Nevada Water Authority) as shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B . In the case of SNWA, the region is divided into six watering groups, designated as A-F. Watering is allowed every day during the summer for every group, but not between the hours of 11 AM and 7 PM to minimize evaporation and high peak demand periods. During the spring and fall, irrigation is permitted any time of day, but only three times a week depending upon the assigned watering group. In the winter, only one watering day per week is permitted. Fines are issued for multiple offenders. However, this method is difficult to police because there are 500,000 customers in Clark County, Nevada, so many users commonly violate these rules. It is inconvenient for the homeowner, for example, to remember to change the watering schedule and comply with the allowed watering times of the day at least 4 times a year, particularly if they are not familiar with the programming of the controller. The SNWA estimates that after 5 years of public education and rules “enforcement”, has resulted in 30% estimated compliance. While there is still a long way to go, this is far better in terms of saving real water and easing infrastructure demands than rebated ET based controllers or ground moisture sensors have shown to date. With ET related complexities and frequent disregard for watering time of use rules, a simple, intuitive solution would be highly preferred over the existing highly theoretical and technical, but impractical, state of the art ET-based and ground moisture sensing control systems and dependence upon human manual compliance with restricted watering schedules. Furthermore, according to the EPA support statement of December 2009 accompanying their first draft WaterSense Specification, there are thirteen and a half million existing residential controllers in current use nationally. While ET based controllers address newly installed systems, existing non smart controllers, including battery powered controllers have not been addressed. Since it will most likely take a decade to replace all existing controllers with smart controllers, some simple inexpensive methods are needed to save water in the interim, because ET based methods and soil moisture sensors have not been effective in providing meaningful water conservation over the last decade since the use of ET was promoted within the irrigation industry and state and federal government agencies The relatively low cost of water, the ET based controller's initial high cost and complexity, and monthly service fees have contributed to the very low usage of ET based controllers, add-ons, plug ins. It is therefore desirable to provide simple, user-intuitive and readily acceptable landscape water conservation methods and devices. It is desirable that these methods and devices have a minimum of environmental sensor inputs, and a minimum of additional controller programming to implement smart water technology so as to not require professional installation or water audits. It is also desirable that these methods not require monthly ET based service fees It is also desirable that these methods and apparatus can be implemented within the controller, or through an add-on or plug-in device to address the 13.5 million existing irrigation controllers in the U.S. (according to the EPA WaterSense draft specification of December 2009). It is also desirable that these methods and apparatus be reasonably retail priced so as to not depend upon rebates for their acceptance. It is also desirable that automation be provided within controllers, add-ons or plug-ins for watering restrictions alone or in combination with smart controllers, plug-ins or add-ons. It is also desirable to automate water budgeting by providing simple, user-intuitive, and readily acceptable water conservation approaches, and clearly understood automated methods and apparatus for calculating and/or implementing adjustments to irrigation schedules. It is further desirable to provide methods and apparatus that automate the “seasonal adjust” function of irrigation controllers either internally to a controller, or using add-ons or plug-ins. It is preferable, but not necessary, to utilize temperature budgeting, air or ground moisture sensing, or even historical ET in automating water budgeting. It is further desirable to provide methods and apparatus that minimize the margins and sources of errors by minimizing the number of sensor inputs required by the variables in the formulas. It is further desirable to provide methods and apparatus that utilize minimal local, real-time meteorological data that is not necessarily ET based. It is further desirable that such methods and apparatus be cost-efficient, affordable, installable, and usable by a large number of people and entities within the irrigation industry with the widest range of applications possible. It is further desirable that such methods and apparatus be understandable by the average consumer. It is further desirable that such methods and apparatus be accomplished automatically, without requiring regular manual adjustments by the operator of the irrigation watering time settings or schedules. It is also desirable that temperature budgeting be adaptable to time of use restrictions established by various communities or water agencies. It is also highly desirable to provide very simple methods and apparatus for water conservation for existing AC and DC powered controllers for faster implementation of landscape water conservation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, the pending parent application Ser. No. 11/879,700, the grandparent U.S. Pat. No. 7,266,428, the great-grandparent U.S. Pat. No. 7,058,478, and U.S. Provisional application 60/465,457 filed Apr. 25, 2003, address the above desires and provide numerous automated methods of landscape water conservation by automating the seasonal “water budget” or “seasonal adjust” feature available in many irrigation controllers. Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and apparatus by which temperature budgeting, as a preferred embodiment, or ET, or soil moisture or other embodiments, can be utilized to automate the “water budget” or “seasonal adjust” feature, in order to automatically alter irrigation watering schedules, station run times and/or watering intervals easily and effectively. The invention of this and previous patents is automation of the “water budget” or “seasonal adjustment” feature. Temperature budgeting is merely a preferred method of accomplishing that goal. Historical ET or ground moisture may be used to accomplish this goal. As shown by examples below, no complicated ET calculations, transmitted ET data, or programming is required to accomplish water conservation with the present methods and apparatus. More particularly, numerous automated methods, apparatus and systems for water conservation and management are disclosed herein and in the above predecessor patents, embodiments which automate the manual “seasonal adjust” or water budget feature available in many irrigation controllers. Embodiments of the invention are independent of expensive weather stations, evapotranspiration (ET or ETo calculations), or complicated formulas for calculating irrigation durations or sprinkler operating times based strictly upon ETo. The preferred embodiments utilize periodic environmental data that may be incorporated into calculated water budget percentage (WBP) bell shaped curves or portions thereof. The water budget percentages may be pre-programmed into controllers, add-on modules or plug-in modules, and which may be used independently of, or optionally with current environmental sensors. Embodiments of the invention may incorporate one or more of the following features: 1. An optional precipitation sensor may be used to interrupt, delay or prohibit irrigation cycles. 2. An optional temperature sensor may be used to shut down or prohibit irrigation in case of cold temperatures. A temperature sensor can also adjust irrigation run times or alter watering intervals when the high temperature exceeds the historical averages for certain locations. 3. An optional soil moisture or other sensor may be also be used in much the same way as a precipitation or temperature sensor. 4. Zip code entry can determine a specific location or geographic region. 5. Application of the water budget feature is automatic. 6. Physical embodiments may be provided within the controller, as add-ons, or as plug-ins 7. Water budget percent (WBP) may be broadcast wirelessly from a central location. 8. Irrigation controller or add-on or central broadcasting modules may be powered by AC, DC, ambient light, battery or otherwise. 9. In some applications, embodiments of the invention may be an add-on to an existing battery (non AC) powered controller using a back biased output diode. Embodiments of the non smart versions of the present invention may incorporate one or more “bell” curves, or portions thereof, that include a set of percentages plotted over time that are applicable to particular geographical areas. In most cases, a full bell curve ordinarily covers an entire year. These bell curves are derived using historical, climatic, geographic and/or environmental information for a particular locality and preferably cover an annual time frame. An exemplary annual bell curve for California is shown in FIG. 1 and compared to an ET curve for California using CIMIS ET data. It is to be appreciated that the calculated water budget percentages (WBP) sometimes closely approximate ET based percentage curves and calculations, as seen in FIG. 1 . In the WBP embodiments, a percentage may be provided, for example, for each day of the year, and that percentage is used each day to deviate from an otherwise standard daily watering schedule. It is to be appreciated that in various embodiments, different sets of water budget percentages (e.g., different portions of a bell curve) may be provided over different time frames (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annually, bi-annually, etc.). It is also to be appreciated that a set of water budget percentages for one locality may not necessarily be appropriate for use at another locality. Hence multiple selectable water budget percentage curves would be desirable. In some embodiments, the temperature budgeting algorithm described in more detail elsewhere herein may be used to derive the water budget percentages found in annual bell curves (or portions thereof) which very closely approximate ET bell curves (see FIGS. 1 and 1A ) or portions thereof (e.g., daily or periodic water budget percentages). These WBP's may be derived, for example, from analytical studies at various locations throughout a geographical region representing all types of weather conditions. Embodiments of regional bell curves are time-of-year dependent and generally represent an estimated average of watering needs for plants which approximate evapotranspiration needs. In some embodiments, an add-on module may be provided with data input consisting of location (zip code, zone, weather region, etc.). This may be accomplished by directly entering the zip code, for example, into the module microprocessor, or by plugging the module outfitted with a USB port, or similar data input mechanism, into an existing personal computer. Once the location is known, data for that location such as latitude, periodic (daily, weekly, or monthly) RA factors, and periodic average high temperatures for that location is used to calculate the periodic water budget percentages curve (WBP) for that location. Once the daily percentages are determined from the curve (similar to those shown in FIG. 1A ), the station watering times or watering intervals are calculated within the module. The module can then adjust the run times or watering intervals externally from the existing controller by, for example, breaking the common line. Alternately, a controller may be designed or modified to accept the WBP data from a PC with the use of a memory stick or the like, or by other wired or wireless means. If a plug-in module is used, the WBP data may be provided to the controller through the plug-in module, which itself may receive the data by any of the above means. The controller then alters its watering run times or intervals based upon the WBP provided. In other embodiments, the controller may further adjust its watering schedule or station run times according to the WBP data using local watering restrictions, which may also be downloaded by any of the above means. Such controllers can be augmented with additional environmental sensors such as a rain switch or sensor, temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, or other sensor, or combinations of sensors, to modify implementation of the WBP. In highly simplified embodiments, add-on modules may be provided that are pre-programmed with the date, time and one or more WBP bell curves (or portions thereof) for a particular geographic location. The programming may be accomplished when a module is made, or a module may have an input port for downloading the WBP data for a selected geographic location where the module is to be used, together with the current date and time (if not already provided). The modules of these embodiments are preferably battery powered, and have an electrical input and output connection so that they may be connected, for example, on a common line between a controller and its valves to break that common line when appropriate. These modules may be encapsulated (potted) to protect them from exterior environmental conditions. The simple modules of these embodiments include internal clocks and contain programming to accumulate periodic (e.g. daily) water budget percentages (WBP) from the pre-programmed bell curves. When the accumulated WBPs reach or exceed a given threshold level (e.g. 100%), the modules close the connection allowing current to flow through the line for a given interval (e.g. 24 hours). When the interval is over, the connection is broken, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again. In preferred embodiments, it is desirable that the controller be set to water a full summer cycle every day. The modules of these embodiments will prevent such watering until the threshold is reached, and on that day the controller can perform full watering. It is to be appreciated that modules of these embodiments may be placed on any line leading to or from a valve in order to control that valve; and that multiple modules may be used to control multiple valves. In some embodiments, a display may be provided on such modules showing one or more of the following: current date, current time, whether watering is currently being allowed or not, accumulation toward threshold, etc. In some embodiments a reset input/switch (to reset the accumulation) and/or a manual override input (e.g. switch) may also be provided. In slightly more sophisticated embodiments of the pre-programmed modules of the present invention, local watering restrictions may also be loaded into a module, along with the WBPs for a geographic location, and the current date and time. This additional data is used by the module and its internal clock to prevent watering during restricted days and/or times of day. Thus, the accumulated WBPs may reach or exceed the established threshold on a day or at a time when watering is prohibited according to the known local watering restrictions. In such cases, programming in the modules of these embodiments will delay closing the line (completing the circuit to allow watering to occur) until a day/time when watering is permitted according to the local watering restrictions. After watering is allowed to occur, the connection is then broken, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again. Accumulation of WBPs may or may not continue during the delay, depending on the desires of the user. Embodiments of these modules may also have a display, reset and/or override functions. In more sophisticated embodiments of the pre-programmed modules of the present invention, at least one environmental sensor may be provided, with or without the local watering restrictions, along with the WBPs for a geographic location, and the current date and time. Input from the environmental sensor is used by the module, along with the watering restrictions if provided, to prevent watering under certain environmental conditions and/or during restricted days and/or times of day. Thus, the accumulated WBPs may reach or exceed the established threshold on a day or at a time when an environmental sensor indicates that there is a condition where watering should not occur (e.g., there has been recent precipitation, the temperature is below freezing, etc.). Programming and internal clocks in the modules of these embodiments will cause watering to be delayed until the environmental condition has changed. If local watering restrictions are also available, watering will be prevented until both (a) the environmental condition has changed/passed, and (b) it is an allowed watering day/time. After watering is allowed to occur, the connection is then broken, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again at which time the environmental sensor(s), and local watering restrictions if present, are again consulted before watering is allowed to occur. Accumulation of WBPs may or may not continue during the delay, depending on the desires of the user. Embodiments of these modules may also have a display (including current environmental input), reset and/or override functions. In advanced embodiments of the modules of the present invention, a plurality of inputs are provided on such modules, corresponding to the plurality of valve output control lines from the controller. Some of these embodiments may be referred to as “plug ins.” A module is attached between the controller and these lines to the valves, and the common line. In these embodiments, the module “learns” the irrigation schedule by monitoring the voltage or current on each line used to control each individual valve. The module is programmed with the WBP for the given geographic location, along with the date and time, and optionally any restricted watering schedules and/or one or more environmental sensors. However, instead of accumulating WBPs until a threshold is reached, the daily WBP is used to modify the daily irrigation schedule from the controller. By way of example and without limitation to the appended claims, a controller may be programmed to water 4 valves for 12 minutes each. A module of these embodiments learns this schedule, and then applies the current day's WBP to that schedule. So, for example, if the WBP for the day is 75%, then the module will cut off each valve after 9 minutes of operation. Of course, if optional environmental sensors and/or restricted watering schedules are provided, the module will also prevent watering during those times. Embodiments of these modules may also have a display, reset and/or override functions. In other embodiments, simple controllers may be provided that that are pre-programmed with the date, time and one or more WBP bell curves (or portions thereof) for a particular geographic location. The programming may be accomplished when the controller is made, or a controller may have an input port for downloading the WBP data for a selected geographic location where the controller is to be used, together with the current date and time (if not already provided). The controllers of these embodiments contain programming to accumulate periodic (e.g. daily) water budget percentages (WBP) from the pre-programmed bell curves. When the accumulated WBPs reach or exceed a given threshold level (e.g. 100%), the controller is allowed to operate its valves for a given interval (e.g. 24 hours). When the interval is over, operation of the valves is prevented, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again. In preferred embodiments, it is desirable that the controller be set to water a full summer cycle every day. The programming of these embodiments will prevent such watering until the threshold is reached, and on that day the controller can perform full watering. Embodiments of these controllers may also have a display, reset and/or override functions. In slightly more sophisticated embodiments of the pre-programmed controllers of the present invention, local watering restrictions may also be loaded into a controller, along with the WBPs for a geographic location, and the current date and time. This additional data is used by the controller to prevent watering during restricted days and/or times of day. Thus, the accumulated WBPs may reach or exceed the established threshold on a day or at a time when watering is prohibited according to the known local watering restrictions. In such cases, programming in the controllers of these embodiments will delay watering until a day/time when watering is permitted according to the local watering restrictions. After watering is allowed to occur, watering is again prevented, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again. Accumulation of WBPs may or may not continue during the delay, depending on the desires of the user. Embodiments of these controllers may also have a display, reset and/or override functions. In more sophisticated embodiments of pre-programmed controllers of the present invention, at least one environmental sensor may be provided, with or without the local watering restrictions, along with the WBPs for a geographic location, and the current date and time. Input from the environmental sensor is used by the controller, along with the watering restrictions if provided, to prevent watering under certain environmental conditions and/or during restricted days and/or times of day. Thus, the accumulated WBPs may reach or exceed the established threshold on a day or at a time when an environmental sensor indicates that there is a condition where watering should not occur (e.g., there has been recent precipitation, the temperature is below freezing, etc.). Programming in the controllers of these embodiments will cause watering to be delayed until the environmental condition has changed. If local watering restrictions are also available, watering will be prevented until both (a) the environmental condition has changed/passed, and (b) it is an allowed watering day/time. After watering is allowed to occur, watering is again prevented, and accumulation of periodic WBPs starts over until the threshold is reached or exceeded again, at which time the environmental sensor(s), and local watering restrictions if present, are again consulted before watering is allowed to occur again. Accumulation of WBPs may or may not continue during the delay, depending on the desires of the user. Embodiments of these controllers may also have a display, reset and/or override functions. In some controller embodiments, instead of accumulating WBPs until a threshold is reached, the daily WBP is used to modify the daily irrigation schedule of controller. By way of example and without limitation to the appended claims, a controller may be programmed to water 4 valves for 12 minutes each. Then, for example, if the WBP for the day is 75%, then the controller will cut off each valve after 9 minutes of operation. Of course, if optional environmental sensors and/or restricted watering schedules are provided, the controller will also prevent watering during those times In some embodiments, a water budget percentage (WBP) bell curve may be developed, for example, by using soil moisture sensing data combined with specific location historical or baseline soil temperature and/or soil moisture information, and comparing it to current soil temperature and moisture data. The station run times or adjusted watering schedules may be determined directly from a bell curve such as those shown in FIG. 1A . Each region of the United States, or the world, for that matter, could have historical bell curves pre-programmed into the controller or add-on or plug-in device. In some embodiments, it is possible to obtain a water percentage bell curve using soil moisture sensing data combined with specific location historical or baseline soil temperature and soil moisture information and comparing it to current soil temperature and moisture data. As with temperature budgeting, in some of these embodiments the controller may be programmed with a baseline or summer irrigation schedule. In this case, the baseline schedule may be determined from the soil type, slope, and crop coefficient factors, as well as the sprinkler precipitation rate. The present invention is not particularly concerned with how the baseline schedule is determined, only that it can be adjusted on a periodic (preferably daily) basis after the baseline or summer schedule is determined using ET, soil data, experience, or readily available programming software such as that provided by Rain Bird on their web site. The WBP is expressed as a percentage, which is a ratio of numbers. Historical or baseline soil data compared to current similar data may provide a percentage similar to temperature budgeting. From the resulting percentages, or percentages interpolated from a bell curve for soil, the station run times or watering intervals can similarly be adjusted either in an external module which then supplies this information to the existing controller, or which may break the common line. Alternately, the data can be provided directly into the controller which then adjusts the irrigation based upon the daily or periodic percentage data or bell curve. As with the temperature methods, field sensor data can be provided by hard wired or wireless means to the external module or to the controller directly. A precipitation sensor can be added optionally to immediately interrupt irrigation. If an adequate rainfall amount is recorded, the soil moisture sensor will indicate that condition and interrupt or disable irrigation. The rain fall information may also be provided by wired or wireless means. Similarly, historical ET for a location may be provided for the month of July as the baseline month. Then a periodic ET is compared to the baseline ET and its ratio is expressed as a percentage with which the run times or watering intervals or schedules are adjusted. FIG. 1A shows several curves expressed as a percentage of the baseline (preferably summer) irrigation schedule. These ET based curves can then be stored into the controller, add-on, or plug-in microprocessor. One of these is then selected by entering a zip code or region as shown in FIG. 1A . While FIG. 1A shows temperature budgeting percentage curves, the analytical study in FIG. 1 at twenty five locations indicates close approximation to ET regardless of location. Another observation is that while wind and relative humidity may have a daily affect upon ET, that for landscape purposes over longer periods of time, these two environmental parameters tend to cancel each other out. During the course of a month, a certain number of windy days will tend to increase the need for irrigation, while certain days of higher humidity will tend to decrease the need for irrigation. Automation of the water budget feature is therefore similar whether the preferred temperature budgeting method is used, soil moisture, or ET based. The proposed inventive devices do not transmit or receive ET data, nor do they calculate ET from sensor data. Historical ET data may however be used for the purposes of establishing the summer or baseline peak irrigation percentage (typically 100%). Operationally, as with temperature budgeting, the controller is programmed with a baseline or summer irrigation schedule which may be determined, for example, from the soil type, slope, and/or crop coefficient factors, as well as the sprinkler or dripper precipitation rates. Rain Bird, for example, among others provides an irrigation schedule determination means over the internet. Certain landscape data is entered and a recommended schedule is developed from their web site. Alternate means of determining summer or baseline irrigation schedules come from personal experience, or other published landscape watering guidelines. The present invention is not concerned as to how the baseline irrigation schedule is determined, whether it is soil moisture sensor based, or climatologically, or ET based. Embodiments of the present invention automate or simulate the automation of the water budget or “seasonal adjust” feature. The water budget feature within a controller can be automated internally, provided by an external plug-in that provides the percentage data to the controller microprocessor, or adjusts the watering intervals or station run times by means of an external plug-in that is connected to either the controller common line or monitors the controller outputs. In embodiments of the invention, adjustment of a baseline schedule may be accomplished with either a cumulative or a (preferred) daily water budget adjustment after the baseline watering schedule is determined—so long as it can be automatically adjusted on a periodic (preferably daily) basis after a baseline (e.g. summer) schedule is determined. A water budget is expressed as a set of percentages, and embodiments of the present invention automate application of those percentages. The present invention starts after the baseline irrigation schedule is determined and uses a water budget percentage (WBP) bell curve for the location to adjust that schedule. The schedule may optionally be modified based on current environmental sensor data. Those sensors may include air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind, and rainfall, or combinations thereof. Then, based on the WBP and optional current environmental conditions, the station run times or watering intervals are adjusted accordingly. Historical or baseline soil data available from sources such as CIMIS may be used or compared to current similar data to provide percentages in a manner similar to temperature budgeting. From the resulting percentages, or percentages interpolated from soil moisture data, the station run times or watering intervals can similarly be adjusted. This may be accomplished in an external module which then supplies this information to the existing controller, or which breaks the common line; or, alternatively, the data can be provided directly into the controller which then adjusts the irrigation based upon the daily or periodic WBP data or bell curve. The field sensor data can be provided by hard wired or wireless means to the external module or controller. A precipitation sensor can be added optionally to immediately interrupt irrigation. If an adequate rainfall amount is recorded, the soil moisture sensor will indicate that condition and interrupt or disable irrigation. The rain fall information may also be provided by wired or wireless means. While temperature budgeting is preferred over soil moisture sensing and ET methods, because of the complications of using ET directly, and the simplicity of using water budget percentages, in some situations historical ET data may be used to develop water budgeting percentages of the present invention and avoid complicated programming of an ET-based controller, add-on or plug-in. For example, historical ET data may be used to develop WBP bell curves for daily or periodic water budget percentages. As stated previously, the present invention is not concerned with how the baseline or summer irrigation schedule is determined, only with its adjustment of that schedule after it is determined. Historical ET data is readily available from a number of government climatological sources such as CIMIS. While conventional ET methods are cumbersome, complicated, and expensive, it is still a widely recognized method of determining the baseline irrigation schedule. It is important to recognize that all embodiments of the present invention do not receive or transmitted ET data directly, nor use sensor data to calculate ET, nor store current or historical ET to determine the baseline irrigation schedule. Historical ET and/or other historical data may only be used as one way to develop a WBP curve for a location. In embodiments utilizing the derived sets of daily water budget percentages, an existing controller may be programmed with a summer irrigation schedule. Such a summer schedule may be obtained from prior experience, with professional assistance, or using various published guidelines that allow the user to factor in such items as landscape vegetation type, precipitation rate, soil type slope, and/or location to determine an appropriate summer irrigation schedule. The water budget percentages (WBP) may then be determined with reference to this summer schedule, so that daily deviations from the summer schedule may be made using the WBPs. Accordingly, the percentages during hotter times of the year are large (e.g. a given day in June may be 98%), resulting watering times nearly equal to the peak summer run times; but in cooler times of the year, the percentages are generally smaller (e.g. a given day in October may be only 35%), resulting in shorter watering station run times or longer intervals between watering cycles, depending upon the method selected. In preferred embodiments, with the lowest cost and simplest to install and program, the selected bell curve (or portion thereof) provides daily or periodic water budget percentages (WBPs) that are added (accumulated), so that watering is delayed until a certain threshold is reached, at which time watering is allowed to occur according to the preferred summer run time. During the hot times of the year, these embodiments would ordinarily result in a daily or near daily irrigation cycles; but during the cooler times of the year, the percentages are much smaller resulting in an increased interval between irrigation cycles since it would take more days for the accumulations to reach the threshold. In embodiments with precipitation sensors described below, if rainfall has been detected, irrigation could be further delayed. In some WBP embodiments, optional environmental sensors may be employed to determine whether there has been recent precipitation, and in these embodiments, watering may be delayed if such precipitation has been detected. The output from an environmental sensor (e.g. a precipitation sensor or rain switch) may go directly into the microprocessor of either the controller or add-on module. In these embodiments, the microprocessor determines how long the rain delay should be, and may be instructed to pause the watering interval until the rain delay period has ended, then resume normal operation, much like the “pause” feature of a DVR. After 10 years of smart product development, public education, and studies, the industry is still searching for more effective, simpler, cost effective means of water conservation than ET based or soil moisture based methods. Embodiments of the present invention present simple alternatives to water conservation without the use of ET, soil moisture sensors, complicated programming, high cost, or monthly service fees. The WBP embodiments do not use any form of ET or smart water technology as defined by the industry. Instead they use a pre-determined watering interval for a particular time or day of the year to approximate the watering needs of the landscape materials. Combining an educated estimate for watering needs with an optional simple sensor (such as a rain switch and/or a temperature sensor) provides for better watering efficiency than mandated watering restrictions and inefficient ET or soil based methods. Other embodiments of the present invention rely upon the time of year, current local temperature data, and information particular to the geographic location, to calculate and adjust one or more irrigation schedules on a daily or periodic basis. These embodiments satisfy the definition of “smart” controller by using current temperature data and the information concerning the invention's geographic location to calculate a periodic (preferably daily) water budget ratio which is used to alter, adjust and/or modify one or more irrigation schedules. This is accomplished by comparing current geo-environmental data to historical geo-environmental data and calculating a percentage of water for the current day compared to a peak, summer or other benchmark irrigation schedule. Minimizing the number of climatic variables and simplifying the calculation in this manner renders the present invention easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain, and therefore, much more appealing to the public. The present invention also provides apparatus and methods to combine simple temperature budgeting with time of use (TOU) to offer residential, commercial, municipal users and water districts options that best meet the needs of their local and regional water related issues. It is important to note that the present method does not use any environmental data to calculate ET, nor use any historically stored ET, nor does it transmit or receive ET. For about twenty years, most irrigation controllers have had a “seasonal adjust” or water budget feature as part of their functions. This allowed the user to manually set a percentage of the original run time settings and alter the run times by the set percentage. For example, if the run time for station 5 was 10 minutes and station 7 was for 20 minutes, setting the water budget to 70% would adjust those run times to 7 minutes and 14 minutes respectively. Embodiments of the present invention automate the station run time percentage feature by the aforementioned selected “bell” curves, or portions thereof, or in other embodiments, by varying the watering interval with daily (or periodic) accumulation of the bell curve percentages until a threshold is reached. The bell curves obtained and used by the WBP embodiments of the present invention may be a result of temperature budgeting calculations obtained by the algorithm described herein which are compared to ET based methods in FIGS. 1 and 1A . The preferred water conserving smart technology methods of the present and previous physical embodiments of are sometimes referred to as “temperature budgeting,” and the calculated result is a water budget or water budget ratio (WBR) that can be used to modify irrigations schedules in a variety of ways. The terms “water budget” and “water budget ratio” may sometimes be interchanged, both referring to a percentage, and not a particular volume of water. The WBP embodiments include compilations of these daily WBR percentages into bell curves or portions thereof. One major difference between the use of temperature budgeting embodiments and some of the WBR embodiments is that the temperature budgeting embodiments used environmental sensors to calculate a current daily or periodic water budget percentage that was applied daily or by means of accumulation to alter the station run times or watering intervals; whereas in the WBP embodiments, the percentages are pre-calculated for each day or period, and simply applied to that day or period when it arrives. In some of the new embodiments of the present invention, a set of water budget percentages may be pre-determined for a given time period (e.g., a day, week, a month, a year), and that this set of pre-determined percentages are used in conjunction with a standard summer or peak watering schedule to provide daily deviations from the peak schedule. In some embodiments of the invention these daily deviations may also be affected by input from environmental sensors such as temperature, rain, solar radiation, wind, humidity, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, water budget percentage (WBP) curves appropriate for certain regions of the U.S. or abroad are stored into the controller, add-on or plug-in, or central broadcasting system. While no ET is used to calculate the water budget ratio or percentage, it should be noted that the ET based water budget bell curves of FIG. 1A is used for comparison with the temperature budgeting percentage curve from CIMIS data derived without using ET data are remarkably close. Thus, it is possible to use those percentages interchangeably. This allows for the storage of daily, weekly, monthly, or annual water budget percentages in the controller, add-on or plug-in without actually using ET for water budget calculations. By way of example, an existing non smart controller may be installed at a residence and programmed with a summer irrigation schedule appropriate for, in this example, Winterhaven, Fla. This summer schedule has already been determined by experience, professional assistance, and/or from landscape irrigation watering guidelines. The controller, AC or DC powered, operates every day except for the lawn mowing day or family barbeque day, for example. As stated previously, most of the waste of landscape irrigation water (except for system inefficiency or lack of a rain switch) is due to not adjusting the controller throughout the year, preferably on a daily basis. In this example, an add-on module of the present invention is provided with a set of water budget bell curves by the zip code as an exemplary means of selection. The zip code for Winter Haven is 33880 which selects the WBP bell curve that is shown as Winter Haven in FIG. 1A . This WBP curve could be one derived with the temperature budgeting method or ET based bell curve of percentages because they are so similar, or from RA, ground moisture, or any other environmental data sufficient to provide a reliable water budget percentage bell curve. If it is now October, according to the FIG. 1A bell curve of temperature budgeted or ET based percentages, today's percentage could be, for example, 60%. Assuming that the threshold percentage is 100%, the embodiment will not allow watering today. If tomorrow is 62%, that is added to today's percentage such that the threshold of 100% is exceeded. At that point, the next 24 hours (or some other designated time frame) is designated as a watering interval. If an optional precipitation sensor is provided, and if it is raining or has recently rained, that irrigation cycle will be either cancelled or postponed, depending on whether the precipitation sensor breaks the common line itself or provides rainfall data directly into the add-on microprocessor or controller microprocessor which controls the common line. In this example, assuming no rainfall, the accumulations in October will exceed 100% about every other day, so the controller will irrigate approximately once every other day. If the rain sensor merely breaks the common line as an add-on, irrigation is interrupted until the hygroscopic material in the rain switch dries out. If the rain sensor is a tipping bucket that provides actual rainfall data and is a plug-in directly into the controller microprocessor, the controller may be programmed to provide irrigation delay dependent upon the amount of rainfall data provided by the rain sensor. For example, if 0.10 inches of rain is detected, 12 hours of rain delay may be initiated. If 0.75 inches of rain is reported, 48 hours of rain delayed irrigation may be initiated. It is to be appreciated that in some embodiments, only a portion of the WBP curve may be utilized. For example, and without limitation, the WBP data may be used only during the summer months (using only that portion of the annual bell curve), and not used during the remainder of the year. By way of illustration and without limitation, a controller may be programmed for a full summer watering schedule during the months of May-September, during which time the WBPs are used to modify the schedule; however, the controller may be programmed with different watering schedule(s) during the months of October-April during which time the WBPs are not used. The temperature and percentage budgeting methods and embodiments of the present invention can be used with any irrigation controller system: AC, DC, battery, solar, water, wind, or ambient light powered, and with stand alone or central wired or wireless controllers, with or without remote programming, with wired or wireless sensors, as add-on modules to existing controllers that may be stand alone or independently or globally addressable as in a central control system, and in various combinations of these embodiments. Temperature budgeting embodiments of the present invention offer “smart water” technology that can also be used in the form of a module that may be mounted easily and inexpensively without a service fee at the irrigation valve(s) with independent valve operation from any existing controller. The present methods can also be combined with local communities time of use watering restrictions for full flexibility of choice of the method best suited for the local water related needs and conditions. Temperature based water budgeting is guided by the following universally understood concepts: 1. More water is required to irrigate landscape or crops during periods of warmer temperatures. 2. Less water or longer intervals between irrigation cycles are required during periods of cooler temperatures. 3. Little or no water is required or desired below a certain temperature, or during certain times of the year 4. No irrigation is required while it is raining, or for a period thereafter. 5. For compliance to published municipal watering schedules, or allowed (or disallowed) watering times of the day, devices or methods are provided that will automatically enforce compliance with the local watering mandates either alone or in combination with smart water technology as herein described. The methods and apparatus of the present invention may be provided in a commercially available device having some or all of the following components: a means for an operator to enter data into the controller, such as a keyboard, touch screen, dial, magnetic card readers, remote or wireless device; a microprocessor or microcontroller to compute and adjust the irrigation schedule according to the present invention, based upon internal and external data; one or more data storage means (which may or may not be integrated with the processor), such as random access or read-only memory chips, or hard drives, containing the present invention and zip code or latitude and extraterrestrial radiation lookup tables and other data used herein, and storing the preliminary and adjusted irrigation schedules; a power source, either alternating-current (AC), direct-current (DC), battery, solar, ambient light, water, or wind powered; at least one temperature sensor, which may be provided in a separate unit that is in communication with the microprocessor (e.g., through a physical hard-wired connection, a wireless connection or radio transmission), or may be a component built into the irrigation controller; and means for controlling or limiting the water used by an irrigation system, such as cutoff switches or adjustable valves. Additional optional features include at least one precipitation sensor, at least one relative humidity sensor, and a global positioning system (GPS). The precipitation and/or relative humidity sensor(s) may be provided in separate unit(s) that are in communication with the microprocessor (e.g., through a physical hard-wired connection, a wireless connection or radio transmission), or they may be components built into the irrigation controller. It is to be appreciated that each of the sensors may constantly or periodically provide a signal or input of raw data to the controller that is read, processed and used in determining the water budget ratio that will be applied to the irrigation schedule without performing any calculation of ET. The GPS system may also be provided in a separate (optionally removable) unit, or it may be integrated with the controller unit as well. Some embodiments of the present invention are installed within a common poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC) irrigation pipe. The pipe may be inserted into the ground so that it extends only slightly above the ground to offer improved wireless reception. This placement minimizes the profile of the controller, increasing the aesthetic appeal of the surrounding environment and reducing the likelihood of vandalism. The controller utilizes wireless communication means (such as radio or infrared), allowing the operator to program the apparatus remotely. A temperature sensor is installed within the pipe at a position that minimizes sun-loading effects. Such a location may be near or just below ground level, or on top of the pipe under a shaded and ventilated cover. An optional precipitation sensor, with or without a rain-catcher, may be mounted at the top end of the pipe to detect rainfall, or at another location in wired or wireless communication with the controller. A preferred embodiment is battery-powered, using commercially available technology emphasizing energy conservation and the long-distance operation of irrigation valves. Significantly extended battery life, and the extended range of DC valve operations, such as those disclosed in this inventor's U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,914,847 and 6,351,366, allows the controller to be placed in remote areas, without the need for AC power or solar panels. Such battery power minimizes the dangers of power surges and outages, and improves electrical safety and aesthetic appeal. It also eliminates the installation and maintenance cost of power meters, and their unattractiveness in the landscaped area. Alternative embodiments provide for an irrigation controller or module to be housed within a valve box, with externally mounted temperature and optional precipitation, relative humidity, or wind sensor(s) affixed upon the valve box or elsewhere, and provided in wired or wireless communication with the controller or module. The unit may be powered by using any one or more of the power sources described above, depending upon its particular placement relative to such available sources. This approach may be better suited for certain residential, commercial, and turf irrigation applications. A shortcoming of a valve box battery powered controller, it may not be practical to install an external rain and temperature sensor. In commercial use with AC power, the operator first attaches the irrigation controller or module to an existing irrigation system. This can be done at any time of the year, not merely during the summer months. He also installs the temperature sensor within the target geographical area, and initiates its communication with the controller. An optional readily available rain sensor and/or humidity sensor may also be installed, and placed in communication with the controller. Finally, an optional GPS system may also be installed and placed in communication with the controller. With more sophisticated methods that can be used worldwide, the operator initially programs the controller using either a data entry device at or on the controller or its enclosure, or using wireless or radio input that is received by the controller. The programming steps are as follows: the user first enters the current date and time (e.g., time-of-day, month, day, and year). The user then enters the expected summer high (referred to herein as the “stored” or “standard”) temperature at the particular controller location. The user then provides the latitudinal location of the controller. The latitudinal location may be determined by the operator from information provided by various sources, such as online databases or a reference chart in the controller owner's manual. Alternatively, the latitudinal location may be determined by the controller itself when the operator enters the local zip code, the controller using an internal lookup table to match the zip code with an approximate latitude. An exemplary initial setup screen would thus have an appearance similar to the following: Current Time/Date: 10:15 AM Feb. 15, 2004 Expected Summer High Temperature: 98° F. Latitude of this Location: 36 N As an alternative to entering the local latitude and average summer high temperature, and as the preferred embodiment, the end user may simply enter a local 5-digit zip code. In 1993, Oregon State University developed a Spatial Climate Analysis Study. The result was entitled the “PRISM” model (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) which takes all the zip codes in the United States and reports 10, 20 and 30 year averages of various climatological data such as maximum, minimum and average temperatures, rainfall, etc. The study took 4 kilometer square areas of the United States, and using the closest weather stations, interpolated the meteorological parameters taking into account topography such as elevation and proximity to water bodies. This study and data is recognized by the USDA National Resources Conservation Service, the Forest Service, and the NOAA Office of Global Programs. By entering a zip code into the controller, the latitude and average summer high temperature may be automatically determined using such stored historical data. This eliminates the need for the user to enter the local latitude and estimated summer high temperature manually, simplifying the programming procedure further. This approach still requires providing the controller with an initial (summer) irrigation schedule. An example programming screen for this approach appears as follows: Current time/date: 10:15 AM Feb. 15, 2004 Local zip code: 93711 In other embodiments, a GPS system is provided either with the controller or module, or in a separate, optionally removable unit. Upon power up, the GPS system determines the location (through satellite communication or the like), which is provided to the controller. Then, as with the zip codes discussed above, the latitude and/or average summer high temperature may be automatically determined from stored historical non ET based data using the position information from the GPS system, instead of user input. The user must still provide an initial irrigation schedule. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, since the controller is not generally intended to be moved after it is deployed, the GPS system may be removed after the controller position is determined and downloaded, with the position information stored in non-volatile memory. Alternatively, the GPS system may be part of the deployed controller system, and remain with it. As an alternative to the GPS method or zip code entry from which the controller or module internally determines the latitude and the average summer high temperature for that PRISM cell, that information or zip code could be inputted by the local irrigation distributor along with the date and the local time at or before the time of delivery of the unit. In this manner, the end user would only have to program the controller for its summer irrigation schedule and connect the temperature sensor and optional other sensors. The controller requires a preliminary (preferably summer) irrigation schedule. This may be a default schedule, or an initial schedule provided by the operator. This preliminary schedule may be obtained from a system designer, consultant, equipment distributor or architect, any of whom may recommend an appropriate summer irrigation schedule based on the soil type, slope, variety of landscape vegetation, types of valves and sprinklers, and water available for that particular area. The controller or module then automatically determines the extraterrestrial radiation factor (RA) for the standard date and location from a look-up table stored within the unit. The RA utilized by this invention must be distinguished from the solar radiation value (Rn or Rs) provided by weather stations and sensors, and utilized by ETo formulas. Specifically, RA is a function of the angle at which the sun strikes the earth at various times of the year at various latitudes, while solar radiation is a measure of the actual intensity of sunlight at a particular time. The zip code entry (or other location information input) determines the latitude and the historical average summer high temperature for that zip code/location. The latitude in turn determines the extraterrestrial radiation factor, which comprise the stored historical geo-environmental data of this invention. The controller or module then automatically calculates the standard temperature budget factor (STBF) using the summer high temperature, its date and the latitude, and any number of relatively simple formulas utilizing the RA value for the high temperature date. Specifically, and as described in greater detail herein, one method of calculating the STBF is to multiply the high summer temperature (from a stored table, or provided by the operator) by an RA (the RA determined by the particular geographic location of the controller, and either the estimated date of the summer high temperature or the average summer RA values for the particular geographic location). The STBF is then stored within the controller and used for subsequent determinations of the water budget ratio (WBR), as described in greater detail herein. The controller or module also obtains the actual high temperature and RA for the particular current period, the former from its temperature sensor and the latter from its internal look-up table. Such periodic data is used to calculate the periodic temperature budget factor (PTBF). The PTBF is calculated utilizing the same formula for calculating the STBF, but using currently available data. In one aspect of the invention, the controller or module then computes the WBR by dividing the PTBF by the STBF. This ratio is then used to adjust the preliminary irrigation schedule for that particular period. In this aspect of the invention, preliminary irrigation schedule may be multiplied by the WBR to obtain the modified (actual) irrigation schedule. The present invention then irrigates the irrigation area pursuant to the modified irrigation schedule, as described in greater detail herein. Because the present method relationally adjusts the irrigation station times or varies the watering schedule or watering days, it is suitable for nearly all conditions and locations. It inherently compensates for all of the characteristics and specifications of the existing irrigation system—unlike the prior art, it does not require multiple complicated formulas or variables. The method also inherently compensates for particular environmental conditions. For example, it may be applied to the “cycle and soak” method commonly utilized for sloped landscapes, since the present method increases or decreases the initial irrigation schedule for the sloped landscape based upon the WBR. Several alternative embodiments of the present invention provide a temperature budgeting module outside of a stand-alone irrigation controller. Such a module is placed along the output path of an existing irrigation controller, so that it intercepts and processes any signals (typically the 24 VAC) from the controller to the irrigation system. Such modules permit the operator to add the desired features described herein to any existing irrigation controller without replacing the old controller entirely. In most embodiments, such a module will include a temperature sensor for use in determining current local temperature, to be used in calculating the WBR as described herein. In other embodiments, such a module may include additional optional sensors (e.g. precipitation, relative humidity, wind, etc.). In other embodiments, such a module may include a receiver for receiving a signal containing the WBR. In other embodiments, the signal received by the module may include any or all of the following information: current temperature, precipitation/wind information, and/or other information that is used by the module to calculate the WBR. Other alternative embodiments of the present invention permit the operator to install the present invention upon an existing irrigation controller by making the appropriate software changes to the instruction set of the controller, and by adding a temperature sensor to an available input port. Some embodiments of the present invention do not require the operator to input the actual date of the expected high temperature. Instead, the present invention may assume that such date occurs during the summer months, and average the RAs for the summer months to obtain an average RA for the STBF calculation. Other embodiments of the present invention allow the operator to input the temperature, date and preliminary irrigation schedule for any time of the year. The present invention then determines the STBF from such data. The WBR remains accurate due to the ratio relationship between the PTBF and STBF, as described herein. Other alternative embodiments of the present invention utilize AC power instead of battery power. While the latter is the preferred embodiment herein because it is the most technically challenging due to its power availability limitations, residential applications constitute over half of all landscape irrigation controllers, and virtually all of these residential controllers are AC-powered. Such embodiments may be installed anywhere upon the residential property, such as within a garage. They may be operated by input means built into the controller, or by wireless transmission from a remote. The temperature and rain sensors are mounted outdoors to measure ambient temperature, at various locations (such as the eave of the garage). These sensors may be hardwired to the controller or in short-range wireless communication with the controller. The method of calculating the WBR, and the operation of the cutoff switches and valves, remain unchanged. Optional procedures may also be incorporated into the present invention. For example, after entering the expected summer high temperature and latitude or the zip code, the operator may specify the minimum irrigation temperature. This insures that the irrigation schedule is not activated when the temperature is near or below a certain point, such as freezing temperature. Such minimum temperature requirement serves two primary purposes—first, to conserve water, and second, to protect the safety of vehicles and pedestrians traveling through the irrigation zone during freezing temperatures. A second option permits the operator to further adjust the irrigation schedule according to the particular circumstances and/or limitations, such as the water delivery method utilized by the irrigation system, the specifications of the system, or the type of plants being watered. This allows the operator to fine-tune the irrigation schedule based upon personal experience, observations or unusual field situations. A third option is to attach a commonly available precipitation sensor to the irrigation controller, either directly or indirectly as a separate unit in communication with the irrigation controller (e.g., through a physical hard-wired connection, a wireless connection or radio transmission) or as a component built into the irrigation controller, so that the controller may detect the occurrence of rainfall and suppress the irrigation schedule during the affected periods. The particular effect of current or recent precipitation upon the irrigation schedule may be determined by the operator. For example, the operator may cause the present invention to suppress the irrigation schedule if precipitation occurred within the previous twenty-four hours, or only if precipitation is occurring at the particular moment of irrigation. It is to be appreciated that a precipitation sensor (switch or precipitation measuring device) may periodically or constantly provide a signal or input to the controller or module that is read, processed and used in determining the water budget ratio that will be applied to the irrigation schedule, and that the mere presence of such a signal alone is not sufficient to terminate any irrigation cycle. The precipitation sensor may be a rain switch or rain sensor that measures actual rainfall. In some embodiments, the signal may only be provided once, or at periodic intervals, during which the controller reads and stores the data from the signal. Then, at a later time (such as just before an irrigation cycle is scheduled to commence), the controller processes the previously read and stored data to determine whether to shorten or skip the irrigation cycle. It is to be appreciated that at the time this processing is done, the signal may no longer be present. In other embodiments, the previously disclosed controller or module housed inside a PVC pipe may be alternately mounted inside a valve box. A number of manufacturers offer valve box controllers in residential or commercial applications. These controllers are virtually all battery powered, as described by this inventor's U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,855 entitled “Battery powered programmable remote switch controller.” Temperature budgeting could be incorporated into these controllers which can be programmed directly by removing the valve box cover and inputting the irrigation program by means of data entry switches, or by downloading the program by using a portable programming unit which is then plugged into to the valve box controller. These valve box controllers can also be programmed by a wireless hand held programmer. These controllers would incorporate the same geo-environmental (non ET based) data as previously described (summer average high temperature and latitude or zip code) which can be obtained from the PRISM model and calculate the water budget ratio with the daily high temperature data from a wired or wireless temperature sensor. In this and other embodiments, a central temperature sensor or other regional broadcast of temperature could be used to provide the temperature and rain information to a large number of valve box controllers over a wide area with common latitude and average high temperature. In cases where a central broadcasting temperature/rain sensor system is not available or feasible, or it is not practical to mount a temperature sensor near the valve box above the ground, an alternative approach provides the battery powered valve box controller with its zip code or other local geographic information, which determines the STBF. With the PRISM data, it is feasible to provide the valve box controller with its daily or periodic historical RA and average temperatures, providing the means for an approximate WBR calculation. While this is not a real time WBR calculation, it is an improvement over no periodic water budget adjustment, therefore saving the labor of frequent water budget adjustments during the course of the year, resulting in some water conservation. In other embodiments of the present invention, the controller or module (AC or DC, solar, inside valve box, etc.) does not itself calculate the WBR. A centrally located processor with rain and temperature sensors is pre-programmed with the 5-digit zip code or other local geographic identification information, which determines the average summer high temperature and latitude for that and other environmentally similar zip codes. As noted previously, zip codes are preferred for use within the U.S. because of their simplicity. For worldwide applications where there are no zip codes, the summer average high temperature and latitude can be substituted. This apparatus can be called a CBM (Central Broadcast Module). While measuring the daily temperature and monitoring for rain with any one of a variety of commonly available rain switches, rain tipping buckets, or the like, embodiments of the centrally located processor calculate the WBR and transmit the WBR percentage to all controllers or modules within their range in a wired or wireless configuration. The CBM may or may not also transmit any weather sensor data to the remote controllers or modules. Typically, these embodiments forward only the calculated WBR by wired or wireless means, much like ET data is currently transmitted to irrigation controllers. However, in alternative embodiments, other data (e.g., temperature, wind, precipitation, and/or controller/module identification information) may also be transmitted. The basic water budget factor is the WBR=PTBF/STBF, as discussed previously. In a wireless configuration incorporating a rain switch or some other sensor, this equation can be further refined as follows: WBR M =STBR/PTBF×ESF where WBR M is the modified water budget ratio (modified based on the additional sensor input), and ESF is the Environmental Sensor Factor, which can consist of a rain, wind, humidity, or solar sensor, or combinations thereof. As an example, when the rain switch is closed (when it is not raining), ESF=1, not affecting the WBR. In the case of rain, this factor can be a small number (less than 1) decreasing the WBR M to a percentage at or near 0. The same method is used to restrict or eliminate irrigation during cold temperatures if the temperature is below a set point. In this embodiment, the WBR is calculated remotely outside the controller or module and transmitted to the controller(s) or module(s) within its hard-wired or wireless proximity. This embodiment is suitable for battery powered valve box controllers, commercial AC or DC powered controllers, or central control systems in larger projects such as parks, schools, golf courses, and large apartment complexes. There are a number of advantages to this remote approach to transmitting the WBR using a CBM: 1. The individual controllers do not have to be programmed individually by zip codes. Even the current time and date can be transmitted to the remote field or slave controllers from the central processor. 2. There are no significant data storage requirements for the remote controllers. All the zip code information and look up tables are eliminated as this data is incorporated into the CBM. The remote controllers merely execute the water budget ratio prescribed by the central processor suitable for their local area. 3. This simplifies the modifications to the software in each of the remote controllers. Since most irrigation controllers already incorporate a method of changing the watering times by means of a manually-entered universal water budgeting software, it would be a simple conversion to automate this budgeting method with the temperature budgeting WBR approach. In yet another embodiment that demonstrates the extensive flexibility of the temperature budgeting method of the present invention, a temperature budgeting module (TBM) may be provided between any existing irrigation controller's output and its cutoff switches (valves). At this point, a distinction is made between the CBM (central broadcasting module) and the TBM (temperature budgeting module). In most embodiments, both the CBM and the TBM are capable of calculating a daily (or periodic) watering budget by comparing the historical average summer high temperature at that location and the daily high temperature readings and the time of the year. If additional sensors are provided, a WBR M may also be calculated. However, in some embodiments, the WBR (or WBR M ) is calculated by the CBM and broadcast to one or more TBMs (or controllers). Such TBMs (or controllers) in these instances do not have to perform the WBR (or WBR M ) calculation, and therefore do not require their own temperature (or other) sensors. These TBMs (or controllers) then modify their associated irrigation schedules according to the WBR (or WBR M ) received. It is to be appreciated that the calculations provided by the present invention are frequently expressed as a water budget ratio (WBR). This is done to clarify that the resulting calculation is a percentage, or as commonly referred to in the industry as the “seasonal adjust” or the “water budget” feature, which is a ratio of two numbers, and to insure that the water budget is not misinterpreted as a volume of water (such as a number of gallons, cubic feet, or acre feet). In this invention, the terms “water budget” and “water budget ratio” and “seasonal adjust” may sometimes be interchanged, both meaning a percentage of the original set station run times or schedules, and not a budgeted volume of water. It is to be appreciated that when the term “water budget” or “water budget ratio” are used, that they are not to be limited to any particular algorithm presented here, such as the temperature budgeting embodiments. Embodiments of the invention can automate the water budget feature using temperature budgeting, soil moisture data, or ET as represented by a resulting water budget bell curve particular to a certain zip code or location or region. Also, it is to be noted that the use or transmission of the WBR or WBP is a percentage (by definition) and not a transmission of ET. The temperature sensor, and optional rain, wind, humidity, solar and/or other sensors (used for WBR M calculations) may be hard wired to or incorporated integrally with the CBM microprocessor for the WBR or WBR M calculation, and the CBM then provides a percentage (water budget ratio—WBR or WBR M ) of summer irrigation to one or more irrigation controllers (or modules), by wired or wireless means. Each controller or module receiving the WBR or WBR M uses it to adjust the output durations, watering days, and/or watering intervals (watering schedules). These methods would normally require hardware and software changes within the controllers to accept and process the WBR or WBR M . However, TBMs containing the appropriate programming may be installed with existing controllers to receive the WBR or WBR M from the CBM, and accomplish the modification of the controller's irrigation schedule(s) without having to make modifications to the controller. From programming viewpoint, using a TBM means that no user programming change is required in the controller. A typical TBM requires no controller hardware, software, or programming changes in the existing controller, and is compatible with any new or existing 24 VAC output controller (about 90% of all controllers). With minimal adaptations, it is also compatible with DC controllers. It affects valve operation directly either at the outputs of an irrigation controller, as shown in FIG. 13 , or at the valves in the field as shown in FIG. 13E and described below in example 4. A small inexpensive module is placed at each valve or set of valves, and can modify valve operating time without having to change or modify existing controllers. It is estimated that scores of millions of controllers are in current use and operating about 100 million valves in the U.S. The TBM embodiment allows every irrigation system valve and controller to be temperature budgeted without changing controllers, valves, or the wiring from the controller to the valves. The TBM can be programmed with its zip code by any number of methods such as being pre-programmed at the factory based upon its sales destination, programmed upon receipt at the retail or wholesale location, or field programmed by means of a small display and/or adjusting switches. By way of example only, and without limiting the foregoing, one method of programming the zip code is with a dip switch labeled numerically from 0 to 9. If the zip code is, for example, 93711, the #9 dip switch is flipped on for one second and turned off, then the #3 dip switch turned on for one second and turned off, then the #7, then the #1, then #1 again. Or, five dip switches may be provided, with each switch being set to correspond to one of the digits of the 5-digit zip code. Using dip switches eliminates the need for a display or entry buttons, thereby reducing cost and size, and improving reliability. Other simple non-display data inputs are also contemplated in this embodiment. In some applications, a display may be preferred for visible ease of programming, particularly if a combination of smart technology is combined with time of use. In a typical existing residential application, the homeowner may use an existing controller mounted in the garage. The user would normally already know the summer irrigation schedule based upon the original system design, or by experience. A temperature sensor with or without a rain switch is mounted outside the garage and the wires are routed to the TBM. The power to the TBM may be derived from the commonly existing 24 VAC transformer powering the existing controller, or the TBM may be self-battery powered. A typical residential irrigation system may have from 2 to 8 valves. The output from the controller to each valve is first wired to the input of the TBM (along with the wiring common). The output of the TBM is wired to the existing wires attached to the valves. Once these connections are made, the user programs the controller with its summer irrigation schedule during any time of the year and proceeds to operate the system as if it were summer. If no watering is desired at the time of the TBM setup, the common to the valves from the TBM could be disconnected so no actual irrigation occurs. The homeowner may then activate the summer watering program by either programming an automatic start or performing a manually initiated semi-automatic cycle. The activated stations are each typically powered with 24 VAC, which is intercepted by the TBM. When the stations go off after the appropriate summer irrigation watering durations, the TBM microprocessor remembers the operating time of each station. Once every utilized station has been activated with its summer irrigation duration, the TBM stores that information within its memory. After this initial “training” or “learning” session, the common to the valves is reconnected for normal operation. The TBM uses the zip code information as discussed previously to calculate the STBF for that specific location. It then uses the temperature reading from its externally mounted temperature sensor to calculate its PTBF from which the WBR is calculated. Each day, a new WBR is calculated by the TBM. Upon the next start of an irrigation cycle, as each station comes on, the TBM recognizes which station is activated from the output which is energized. Once the percentage of the summer schedule is reached, the TBM turns off the output prior to the end of its summer run time. The run time for each successive station is adjusted similarly. By this method, any existing controller, (residential or commercial) can be adapted to save irrigation water by adjustment of its output running time. Since it is recommended that deficit irrigation is preferred to over-irrigating, it is not likely that much more than 100% of summer irrigation would be required or necessary for the healthy growth of landscape vegetation. An optional rain switch or sensor can be used to terminate the irrigation altogether with its signal to the TBM or the controller by means of a pre-determined reduced water budget percentage. An override method may also be supplied to the TBM which would allow manual operation of valves for maintenance purposes without disrupting the previously set irrigation time(s). This override can be in the form of a pushbutton or other switch which directs the TBM to ignore its WBR for that day or for some other suitable period of time. No time of day or accounting for daylight saving time is required to be programmed within the TBM because it is only looking for a 24 VAC signal from the controller outputs. Only the date and month is needed for the WBR calculation, and these can be pre-set at the factory. It does not matter where within the U.S. the TBM is located since a time shift of a few hours does not affect the WBR calculation which is based on the day of the month. See FIG. 13 for a typical TBM installation. The signal from the temperature sensor to the TBM can be wired or wireless. The TBM itself is not an irrigation controller but a water budget calculator and proportional valve activator. See example 8 below for a discussion of a TBM mounted at a valve. It is to be appreciated that in some embodiments, the temperature budgeting modules (TBMs) that are installed between existing controllers and their valves are capable of receiving the signal broadcast from a CBM. In these embodiments, instead of containing programming to calculate a WBR or WBR M , these TBMs receive the WBR from a CBM, and then utilize the WBR in the same way as other TBMs described previously. These TBMs may be programmed to recognize that a broadcast of a reduced WBR (e.g., a WBR of 1% or less) means not to water on that day. In an alternate method of modifying the irrigation schedule while using temperature budgeting, a threshold minimum water budget percentage level can be programmed into the controller, CBM, or TBM. For example, because of a non-porous soil condition, it may be preferred that deeper irrigation occurs to insure efficient watering into the vegetation root zone. Deeper watering generally requires a longer watering time. During colder months of the year, a certain day may have a temperature based calculated water budget of, for example, 12%. If the original summer run time was set for 8 minutes, the resulting irrigation would only be about 1 minute. In most cases, this is of little or no value to watering the plant root zone with low porosity soil. It may therefore be more efficient to both feeding the root zone and conserving water to set a minimum irrigation threshold of, for example, 60% of the summer station operating (run) time to allow for deep penetration. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the controller, TBM or CBM is programmed or instructed to accumulate the daily water budget percentages (e.g., the exemplary 12% daily budget above) until the 60% level is reached. The calculated water budget for each day is added until the threshold level is reached, which may result in a delay of four or five days before enabling irrigation. If the accumulation day falls upon a non-watering day in communities that have watering day restrictions, the budget is further accumulated until an allowed watering day is reached. (See FIG. 4A for the flow diagram illustrating this process.) In this manner, the same amount of the calculated watering need is supplied, but instead of watering for small percentages of time each day, deep watering occurs on an allowed day after a desired accumulation level is met, for more efficient irrigation, particularly in poorly porous soil conditions. As mentioned previously, other embodiments combine the temperature budgeting smart water technology discussed above with the time of use method of restricting allowable watering days. The local community can choose to implement smart technology according to the present invention in numerous ways, including without limitation (i) incorporated within the controller to make it smart, (ii) added on as a TBM that can alter the outputs of any existing irrigation controller to make it smart, and/or (iii) as a CBM that communicates with one or a multitude of controllers or modules for selective or universal adjustments of remote controllers' station watering durations or watering schedules with the budget accumulation method, or by changing the watering intervals based upon the WBR. In some fast growing communities, another significant water related issue is of great concern. Even if those communities have sufficient water supply, they may not have the pumping capacity or water delivery infrastructure to deliver that water. As a consequence, the delivered water pressure is inadequate for all water uses, including domestic and landscape needs. Those communities have adopted restrictions on landscape watering schedules such as even or odd watering days, meaning that even numbered homes may water on even days of the month, and odd numbered homes may water on odd days of the month. However, these types of watering restrictions are manually programmed into the controllers with no automation to maximize water conservation. Some other methods are to limit irrigation to certain days of the week or certain times of the day. Once again, these schedules may change during the course of the year, and no automation is provided for doing so. The result is that there is a low level of compliance to these restrictions. An automated means of municipally set watering restrictions can both be more convenient to the user (normally the homeowner), but also save more water and pumping energy, and decrease the delivery load. Decreasing the delivery load can also insure more consistent water pressure, thereby allowing for better irrigation efficiency, thereby further saving water and energy. In larger commercial and municipal applications, central based irrigation systems are frequently used. Rain Bird® Maxicom2®, Rainmaster Evolution™, or the Toro Sentinel™ are examples of centrally controlled irrigation systems. Typically, a custom software package is loaded onto a dedicated computer at a central office and the irrigation schedules for a multitude of field (satellite) controllers are entered onto this central computer. A wireless signal (radio, satellite, pager, or the like) is transmitted to the field controllers directing them to operate the valves under their local control. Generally, all system operations can be controlled and/or monitored from the central computer. ET based data is commonly provided to those central systems by means of a local weather station or wireless ET data from an ET service provider. As an alternative to ET, embodiments of the present invention (e.g., a CBM) can provide the WBR or WBR M information to such a central computer which would then modify the irrigation schedules under its control, and periodically broadcast the updated irrigation schedules/programs to the field controllers as modified by the WBR or WBR M . The CBM may be hardwired to the computer through a USB port, RS232 input, or wirelessly provided to the PC with an interface receiver module. In alternative embodiments, the necessary data and programming for computing the WBR may be incorporated into the central computer itself, and a communication link (wired or wireless) established to a local temperature sensor. In this way, the same central computer can receive the temperature information, calculate the WBR, and modify the irrigation schedules of the controllers under its control. If any of the optional environmental sensors (precipitation, wind, humidity, etc.) are used, the central computer may also use this information to calculate a WBR M and provide appropriate modified instructions to the controllers under its control. With any of the herein described methods, all irrigation stand alone controller models incorporating the present invention would appear, install, and program virtually identically to their non-smart predecessor. This approach would have great advantages from a manufacturing and marketing standpoint for the manufacturers: 1. Front panel programming remains virtually identical to non-smart models. 2. Same plastic molds for enclosures and front panels and other parts the same. 3. No need to resubmit units in most cases for updated Underwriters Laboratories testing for safety. 4. Controller is the same size and shape and mounts interchangeably with previous unit, including its wiring. 5. Same programming means that manufacturer's salesmen, sales representatives, inside technical support, distributors, or contractors would not have to be retrained. 6. End users would already be familiar and comfortable with the new temperature budgeting smart models. 7. Temperature budgeted smart controllers would meet the California requirements for smart water technology by 2012. 8. Should meet the national EPA WaterSense labeling requirements. 9. Qualifies for smart controller rebates in areas where available. 10. Temperature budgeting has no monthly service fees. 11. Requires no expensive weather station. 12. Extremely cost effective to manufacture. 13. Simplest programming controller available. 14. If provided as a CBM, can provide wireless smart technology to a large number of irrigation controllers. 15. If manufactured as a Time of Use and Smart controller combination, provides various communities the choice of using one or both technologies within one enclosure within the controller, in TBM module, or as a centrally broadcast (CBM) water saving or infrastructure demand reducing means. There may be applications where there is no convenient location for locating a temperature sensor and/or a precipitation sensor. One such example may be a street median where it is unsightly to mount a temperature sensor or precipitation sensor on a tall pole. In addition, the controller may not be equipped to receive a wireless signal from a CBM. It would be very convenient if such a field (outdoor) controller with temperature budgeting software be self-contained. There are several problems to be overcome in order to accomplish this self contained embodiment. The first is that the temperature sensor must not be exposed to vandalism. Secondly, placement of the temperature sensor must be such that it should obtain a reasonably accurate ambient temperature reading. Issues concerning the optional precipitation sensor are that it should also not be subject to vandalism, that it be exposed to precipitation, but not exposed to the irrigation sprinklers themselves for the purposes of obtaining a modified water budget ratio. In most applications, mounting environmental sensors on a separate pole is undesirable, aesthetically unpleasing, impractical, costly, or prone to vandalism. Research and experiments have shown that mounting the temperature sensor at or near the ground inside a pedestal (metal or non-metallic), provides temperature readings that closely approximate the ambient temperature. This avoids “sun loading” effects in an enclosure such as a pedestal that can increase the temperature reading by as much as 30% during the summer and adversely affect the water budget calculations. In addition, it is possible to mount a precipitation sensor only slightly elevated above the controller enclosure, or entirely within the enclosure (See FIGS. 18A and 18B ). These embodiments provide a completely self-contained (outdoor mounted) controller with smart water technology. A precipitation or other sensor(s) could be mounted securely and compactly on top of the pedestal in a sturdy metallic housing. It is therefore an important objective of the present invention to provide simple methods, systems and apparatus for irrigation water conservation by providing automated water budgeting and/or automated time of use restrictions, alone or in combination with each other. It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a variety of methods, systems and apparatus for irrigation water conservation that are naturally intuitive and that may be used in a variety of different configurations by people or entities in different circumstances. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus for conserving water by automatically adjusting irrigation schedules in response to varying climatic conditions. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus for conserving water by automatically adjusting irrigation schedules in accordance with pre-determined periodic percentages. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus for conserving water by automatically adjusting irrigation schedules in accordance with pre-determined periodic percentages together with time of use restrictions and/or current environmental data. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus that utilize greatly simplified local, real-time meteorological data to calculate and maintain the irrigation schedule. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus that minimize the margins and sources of error within the automatically and climatically adjusted irrigation schedules by limiting the number of variables and relationships necessary to calculate and maintain the schedules. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus that may be embodied into or used with any irrigation controller that is inexpensive to manufacture, install, operate and maintain. It is another objective of the present invention to provide practical water conservation methods, systems and apparatus means that can potentially save more water than theoretical ET methods because of its comparative cost and simplicity. It is another objective of the present invention to provide irrigation controllers that are capable of adjusting existing irrigation schedules according to the geographic location of the controller and a recent temperature reading, without using ET. It is another objective of the present invention to provide add on modules that may be used in conjunction with irrigation controllers to adjust the controller's irrigation schedules according to the geographic location of the module and a recent temperature reading, without using ET. It is another objective of the present invention to provide a central processor or system that calculates an adjustment to be made to irrigation schedules and provides that adjustment by wired or wireless means to receivers which use the adjustment to modify the irrigation schedules of the controllers they are associated with. It is another objective of the present invention to provide both smart water technology and time of use technology within a controller, within a TBM, or within a CBM in communication with one or more controllers or modules, in order to offer communities alternative choices for the most effective means to address their particular water related problems. It is another objective of the present invention to provide temperature budget smart water and/or time of use technology for use in central irrigation systems. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus for incorporating smart technology in the form of pre-calculated water budget percentage bell curves to controllers without the need for externally mounted environmental sensors. It is another objective of the present invention to provide add-ons or plug-ins having a pre-calculated water budget percentage curve alone or combined with time of use watering restrictions. It is another objective of the present invention to provide controllers with pre-calculated water budget percentage curves alone or combined with time of use watering restrictions. It is another objective of the present invention to provide methods, systems and apparatus that use modules that are added onto existing controllers to implement water budgeting, smart water and/or time of use technology without requiring the replacement of such controllers. Additional objects of the present invention shall be apparent from the detailed description and claims herein."
9058560,"Methods, apparatus and systems for generating, updating and executing an invasive species control plan",2012-02-13,1,1,"The present invention relates to methods, graphical user interfaces (GUI), computer-readable media, and systems for dynamically generating, updating, and executing an invasive species control plan. BACKGROUND In recent years, there has been an explosive proliferation of data of all forms and formats related to controlling invasive species. For the purposes of the present invention, invasive species are generally regarded as plant-based vegetation that is classified as invasive or considered undesirable, unnecessary, and/or harmful to the environment in which it is located or to other vegetation, animal, or persons in proximity. The process of controlling invasive species involves a series of actions performed to reduce, remove, and/or prevent from re-growing said invasive species and in some cases restoring the site to some defined state. The ability to find and then combine the relevant data into a solution to control invasive species and/or restore the impacted site has traditionally been left to the initiative, inventiveness, know-how, and experience of the individual creating the solution. Typically, people creating solutions to invasive species control problems intuitively determine their strategies based on the results of blind interne searches, available resources, past experiences, local knowledge, and opinions. Or, in some instances, a person may hire a consultant or a supplier to assist in the development of a Invasive species control plan. However, these practices often result in outcomes that are less than optimal or even less than may otherwise be achievable because they fail to account for many aspects of invasive species control; including the efficient utilization of resources and available time, financial considerations of the invasive species control plan, logistics (including the organization and movement of equipment, people, and supplies), land characteristics and constraints (including possible environmental and regulatory requirements), neighboring vegetation control issues, and other factors that contribute to optimizing invasive species control and achieving the desired outcomes. In addition, there can be contractual obligations that need to be considered, as well as the wishes and needs of the landlords, landowners, and in some case the neighbors and the public at large. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventor has recognized that intuitive invasive species control strategies do not leverage the benefits of remote sensing, social networking, and other systems and technologies. Nor do intuitive invasive species control strategies adapt well to unplanned events such as inclement weather, personnel issues, supply shortages, etc. In part, intuitive invasive species control plans suffer because it is difficult for people to modify their habits and practices in the face of broader trends and unplanned events. The present invention addresses these issues by generating, updating, and executing invasive species control plans that take into consideration a variety of such factors by employing technologies not previously exploited to such ends. Methods, apparatus, and systems for generating, updating, and executing an invasive species control plan are herein discussed. Information regarding the invasive species control plan may be received from a variety of sources, such as a user, a database, a data feed, a social network, a piece of equipment used to execute a portion of the invasive species control plan and/or a remote sensor via a communication network, such as the Internet, a cloud computing network, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or a wireless LAN (WLAN). The received information may be used to generate one or more invasive species control plans. Invasive species control plans may include, for example, a logistics plan that provides logistical options and instructions for the scheduling, movement, and use of equipment, supplies, people, and resources available for the execution of the invasive species control plan. It may also include site-specific recommendations and instructions, recommended treatments, recommended restorations, maps to aid in execution, recommended resource use, recommended equipment use, supplier data, information regarding supplies required (e.g., biological products, chemicals, seed, fertilizer, fuel, etc.), and recommended activities to be performed. The invasive species control plan may be updated over time and include status information of the portion of the invasive species control plan that has been completed, including data related to budgets, supplies consumed, supply shortages, resource capacity utilization, and accomplishments. In one embodiment, an invasive species control plan may include measures of plan effectiveness and efficiencies. One or more invasive species control plans may be evaluated by the invasive species control plan generator according to one or more criterion. A preferred invasive species control plan may then be selected by the invasive species control plan generator based upon the evaluation. The selected invasive species control plan may then be provided to the user via, for example, the communication network. In some cases, a plurality of invasive species control plans are selected and provided to the user. In other cases, a portion of an invasive species control plan may be provided to a user, an individual employee, or other designate of the user, or provided directly to the electronic systems of the equipment that is being used to execute all or a portion of the invasive species control plan. In some instances, additional information regarding the selected invasive species control plan may be received from, for example, the user, the manager, the database, the data feed, the equipment, and/or the remote sensor. The additional information may relate to, for example, new treatment research, site conditions, weather, pricing for the supplies and resources, equipment and personnel availability, operating costs, or status information regarding the progress to that point in executing the plan. The selected invasive species control plan may then be dynamically updated based upon the received additional information and the updated invasive species control plan may be provided to the user via a communication network.

8484890,Apparatus for aeroponically growing and developing plants,2012-07-16,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to aeroponics and, more particularly, growing plants in a gaseous environment. 2. Description of the Related Art Prior to the expansion of aeroponic devices for the growth and development of plants, people experimented with hydroponics, which is a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions instead of soil. Hydroponics is said to provide healthier plants that grow faster than those grown in soil. Although hydroponic plants are grown in the absence of soil, the roots are maintained in a liquid environment. Consequently, there is a lack of adequate ventilation at the roots from the continuous presence of water, which is the leading major cause of root disease. In an attempt to avoid root disease, botanists prefer aeroponics. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. Aeroponic growth has allowed growers to avoid plant-based diseases, such as Fusarium, Botrytis, Sclerotium, Verticillium , and Rhizoctonia , common in plants cultivated in soil and through hydroponics. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention address deficiencies of the art in respect to aeroponic growing and provide a novel and non-obvious system and apparatus for aeroponic growing. In an embodiment of the invention, an aeroponic growing system can be provided, which can include a distribution pipe coupled to a plurality of sprayers, and a plurality of plant supports. Each plant support can include a body. The body can include an upper panel, a lower panel, at least one opening adapted to retain a seed container formed on the upper panel, and at least one different opening formed on the upper panel adapted to receive a sprayer of the plurality of sprayers. Each plant support can further comprise a liquid nutrient solution guide in fluid communication with the interior of body and extending from the lower panel of the body. Another embodiment of the invention provides for an aeroponic growing tower. An aeroponic growing tower can include a first plant support having a first body. The first body can include an upper panel, a lower panel, and at least one opening adapted to retain a seed container being formed in the upper panel. The first plant support can further include a conical wall extending from the upper panel of the first body away from the first body and in fluid connection with an interior of the first body and a liquid nutrient solution guide in fluid communication with the interior of the first body and extending from the lower panel of the first body. The aeroponic growing tower can further include a second plant support coupled to the first plant support. The second plant support can have a second body. The second body can include an upper panel, a lower panel, and at least one opening adapted to retain a seed container being formed in the upper panel of the second body. The second plant support can further include a conical wall extending away from the upper panel of the second body. The conical wall can be in fluid communication with an interior of the second body and a second liquid nutrient solution guide can be in fluid communication with the second body and extending from the lower panel of the second body, wherein the first liquid nutrient solution guide can be disposed within the conical wall of the second body. Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed."
8915244,Concentrating solar power with glasshouses,2012-12-28,1,1,"BACKGROUND 1. Field Advancements in concentrated solar thermal power (CST), photovoltaic solar energy (PV), concentrated photovoltaic solar energy (CPV), and industrial use of concentrated solar thermal energy are needed to provide improvements in performance, efficiency, and utility of use. 2. Related Art Unless expressly identified as being publicly or well known, mention herein of techniques and concepts, including for context, definitions, or comparison purposes, should not be construed as an admission that such techniques and concepts are previously publicly known or otherwise part of the prior art. All references cited herein (if any), including patents, patent applications, and publications, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, whether specifically incorporated or not, for all purposes. Concentrated solar power systems use mirrors, known as concentrators, to gather solar energy over a large space and aim and focus the energy at receivers that convert incoming solar energy to another form, such as heat or electricity. There are several advantages, in some usage scenarios, to concentrated systems over simpler systems that directly use incident solar energy. One advantage is that more concentrated solar energy is more efficiently transformed to heat or electricity than less concentrated solar energy. Thermal and photovoltaic solar receivers operate more efficiently at higher incident solar energy levels. Another advantage is that non-concentrated solar energy receivers are, in some usage scenarios, more expensive than mirror systems used to concentrate sunlight. Thus, by building a system with mirrors, total cost of gathering sunlight over a given area and converting the gathered sunlight to useful energy is reduced. Concentrated solar energy collection systems, in some contexts, are divided into four types based on whether the solar energy is concentrated into a line-focus receiver or a point-focus receiver and whether the concentrators are single monolithic reflectors or multiple reflectors arranged as a Fresnel reflector to approximate a monolithic reflector. A line-focus receiver is a receiver with a target that is a relatively long straight line, like a pipe. A line-focus concentrator is a reflector (made up of a single smooth reflective surface, multiple fixed facets, or multiple movable Fresnel facets) that receives sunlight over a two dimensional space and concentrates the sunlight into a significantly smaller focal point in one dimension (width) while reflecting the sunlight without concentration in the other dimension (length) thus creating a focal line. A line-focus concentrator with a line-focus receiver at its focal line is a basic trough system. The concentrator is optionally rotated in one dimension around its focal line to track daily or seasonal (apparent) movement of the sun to improve total energy capture and conversion. A point-focus receiver is a receiver target that is essentially a point, but in various approaches is a panel, window, spot, ball, or other target shape, generally more equal in width and length than a line-focus receiver. A point-focus concentrator is a reflector (made up of a single smooth reflective surface, multiple fixed facets, or multiple movable Fresnel facets) that receives sunlight over a two-dimensional space and concentrates the sunlight into a significantly smaller focal point in two dimensions (width and length). A monolithic point-focus concentrator with a point-focus receiver at its focal point is a basic dish concentrated solar system. The monolithic concentrator is optionally rotated in two dimensions to rotate its focal axis around its focal point to track daily and seasonal movement of the sun to improve total energy capture and conversion. A parabolic trough system is a line concentrating system using a monolithic reflector shaped like a large half pipe having a shape defined by the equation y 2 =4fx where f is the focal length of the trough. The reflector has a 1-dimensional curvature to focus sunlight onto a line-focus receiver or approximates such curvature through multiple facets fixed relative to each other. A concentrating Fresnel reflector is a line concentrating system similar to the parabolic trough replacing the trough with a series of mirrors, each the length of a receiver, that are flat or alternatively slightly curved in width. Each mirror is individually rotated about its long axis to aim incident sunlight onto the line-focus receiver. A parabolic dish system is a point concentrating system using a monolithic reflector shaped like a bowl. The reflector has a 2-dimensional curvature to focus sunlight onto a point-focus receiver or approximates such curvature through multiple flat or alternatively curved facets fixed relative to each other. A solar power tower is a point concentrating system similar to the parabolic dish, replacing the dish with a 2-dimensional array of mirrors that are flat or alternatively curved. Each mirror (heliostat) is individually rotated in two dimensions to aim incident sunlight onto a point-focus receiver. The individual mirrors and an associated control system are parts of a point-focus concentrator with a focal axis that rotates around its focal point. In solar thermal systems, the receiver is a light to heat transducer. The receiver absorbs solar energy, transforming it to heat and transmitting the heat to a thermal transport medium such as water, steam, oil, or molten salt. The receiver converts solar energy to heat and minimizes and/or reduces heat loss due to thermal radiation. In concentrated photovoltaic systems, the receiver is a photovoltaic surface that directly generates electricity from sunlight. In some solar thermal systems, CPV and CST are combined in a single system where a thermal energy system generates thermal energy and acts as a heat sink for photovoltaic cells that operate more efficiently when cooled. Other receivers, such as a stirling engine, that use solar energy to generate heat and then locally convert the heat to electricity through mechanical motion and an electric generator, are also deployed as a receiver, in some approaches. In some concentrated solar systems, such as some systems with high concentration ratios, overall system is cost dominated by various elements such as the concentration system (such as a mirror or lens), a support system for the concentrators, and motors and mechanisms that enable tracking movement of the sun. The elements dominate the costs because the elements are enabled to withstand wind and weather. In some usage scenarios, solar energy systems are enabled to withstand various environmental dangers such as wind, rain, snow, ice, hail, dew, rodents, birds and other animals, dust, sand, moss, and other living organisms. Reflectivity of a concentrator is sensitive to damage, tarnishing, and dirt buildup since only directly reflected sunlight, not scattered sunlight, is effectively focused. Glass mirrors are used in some concentrated systems, because of an ability to maintain good optical properties over long design lives (e.g. 30 years) of concentrated solar systems. Glass is relatively fragile and vulnerable to hail and other forms of damage unless it is suitably thick, e.g. 4-5 mm for relatively larger mirrors. In a 400 square foot concentrating dish the thickness results in a weight of close to 1000 lbs or about nine kg per square meter of concentrator area. The mirror is formed in a precise curve, in one dimension for a trough, in two dimensions for a dish, to focus sunlight. In some concentrated systems, mirror surfaces cease to focus as intended if warped. Thus, the reflector is supported and held in shape by a metal superstructure that is shaped to the curved glass. The superstructure supports and protects the mirror from environmental conditions such as winds of 75 mph or more. The protection from winds adds an additional 10,000 lbs of load beyond the 1000 lb weight of the mirror, resulting in complex construction requiring roughly 20 kg of structural steel for every square meter of mirror area in a dish system. In some concentrated systems, concentrator tracking motors move the 30 kg per square meter weight of the concentrator, and also overcome force of wind that exceeds an additional 300 kg per square meter. The motors are exposed to environmental elements (such as, dirt, dust, moisture, etc). In some concentrated systems, troughs are spaced relatively far apart on (e.g. level) ground to avoid shading each other. Avoiding shading is important because the trough mirror is relatively expensive and so having any mirror shaded (and unproductive) is costly. Few approaches exceed ground coverage of 33% since that spacing avoids shading in winter (for an east/west orientation) or early/late in the day (for a north/south orientation). Some east/west orientations (e.g. with 33% ground coverage), have essentially no shading of any trough surface by another at any time during the day or year, capture almost all incident light within a trough array boundary during the winter (when the troughs are held vertical), but capture only about ⅓ of incident light within the trough array boundary during the summer (when the troughs are held horizontal). Troughs are placeable with length running north/south or east/west. If placed running north/south, then they are rotated during the day to track the daily movement of the sun and keep incident light focused on the receiver. In the morning, the trough is aimed to the east at the rising sun, at noon it is aimed up at the noonday sun, and in the evening it is aimed to the west at the setting sun. North/south troughs do not track seasonal variation in sun position. Instead, as the sun moves lower in the sky (toward the horizon of the equator) during the winter, light strikes the trough and reflects up the trough (away from the equator) to the receiver. In some instances, if troughs are oriented east/west, then they are rotated as the seasons progress to aim at the sun. During the summer the trough is held somewhat horizontal, aimed more or less straight up at the summer sun. During the winter the trough is held somewhat vertical, aimed toward the sun that is lower in the sky in the direction of the equator. In some instances, an east/west trough does not track the daily motion of the sun. Instead, when light comes from the east in the morning, it reflects off the trough and travels further west until it hits the receiver. Similarly, in the evening, the light hits the trough and travels further east down the trough until it hits the receiver.

In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques.

8950418,Fluid drainage system and methods,2013-04-16,1,1,"TECHNICAL BACKGROUND Fluid dispensation systems are used in a wide variety of applications and enterprises. They are used to irrigate farmland, water residential landscaping, distribute fertilizers, distribute fluids and chemicals for industrial processes, as well as a wide variety of other uses. Fluid dispensation systems typically include a plurality of fluid dispensation components including pipes, valves, sprinklers, control devices, backflow prevention devices, as well as other types of devices for controlling how a fluid is moved throughout the distribution system. Many fluid dispensation systems have branches or segments which operate in areas where there is little temperature control, no temperature control, or unexpected loss of temperature control due to power outage or other unexpected circumstances. The fluid dispensation system components which operate in these areas are often at risk of damage when freezing conditions occur. If the temperature in these areas drops below the freezing temperature of the fluid, expansive forces resulting from the freezing of the fluid within the fluid dispensation system may cause breaking, bursting, or cracking of the various components of the fluid dispensation system. In addition, other problems relating to unexpected or uncontrolled release of the fluid may result if the integrity of the fluid dispensation system is compromised. OVERVIEW In various embodiments, systems and methods are provided to operate a fluid drainage control system to drain a fluid from a fluid dispensation system. In an embodiment, a method for operating a fluid drainage control system to drain a fluid from a fluid dispensation system comprises determining a first ambient air temperature, determining if the first ambient air temperature is less than a predetermined drain set point temperature, isolating the fluid dispensation system from a fluid supply source by closing a supply valve located inside a temperature controlled area in response to the first ambient air temperature being less than the predetermined drain set point temperature, and draining the fluid from the fluid dispensation system. The fluid drainage control system then determines whether a second ambient air temperature is greater than a predetermined operation set point temperature, closes the drain valve in response to the second ambient air temperature being greater than the predetermined operation set point temperature, and opens the supply valve subsequent to closing the drain valve. In another embodiment, a fluid drainage control system for draining fluid from a fluid dispensation system comprises a temperature sensor, at least one supply valve, at least one drain valve, fluid dispensation pipe, a communication interface configured to receive and transmit control signals, and a processing system coupled to the communication interface. The processing system is further configured to receive a first control signal through the communication interface from the temperature sensor indicating a first ambient temperature, and determine if the first ambient air temperature is less than a predetermined drain set point temperature. When this condition occurs, the processing system isolates the fluid dispensation pipe from a fluid supply source by sending a second control signal through the communication interface to close the supply valve and drains the fluid from the fluid dispensation pipe by sending a third control signal through the communication interface to open the drain valve subsequent to sending the second control signal. The processing system is further configured to receive a fourth control signal from the temperature sensor through the communication interface indicating a second ambient temperature, determine a second ambient air temperature, and determine if the second ambient air temperature is greater than a predetermined operation set point temperature. If this condition exists, the processing system closes the drain valve in response to the second ambient air temperature being greater than the predetermined operation set point temperature by sending a fifth control signal through the communication interface. Finally, the processing system opens the supply valve by sending a sixth control signal through the communication interface subsequent to sending the fifth control signal. At this point, the fluid dispensation system has been returned to its initial state such that it can perform its primary fluid dispensation functions. In another example embodiment, the fluid dispensation system comprises a fluid backflow prevention device and at least one drain valve on the input side of the backflow prevention device and at least one drain valve on the output side of the backflow prevention device. When the fluid drainage control system opens a drain valve to protect the system from freezing conditions, it opens the drain valves on both the input and output sides of the backflow prevention device. In another example embodiment, the fluid drainage control system also has the ability to disable fluid distribution valves in the fluid dispensation system. The fluid distribution valves are disabled by the fluid drainage control system in response to the first ambient air temperature being less than the predetermined drain set point temperature. This precludes an irrigation control device from activating the fluid distribution valves on a normal schedule when the fluid distribution system is drained or otherwise not operational."
9027278,"Automated contamination-free seed sampler and methods of sampling, testing and bulking seeds",2013-09-20,1,1,"BACKGROUND The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art. In plant development and improvement, genetic improvements are made in the plant, either through selective breeding or genetic manipulation, and when a desirable improvement is achieved, a commercial quantity is developed by planting and harvesting seeds over several generations. Not all seeds express the desired traits, and thus these seeds need to be culled from the population. To speed up the process of bulking up the population, statistical samples are taken and tested to cull seeds from the population that do not adequately express the desired trait. However, this statistical sampling necessarily allows some seeds without the desirable trait to remain in the population, and also can inadvertently exclude some seeds with the desirable trait from the desired population. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,430 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,431 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,432 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,434 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,435 (filed Aug. 26, 2005), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, disclose apparatus and systems for the automated sampling of seeds as well as methods of sampling, testing and bulking seeds. However, at least some known automated sampling and testing systems allow for various types of contamination to taint collected samples and skew results. Therefore, there exists a need for the automated sampling of seeds in a substantially contamination-free manner. The present disclosure relates to systems and methods of non-destructively sampling material from seeds. The methods are particularly adapted for automation, which permits greater sampling than was previously practical. With automated, non-destructive sampling permitted by at least some of the embodiments of this disclosure, it is possible to test every seed in the population, and cull those seeds that do not express a desired trait. This greatly speeds up the process of bulking a given seed population, and can result in an improved final population. Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate the testing of most or all of the seeds in a population before planting, so that time and resources are not wasted in growing plants without the desired traits. Further, various embodiments allow for the automated sampling of seeds in a contamination-free manner, thereby substantially eliminating cross-over between samples. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated seed sampler system that includes a milling station for removing at least a portion of seed coat material from a seed and a sampling station for extracting a sample of seed material from the seed where the seed coat has been removed. A seed transport subsystem conveys the seed between the milling station and the sampling station and a seed deposit subsystem conveys the seed from the seed transport subsystem to a selected well in a seed tray after the seed has been sampled. In various other embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated seed sampler system that includes a milling station for removing at least a portion of seed coat material from a seed and a sampling station for extracting a sample of seed material from the seed where the seed coat has been removed. A sample collection and transport subsystem captures the extracted sample in a collection tube mounted on a collection tube placement device of the sample collection and transport subsystem. Additionally, a sample deposit subsystem conveys the sample from the sample collection and transport subsystem to a selected well in a sample tray. In yet other various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method of extracting sample material from a seed for testing. The method includes loading a seed in a seed holder of an automated seed sampler system and removing at least a portion of seed coat material from the seed at a milling station of the seed sampler system. A sample of seed material is then extracted from the seed where the seed coat has been removed at a sampling station of the seed sampler system. The sampled seed is then conveyed to a selected well in a seed tray using a seed deposit subsystem of the seed sampler system. The extracted sample is coincidentally conveyed to a selected well in a sample tray using a sample deposit subsystem of the seed sampler system. The deposited sample can then be tested for at least one desired seed characteristic. In still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated system for sequentially removing sample material from a plurality of seeds while leaving the viability of the seeds intact. The system includes a milling station for sequentially removing at least a portion of seed coat material from each seed and a sampling station for sequentially extracting a sample of seed material from each seed where the seed coat has been removed from the respective seed. A seed transport subsystem conveys the seeds between the milling station and the sampling station and a seed deposit subsystem sequentially conveys each seed from the seed transport subsystem to a selected one of a plurality of wells in a selected one of a plurality of seed trays. The system additionally includes a sample collection and transport subsystem for sequentially capturing the extracted sample of each seed in a corresponding collection tube mounted on one of a plurality of collection tube placement devices. The system further includes a sample deposit subsystem for sequentially conveying each sample from the sample collection and transport subsystem to a selected one of a plurality of wells in a selected one of a plurality of sample trays. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for removing tissue samples from seeds generally includes orienting seeds in a desired orientation, transporting the oriented seeds to a sampling station, and removing tissue samples from the oriented seeds at the sampling station. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, an automated method for removing a tissue sample from a seed generally includes isolating an individual seed from a plurality of seeds, orienting the isolated seed using an actuator, and removing a tissue sample from the oriented seed. Here, the actuator is configured to position the seed in a desired orientation. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for removing tissue samples from seeds generally includes orienting multiple seeds together in a seed transport and removing tissue samples from the oriented seeds while the oriented seeds are in the seed transport. The systems and methods of this disclosure facilitate the automated, non-destructive sampling of seeds in a substantially contamination-free manner. They permit the testing and sorting of large volumes of seeds, thereby facilitating the bulking up of seed populations with desirable traits. These and other features and advantages will be in part apparent, and in part pointed out hereinafter. Further areas of applicability of the present teachings will become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings."
9439367,Network enabled gardening with a remotely controllable positioning extension,2014-02-07,6,4,"FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY This disclosure relates generally to a horticultural system, and in one exemplary embodiment, to a system, method, and apparatus of network enabled gardening with a remotely controllable positioning extension. BACKGROUND A family may wish to grow vegetables and flowering plants inside and/or outside a home. For example, the family may create a garden of vegetables and flowering plants in their front yard and/or in a greenhouse area of their kitchen window. A family member (e.g., a child, a parent) may love gardening and flowers, and may prefer manually watering the garden because it may feel more natural, satisfying, and/or rewarding than through a timed irrigation system. Furthermore, the family member may prefer assessing temperature, sunshine, wind, and/other environmental conditions before deciding whether to manually water their garden. The family may travel on weekends often and may not be at home on a frequent basis. In addition, the family may lead busy schedules, governed by school, work, and/or family activities (e.g., miniature golf, after school art programs, choir, cherry picking, weekend getaways, Church). In addition, the family may remember to water their garden of vegetables when physically distant from the garden, for example, while at school, while on a weekend getaway, etc. However, because the garden may not be within an immediate proximity, the family may not be able to water the garden. Worse yet, the family may forget to water the garden after returning home. During these times, at least one member of the family may have a mobile device and/or Internet connectivity. However, there may not be anyone at the home where the garden is located to manually telephone in a request for watering. As a result, the garden of vegetables and flowering plants may not receive adequate water supply and/or beneficial fertilizers regularly. As such, fewer flowers and vegetables may grow in the garden than would otherwise if the garden were to receive adequate water and nutrients. A watering apparatus and associated methods and systems to enable networked gardening with a remotely controllable positioning extension are disclosed. In one aspect, the watering apparatus includes a weather-resistant housing to encompass a micro-processor and a communications circuitry. In addition, the watering apparatus includes a weather-resistant camera communicatively coupled with the weather resistant housing through the communications circuitry. An input connector directs water through a partitioned channel from the weather-resistant housing responsive to a signal from the microprocessor through a pressure regulated valve. The watering apparatus is connected to a flexible extension coupled with the weather-resistant housing to automatically transport the water directed through the partitioned channel to a desired location within a central view of a focused angle of the weather-resistant camera. The watering apparatus may wirelessly register a public and/or private Internet Protocol (IP) address with a local access point of a network through the communications circuitry. Further, the watering apparatus may be accessed through a mobile device through a network based on an access control policy configured by a user of the watering apparatus. The watering apparatus may also communicate a visual data of the weather-resistant camera including the focused angle and/or the central view to the mobile device through the network. The weather-resistant camera may be repositioned based on a reposition data received from the mobile device through the network when a haptic gesture is applied on a touchscreen of the mobile device. The watering apparatus may activate the water at a communicated pressure through the partitioned channel using the pressure regulated valve based on a trigger data received from the mobile device through the network. The watering apparatus may deactivate the water through the partitioned channel using the pressure regulated valve based on a stop data received from the mobile device through the network. Further, the watering apparatus may include a rainfall sensor in the weather-resistant housing to communicate an amount of rainfall detected by the watering apparatus to the mobile device through the network. The watering apparatus may also include a humidity sensor in the weather-resistant housing to communicate a relative humidity detected by the watering apparatus to the mobile device through the network. In addition, the watering apparatus may include a temperature sensor in the weather-resistant housing to communicate a temperature data to the mobile device through the network. Further, the watering apparatus may comprise a solar panel affixed on the upper surface of the watering apparatus to power circuitry in the weather-resistant housing.

10197766,Concentrating solar power with glasshouses,2014-05-01,1,3,"BACKGROUND Field Advancements in concentrated solar thermal power (CST), photovoltaic solar energy (PV), concentrated photovoltaic solar energy (CPV), and industrial use of concentrated solar thermal energy are needed to provide improvements in performance, efficiency, and utility of use. Related Art Unless expressly identified as being publicly or well known, mention herein of techniques and concepts, including for context, definitions, or comparison purposes, should not be construed as an admission that such techniques and concepts are previously publicly known or otherwise part of the prior art. AU references cited herein (if any), including patents, patent applications, and publications, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, whether specifically incorporated or not, for all purposes. Concentrated solar power systems use mirrors, known as concentrators, to gather solar energy over a large space and aim and focus the energy at receivers that convert incoming solar energy to another form, such as heat or electricity. There are several advantages, in some usage scenarios, to concentrated systems over simpler systems that directly use incident solar energy One advantage is that more concentrated solar energy is more efficiently transformed to heat or electricity than less concentrated solar energy. Thermal and photovoltaic solar receivers operate more efficiently at higher incident solar energy levels Another advantage is that non-concentrated solar energy receivers are, in some usage scenarios, more expensive than mirror systems used to concentrate sunlight. Thus, by building a system with mirrors, total cost of gathering sunlight over a given area and converting the gathered sunlight to useful energy is reduced. Concentrated solar energy collection systems, in some contexts, are divided into four types based on whether the solar energy is concentrated into a line-focus receiver or a point-focus receiver and whether the concentrators are single monolithic reflectors or multiple reflectors arranged as a Fresnel reflector to approximate a monolithic reflector. A line-focus receiver is a receiver with a target that is a relatively long straight line, like a pipe. A line-focus concentrator is a reflector that receives sunlight over a two dimensional space and concentrates the sunlight into a significantly smaller focal point in one dimension (width) while reflecting the sunlight without concentration in the other dimension (length) thus creating a focal line. A line-focus concentrator with a line-focus receiver at its focal line is a basic trough system. The concentrator is optionally rotated in one dimension around its focal line to track daily movement of the sun to improve total energy capture and conversion. A point-focus receiver is a receiver target that is essentially a point, but in various approaches is a panel, window, spot, ball, or other target shape, generally more equal in width and length than a line-focus receiver. A point-focus concentrator is a reflector (made up of a single smooth reflective surface, multiple fixed facets, or multiple movable Fresnel facets) that receives sunlight over a two-dimensional space and concentrates the sunlight into a significantly smaller focal point in two dimensions (width and length). A monolithic point-focus concentrator with a point-focus receiver at its focal point is a basic dish concentrated solar system. The monolithic concentrator is optionally rotated in two dimensions to rotate its focal axis around its focal point to track daily and seasonal movement of the sun to improve total energy capture and conversion. A parabolic trough system is a line concentrating system using a monolithic reflector shaped like a large half pipe. The reflector has a 1-dimensional curvature to focus sunlight onto a line-focus receiver or approximates such curvature through multiple facets fixed relative to each other. A concentrating Fresnel reflector is a line concentrating system similar to the parabolic trough replacing the trough with a series of mirrors, each the length of a receiver, that are flat or alternatively slightly curved in their width. Each mirror is individually rotated about its long axis to aim incident sunlight onto the line-focus receiver. A parabolic dish system is a point concentrating system using a monolithic reflector shaped like a bowl. The reflector has a 2-dimensional curvature to focus sunlight onto a point-focus receiver or approximates such curvature through multiple flat or alternatively curved facets fixed relative to each other. A solar power tower is a point concentrating system similar to the parabolic dish, replacing the dish with a 2-dimensional array of mirrors that are flat or alternatively curved. Each mirror (heliostat) is individually rotated in two dimensions to aim incident sunlight onto a point-focus receiver. The individual mirrors and an associated control system comprise a point-focus concentrator whose focal axis rotates around its focal point. In solar thermal systems, the receiver is a light to heat transducer. The receiver absorbs solar energy, transforming it to heat and transmitting the heat to a thermal transport medium such as water, steam, oil, or molten salt. The receiver converts solar energy to heat and minimizes and/or reduces heat loss due to thermal radiation. In concentrated photovoltaic systems, the receiver is a photovoltaic surface that directly generates electricity from sunlight. In some solar thermal systems, CPV and CST are combined in a single system where a thermal energy system generates thermal energy and acts as a heat sink for photovoltaic cells that operate more efficiently when cooled. Other receivers, such as a Stirling engine, that use solar energy to generate heat and then locally convert the heat to electricity through mechanical motion and an electric generator, are also deployed as a receiver, in some approaches. In some concentrated solar systems, such as some systems with high concentration ratios, overall system is cost dominated by various elements such as the concentration system (such as a mirror or lens), a support system for the concentrators, and motors and mechanisms that enable tracking movement of the sun. The elements dominate the costs because the elements are enabled to withstand wind and weather. In some usage scenarios, solar energy systems are enabled to withstand various environmental dangers such as wind, rain, snow, ice, hail, dew, rodents, birds and other animals, dust, sand, moss, and other living organisms. Reflectivity of a concentrator is sensitive to damage, tarnishing, and dirt buildup since only directly reflected sunlight, not scattered sunlight, is effectively focused. Glass mirrors are used in some concentrated systems, because of an ability to maintain good optical properties over long design lives (e.g. 30 years) of concentrated solar systems. Glass is relatively fragile and vulnerable to hail and other forms of damage unless it is suitably thick, e.g. 4-5 mm for relatively larger mirrors. In a 400 square foot concentrating dish the thickness results in a weight of close to 1000 lbs or about nine kg per meter of concentrator area. The mirror is formed in a precise curve, in one dimension for a trough, in two dimensions for a dish, to focus sunlight. In some concentrated systems, mirror surfaces cease to focus as intended if warped. Thus, the reflector is supported and held in shape by a metal superstructure that is shaped to the curved glass. The superstructure supports and protects the mirror from environmental conditions such as winds of 75 mph or more. The winds add an additional 10,000 lbs of load beyond the 1000 lb weight of the mirror, resulting in complex construction requiring roughly 20 kg of structural steel for every meter of mirror area in a dish system. In some concentrated systems, concentrator tracking motors move the 30 kg per square meter weight of the concentrator, and also overcome force of wind that exceeds an additional 300 kg per sq meter. The motors are exposed to environmental elements (such as, dirt, dust, moisture, etc). In some CST systems, parabolic dishes with point-focus receivers are not used, at least in part because structural demands on the dish are prohibitive and designing a tracking mechanism that keeps the focal point fixed (to avoid complex and expensive mechanisms to connect the thermal medium system) is impractical. The invention may be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an article of manufacture, an apparatus, a system, and a composition of matter. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. The Detailed Description provides an exposition of one or more embodiments of the invention that enable improvements in performance, efficiency, and utility of use in the field identified above. The Detailed Description includes an Introduction to facilitate the more rapid understanding of the remainder of the Detailed Description. As is discussed in more detail in the Conclusions, the invention encompasses all possible modifications and variations within the scope of the issued claims."
10058042,Integrated control circuitry and coil assembly for irrigation control,2014-09-22,1,1,"1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to irrigation control devices and more specifically to multi-wire irrigation control systems including remote devices coupled to a multi-wire path and for coupling to actuator coil-controlled irrigation equipment. 2. Discussion of the Related Art In decoder-based irrigation control systems, an irrigation controller sends signaling along a wire path to which one or more decoder devices are attached. Each decoder device monitors transmissions on the wire path and decodes this signaling to determine when to cause irrigation devices coupled thereto to be activated and deactivated. The decoder module typically includes circuitry formed on a printed circuit board located within a housing. Wiring from the decoder module housing must be coupled to the wiring of the wire path as well as coupled to one or more actuator devices each controlling the opening and closing of an irrigation rotor or valve. In one form, the rotor or valve is operated by a solenoid coil as is well known in the art. Likewise, during installation, the operator must provide and electrically connect two separate devices, a decoder module and an actuator coil module, to each other and to the control wire path. FIG. 1 illustrates a separate decoder module 102 and a coil unit 104 that are conventionally coupled together. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 2 , for a solenoid activated rotor assembly 200 , the coil module 104 is coupled (in part by a bracket 212 and retainer 214 ) to the parts of a selector valve assembly 202 (including a pressure regulator) attached to a casing assembly 204 . The electrical wire inputs to the coil module 104 are then connected to the electrical wire outputs from the decoder module 102 , while the electrical wire inputs to the decoder module 102 are coupled to the control wire path from the irrigation controller. Thus, a typical installation requires the connection of six wires to install the decoder module 102 and a coil module 104 . As is well known, in operation, a portion of a plunger (not shown) of the selector valve assembly 202 is disposed within the coil unit 104 while another portion is seated against a solenoid plunge port (not shown) within the selector valve assembly 202 in a normally closed position. In this position, high pressure water flow from a main water control valve (not shown) located within a main control valve portion 206 of the device is flowed up high pressure water line 208 into the selector valve assembly 202 and its regulator and is prevented from further movement by the normally closed position of the plunger against the solenoid port in the selector valve assembly 202 . This results in a back pressure that causes the main water control valve to close. In response to signals from the decoder module 102 , the coil module 104 causes the actuation of the plunger to move it off of (or unseat from) the solenoid plunge port allowing the high pressure flow in the high pressure line 208 to flow through the selector valve assembly 202 (and its pressure regulator), which relieves the back pressure and allows water to flow through the main control valve and to a pop-up sprinkler device, i.e., the main water control valve is opened. The pop-up sprinkler device is located within the casing assembly 204 and extends upwardly due to the water pressure through a top portion of the casing assembly 204 . The high pressure flow exits the selector valve assembly 202 down through a discharge flow line 210 which terminates within the casing assembly 204 at a location downstream of the main water control valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Several embodiments of the invention provide an integrated valve actuator coil and control module for use in irrigation control systems. In one embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry to receive control signals from an irrigation control unit and electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a housing covers at least a portion of both the coil and the control circuitry, the housing including a threaded end configured to thread the irrigation control device to a valve assembly to be actuated by the electromagnetic flux of the coil. In another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: An irrigation control device, comprising: a bobbin with two opposing radially extending flanges; a coil mounted on the bobbin between the flanges, the coil being adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of irrigation equipment; control circuitry with a circuit board electrically coupled to the coil to control the flux at the coil; and a spacer disposed between the coil and the circuit board, the spacer having a main member including: a first concave surface facing the coil and forming a recess for receiving the coil, a second surface opposite the first surface; stands extending from the second surface and to the circuit board to space the coil away from the circuit board, and a retaining portion extending between the flanges of the bobbin. In yet another embodiment, the invention can be characterized as an irrigation control device comprising: a solenoid assembly having a coil and a plunger, the coil adapted to develop an electromagnetic flux sufficient to cause actuation of the plunger to control an irrigation valve; control circuitry with a circuit board and electrically coupled to the coil, the control circuitry adapted to receive control signals and operational power from an irrigation control unit and adapted to control the electromagnetic flux at the coil; and a housing covering both the solenoid assembly and the control circuitry."
9883640,Methods and apparatus for transporting elastomeric emitters and/or manufacturing drip lines,2014-10-20,1,1,"The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for transporting or delivering elastomeric emitters and inserting elastomeric emitters into drip line, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for manufacturing drip line to form an irrigation assembly or system. BACKGROUND Irrigation drip emitters are commonly used in irrigation systems to convert fluid flowing through a supply tube or drip line at a relatively high flow rate to a relatively low flow rate at the outlet of each emitter. Such emitters are typically used in landscaping (both residential and commercial) to water and/or treat (e.g., fertilize) trees, shrubs, flowers, grass and other vegetation, and in agricultural applications to water and/or treat crops. Typically, multiple drip emitters are positioned on the inside or outside of a water supply line or tube at predetermined intervals to distribute water and/or other fluids at precise points to surrounding land and vegetation. The emitter normally includes a pressure reducing passageway, such as a zigzag labyrinth or passage, which reduces high pressure fluid entering the drip emitter into relatively low pressure fluid exiting the drip emitter. Generally, such drip emitters are formed in one of three common manners: (1) separate structures connected to a supply tube either internally (i.e., in-line emitters) or externally (i.e., on-line emitters or branch emitters); (2) drip strips or tape either connected to an inner surface of a supply tube or in-between ends of a material to form a generally round supply tube or conduit; and (3) stamped into a surface of a material that is then folded over upon itself or that overlaps itself to form a drip line with an enclosed emitter. With respect to the first type of common drip emitter, the emitter is constructed of a separate housing that is attached to the drip line. The housing is normally a multi-piece structure that when assembled defines the pressure reducing flow path that the fluid travels through to reduce its pressure. Some examples of in-line emitters that are bonded to an inner surface of the supply line or tube are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 7,648,085 issued Jan. 19, 2010 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0282873, published Nov. 11, 2010, and some examples of on-line emitters which are connected to an exterior surface of the supply line or tube (usually by way of puncture via a barbed end) are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,029 issued Oct. 13, 1998. Some advantages to in-line emitters are that the emitter units are less susceptible to being knocked loose from the fluid carrying conduit and the conduit can be buried underground if desired (i.e., subsurface emitters) which further makes it difficult for the emitter to be inadvertently damaged (e.g., by way of being hit or kicked by a person, hit by a lawnmower or trimmer, etc.). With respect to the second type of emitter, (i.e., drip strips or tape), the emitter is typically formed at predetermined intervals along a long stretch of material which is either bonded to the inner surface of the supply line or connected between ends of a material to form a generally round conduit or supply line with the strip or tape running the longitudinal length of the conduit. Some examples of drip strips or tape type emitters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,520 issued Feb. 23, 1988. With respect to the third type of emitter, (i.e., folded or overlapping tube emitters), the emitter is typically formed by stamping a pressure reducing flow path on one surface of a tube making material at or near an end thereof which is then folded back over on itself or which is wrapped such that the opposite end of the tube making material overlaps the end with the stamped flow path to form an enclosed pressure-reducing passageway. Some examples of folded or overlapping tube emitters are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,520 issued Feb. 23, 1988, and International Patent Application Publication No. WO00/01219 published Jan. 13, 2000. In addition, many if not all of the above mentioned emitters can be manufactured with a pressure compensating mechanism that allows the emitters to adjust or compensate for fluctuations in the fluid pressure within the supply line. For example, some of the above emitters include separate elastomeric diaphragms which are positioned adjacent the pressure reducing passageway and help reduce the cross-section of the passageway when an increase in supply line fluid pressure occurs and increase the cross-section of the passageway when a decrease in the supply line fluid pressure occurs. While each of these forms of emitters has its own advantage, they each require either multiple pieces to be assembled, aligned and carefully bonded to the supply line or intricate stamping and folding or overlapping to be performed in order to manufacture the emitter and ensure that the emitter operates as desired. Thus, these emitters often require more time and care to assemble which needlessly can slow down the production of the drip line and/or emitter and can increase the cost of the drip line and/or emitter as well. Thus, there is a need for a simpler emitter construction that can be manufactured faster and using fewer parts and without wasting as much time, energy and materials related to aligning and assembling multiple parts of the emitter and/or folding or overlapping materials. In addition, some of the above-mentioned emitters introduce structures (sometimes even the entire emitter body) into the main lumen of the supply line or tube which can cause turbulence and result in later emitters or emitters further downstream not working as well or efficiently as earlier emitters or upstream emitters. For example, in some of the non-pressure compensated emitters the introduction of too much turbulence from emitter structures located upstream can reduce the pressure of the fluid further downstream and result in the downstream emitters trickling water at a different flow rate than upstream emitters. This is not normally desirable as in most applications it would be desirable that the emitters of the drip line saturate their respective surrounding area at a common flow rate rather than having one portion of the drip line saturate one area more than another portion of the drip line saturates another area. In other in-line emitters, large cylindrical structures are used which interfere with the flow of the fluid traveling through the drip line or tube and introduce more turbulence to the fluid or system due to the fact they cover and extend inward from the entire inner surface of the drip line or tube. The increased mass of the cylindrical unit and the fact it extends about the entire inner surface of the drip line or tube also increases the likelihood that the emitter will get clogged with grit or other particulates (which are more typically present at the wall portion of the tube or line than in the middle of the tube or line) and/or that the emitter itself will form a surface upon which grit or particulates can build-up on inside the drip line and slow the flow of fluid through the drip line or reduce the efficiency of the fluid flowing therethrough. Thus, there is also a need to reduce the size of in-line emitters and improve the efficiency of the systems within which these items are mounted. New forms of emitters have been designed to overcome many of these problems and are disclosed in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20130248616, published Sep. 26, 2013 and International Patent Application Publication No. WO2013148672, published Oct. 3, 2013. These emitters are made of a elastomeric body that integrally defines an inlet for receiving pressurized fluid from a fluid supply source, an outlet area for discharging the fluid from the elastomeric emitter body, a pressure reducing flow path extending between the inlet and the outlet for reducing the pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet and discharged through the outlet area, and a pressure compensating portion for automatically adjusting the pressure and flow reducing effect of the flow channel in response to a change in pressure of the fluid supply source. While such an emitter overcomes the problems discussed above, the elastomeric material that makes-up the emitter can make it difficult to transport and insert the emitter into drip line or tubing using conventional insertion equipment due to the higher coefficient of friction that exists between the elastomeric material and the insertion equipment or tooling used to insert the emitter body into drip line tubing. Accordingly, it has been determined that a need exists for new methods and apparatus for transporting or delivering elastomeric emitters and inserting elastomeric emitters into drip line, and more particularly, to new methods and apparatus for manufacturing drip line to form an irrigation assembly or system that overcome the aforementioned limitations and which further provide capabilities, features and functions, not available in current methods and apparatus relating to the manufacture of drip lines or emitters."
9752766,Air cooled horticulture lighting fixture,2015-03-19,3,4,"Technical Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to horticulture light fixtures for growing plants indoors, and particularly to an air cooled fixture used in confined indoor growing spaces that burns a double ended high pressure sodium lamp. Description of Related and Prior Art Horticulture light fixtures used for growing plants in confined indoor spaces must provide adequate light to grow plants, while not excessively raising the temperature of the growing environment. Removal of the heat generated by the fixture is commonly achieved by forcing cooling air around the lamp and through the fixture, exhausting the same out of the growing environment. The air used for cooling the fixture is not mixed with the growing atmosphere, as the growing atmosphere is specially controlled and often enhanced with Carbon Dioxide to aid in plant development and health. Innovations in electronic ballast technology made feasible for use in the indoor garden industry an improved high pressure sodium ‘HPS’ grow lamp that is connected to power at each end of the lamp, thus the term “Double Ended”. The double ended lamp as powered from each end is also supported by sockets at each end, thereby eliminating the need for a frame support wire inside the lamp as required in standard single ended HPS lamps. The absence of frame wire eliminates shadows that commonly plague single ended HPS lamps. The double ended lamp further benefits from a smaller arc tube that is gas filled rather than vacuum encapsulated. The smaller arc tube equates to a smaller point source of light, thereby improving light projection control and photometric performance. The double ended HPS lamp proves to be more efficient than its single ended HPS lamp equivalent, last longer than like wattage HPS lamps, and produces more light in beneficial wavelength for growing plants than any single ended HPS lamps of the same light output rating. The double ended HPS lamp, with all of its light output performance advantages, has a significant particularity in operation, specifically when cooling the lamp. Operating temperatures at the lamp envelope surface must be maintained within a narrow operating range else the double ended HPS lamp's efficiencies in electrical power conversion into light energy are significantly reduced. When impacted by moving air, the double ended HPS lamp draws excessive electrical current which may cause failure or shutdown of the ballast powering the lamp. When bounded by stagnant air held at constant operating temperature the double ended HPS lamp proves more efficient in converting electricity to light energy and produces more light in the plant usable spectrum. This particularity in the double ended HPS lamp makes it an excellent grow lamp, but also thwarted earlier attempts to enclose, seal, and air cool the double ended HPS lamp to be used in confined indoor growing application due to the lamp's substantial sensitivity to moving cooling air. Another challenges not resolved by the prior art involves sealing the glass sheet to the bottom of the fixture. The reflector interior temperatures when burning a double ended HPS lamp cause failures of gasket materials. Further, the ultraviolet and infrared light energies produced by the double ended HPS lamp degrade and make brittle rubber, neoprene, and most other gasket materials suitable for sealing the glass sheet. Gavita, a lighting company from Holland produces various fixtures utilizing the double ended HPS lamp. The usual configuration includes a reflector with a spine, the spine having a socket on each opposing end such that the double ended lamp is suspended under a reflector over the plants. The reflector is not sealed from the growing environment, nor is there a housing enclosure or ducts to facilitate forced air cooling. The Gavita fixtures provide the benefit of the high performing double ended HPS lamp, but lacks air cooling capability which is necessary in many indoor growing applications as discussed above. Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that the prior art does not teach nor suggest an air cooled horticulture fixture for a double ended HPS lamp suitable for growing plants in confined indoor growing spaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing, one object of the present invention is to provide an air cooled double ended HPS lamp fixture for growing plants in confined indoor environments. A further object of this invention is to provide a fixture construct wherein the excessive heat generated by the lamp is removed using a stream of forced air. It is another object of the present invention to provide a stagnant air space around the lamp that is maintained at constant temperatures within the reflector during operation to prevent the lamp from drawing excessive current when subjected to temperatures differentials, or direct moving cooling air Another object of the present invention is to provide a positive air tight seal between the fixture and the growing environment using a gasket that is protected from the lamp's damaging light. This invention further features turbulence enhancement of the cooling air stream by a diverter that disrupts the air stream creating eddies over the top of the reflector. Other objects, advantages, and features of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when contemplated with the accompanying drawings."

9383291,"Automated contamination-free seed sampler and methods of sampling, testing and bulking seeds",2015-04-13,2,1,"This disclosure relates to systems and methods for taking samples from biological materials such as seeds. BACKGROUND The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art. In plant development and improvement, genetic improvements are made in the plant, either through selective breeding or genetic manipulation, and when a desirable improvement is achieved, a commercial quantity is developed by planting and harvesting seeds over several generations. Not all seeds express the desired traits, and thus these seeds need to be culled from the population. To speed up the process of bulking up the population, statistical samples are taken and tested to cull seeds from the population that do not adequately express the desired trait. However, this statistical sampling necessarily allows some seeds without the desirable trait to remain in the population, and also can inadvertently exclude some seeds with the desirable trait from the desired population. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,430 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/213,431 (filed Aug. 26, 2005); U.S. patent application Ser.

However, at least some known automated sampling and testing systems allow for various types of contamination to taint collected samples and skew results. Therefore, there exists a need for the automated sampling of seeds in a substantially contamination-free manner. The present disclosure relates to systems and methods of non-destructively sampling material from seeds. The methods are particularly adapted for automation, which permits greater sampling than was previously practical. With automated, non-destructive sampling permitted by at least some of the embodiments of this disclosure, it is possible to test every seed in the population, and cull those seeds that do not express a desired trait. This greatly speeds up the process of bulking a given seed population, and can result in an improved final population. Various embodiments of the present disclosure facilitate the testing of most or all of the seeds in a population before planting, so that time and resources are not wasted in growing plants without the desired traits. Further, various embodiments allow for the automated sampling of seeds in a contamination-free manner, thereby substantially eliminating cross-over between samples. In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated seed sampler system that includes a milling station for removing at least a portion of seed coat material from a seed and a sampling station for extracting a sample of seed material from the seed where the seed coat has been removed. A seed transport subsystem conveys the seed between the milling station and the sampling station and a seed deposit subsystem conveys the seed from the seed transport subsystem to a selected well in a seed tray after the seed has been sampled. In various other embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated seed sampler system that includes a milling station for removing at least a portion of seed coat material from a seed and a sampling station for extracting a sample of seed material from the seed where the seed coat has been removed. A sample collection and transport subsystem captures the extracted sample in a collection tube mounted on a collection tube placement device of the sample collection and transport subsystem. Additionally, a sample deposit subsystem conveys the sample from the sample collection and transport subsystem to a selected well in a sample tray. In yet other various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a method of extracting sample material from a seed for testing. The method includes loading a seed in a seed holder of an automated seed sampler system and removing at least a portion of seed coat material from the seed at a milling station of the seed sampler system. A sample of seed material is then extracted from the seed where the seed coat has been removed at a sampling station of the seed sampler system. The sampled seed is then conveyed to a selected well in a seed tray using a seed deposit subsystem of the seed sampler system. The extracted sample is coincidentally conveyed to a selected well in a sample tray using a sample deposit subsystem of the seed sampler system. The deposited sample can then be tested for at least one desired seed characteristic. In still other embodiments, the present disclosure provides an automated system for sequentially removing sample material from a plurality of seeds while leaving the viability of the seeds intact. The system includes a milling station for sequentially removing at least a portion of seed coat material from each seed and a sampling station for sequentially extracting a sample of seed material from each seed where the seed coat has been removed from the respective seed. A seed transport subsystem conveys the seeds between the milling station and the sampling station and a seed deposit subsystem sequentially conveys each seed from the seed transport subsystem to a selected one of a plurality of wells in a selected one of a plurality of seed trays. The system additionally includes a sample collection and transport subsystem for sequentially capturing the extracted sample of each seed in a corresponding collection tube mounted on one of a plurality of collection tube placement devices. The system further includes a sample deposit subsystem for sequentially conveying each sample from the sample collection and transport subsystem to a selected one of a plurality of wells in a selected one of a plurality of sample trays. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for removing tissue samples from seeds generally includes orienting seeds in a desired orientation, transporting the oriented seeds to a sampling station, and removing tissue samples from the oriented seeds at the sampling station. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, an automated method for removing a tissue sample from a seed generally includes isolating an individual seed from a plurality of seeds, orienting the isolated seed using an actuator, and removing a tissue sample from the oriented seed. Here, the actuator is configured to position the seed in a desired orientation. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, a method for removing tissue samples from seeds generally includes orienting multiple seeds together in a seed transport and removing tissue samples from the oriented seeds while the oriented seeds are in the seed transport. The systems and methods of this disclosure facilitate the automated, non-destructive sampling of seeds in a substantially contamination-free manner. They permit the testing and sorting of large volumes of seeds, thereby facilitating the bulking up of seed populations with desirable traits. These and other features and advantages will be in part apparent, and in part pointed out hereinafter. Further areas of applicability of the present teachings will become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings."
9615657,Corner joint for modular portable stand,2015-06-25,1,1,"TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of stands, and specifically to stands used for indoor gardening or aquatics that require no tools or additional hardware when assembling or disassembling. The present invention relates to knock-down portable stands, such as used to support heavy items at level elevations, and the invention aims to provide a portable stand of modular construction that easily assembles and disassembles without the need for tools and without requiring fasteners or hardware of any type. Indoor gardeners utilize trays for starting, propagating, and growing plants. Ebb & flow or drip system gardeners often load a tray with plants, growing media, and water, which in aggregate can become too heavy for the common card table or plastic fold out table to support. Leaving the tray on the ground is not a good option as the standard placement of the water reservoir is directly below the tray. Having the tray elevated for easier plant tending is further desired to make the growing process more enjoyable for the user, and accessible for the disabled grower. A stand used for growing plants that supports a propagation tray must maintain the tray at a level elevation to facilitate complete draining of water and nutrient solutions from the growing media and tray. As the bottom of the tray must be level to the ground in order to optimize ebb and flow gardening practice, the stand that holds the tray must be sturdy enough to prevent the tray from flexing or tilting, keeping the tray level and undistorted. Like a stand used in propagation of plants, a stand used for fish tank support must also maintain a level elevation, and be strong enough to hold the weight of an aquarium, full of water, fish, and rock, with over head lights, pumps, and other components necessary for indoor aquatic practice located either above, below, or on the stand. As the nature of aquatics and growing plants includes the presence of water, the stand must not only be strong and rigid when assembled, but also resistant to water damage, and will not fail if occasionally soaked or saturated, which makes stands constructed of wood or wood composite materials undesirable. A stand that is easy to assemble and disassemble, with the benefit of breaking it down simply to fit into a compact storage area is greatly desired. With the disabled user in mind, the assembly and disassembly process should be easy to understand with no small fasteners or hardware that would be difficult to secure with arthritis or joint pain. Ideally, no tools or hardware would be required. A recent answer to the ‘stand’ problem presented has been products similar to the “Gorilla Tray Stand” that require fixating a plurality of small threaded fasteners to assemble or disassemble. The structure of the stand itself holds the tray level to the ground, is rigid, and allows for easy moving. However, the short comings of this tray stand is the complicated assembly instructions, difficult to fasten bolts and screws, difficult disassembly, all requiring the use of specialized tools. Hence, it can be seen in the indoor gardening and indoor aquatics industry, especially for ebb and flow or drip gardening practices, that there is a need for an improved modular stand, capable of securing a propagation tray or fish tank such that it remains level and elevated to the ground, provides space under the tray or tank for a reservoir or the like, allows accessibility from all sides, is mobile, and easily assembled and disassembled. Further, other fields of art also benefit from a stand that is versatile in application and robust in design as described herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The stand assembles easily without tools, additional hardware, or complicated instructions. In the preferred modular embodiment, the stand has four frame rails with each opposing frame rail having identical construction. At each corner there is a leg that facilitates the interlocking of the frame rails without fasteners, each able to receive a wheel or caster on the ground end. The entire stand disassembles by pulling up on each side rail and removing the legs, allowing the stand to quickly break down. The components are long and flat allowing for compact storage or easy packing for travel or transport. The stand can support great weights, and with the addition of cross supports, the loading capacities can be significantly increased. The cross supports fixate either on the top of the frame when used as a table top, or on the bottom of the frame when used to support a fish tank or propagation tray. When used as a propagation tray stand the device provides 360 degree access to items supported on or within the stand and items located below the stand. In the disclosed embodiment described herein, the stand is of just one specific application as a mobile plant tray stand for growing plants, whereby the plant tray fittingly inserts from the top and rests on the frame and within the stand, while a reservoir is located below to facilitate ebb and flow type gardening practice. One skilled in the art will quickly realize that many other uses and applications are readily available for the stand, including but not in any way limited to a quick to assemble table, fish tank stand, marketing display, or moving dolly. OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described herein so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art: 1. Versatile in application 2. Robust in construction 3. Only eight components: four frame rails and four legs 4. Only three unique components: base frame, side frame, and leg 5. Optional cross bars easily attach sides for increasing loading capacity 6. Interlocking at the corners provides a rigid and sturdy stand 7. Rigidity and strength increase with added load 8. Movable with inclusion of wheels at the bottom of each of the four legs 9. No tools or special equipment needed to assemble/disassemble 10. Simple to understand assemble/disassemble instructions 11. Fast assembly/disassembly 12. Stores in compact spaces when disassembled 13. Easily transportable when disassembled 14. No hardware"
9497905,Grow light systems and methods for controlling the same,2015-08-06,1,1,"This patent specification relates to grow light systems and methods for controlling the same. More particularly, this patent specification relates to integrated lamp and LED light systems and the control thereof for maximizing grow potential of plant matter. BACKGROUND Plants such as trees, crops, bushes, and other matter the use photosynthesis have evolved to grow in response to natural light provided by the sun. When plants are grown indoors or other location that inhibits access to natural light, the growing potential is hampered. Artificial light has been used to grow plants, but in order to achieve, at best, marginal results, these attempts require a substantial amount of energy and produce high quantities of heat. What is needed is a system that minimizes energy requirements, eliminates excessive heat, and produces an energy signature highly conducive to plant growth. Grow light systems and methods for controlling the systems are described herein. The grow light system can include an integrated lamp and light emitting diodes (LEDs) structure that produces an energy signature highly conducive to plant growth, and that uses minimal energy. A further understanding of the nature and advantages of the embodiments discussed herein may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings."
9901245,Selectively bendable remote gripping tool,2015-08-10,2,1,"The present invention is directed to a selectively bendable remote access gripping tool that includes a jaw portion having a pair of jaws or nets movable relative to each other between clamped and opened positions thereof, a handle portion spaced apart from the jaw portion by a bendable central portion that has a hollow, corrugated member that is bendable, and a cord extending through the hollow bendable member that connects the jaw portion and the handle portion. Hand-held gripping devices for picking up and gripping objects have been known for years and typically employ a jaw portion and a handle portion spaced apart by a central portion. Such “grippers”, “reachers” and “grapsers” typically have fixed-length central portions, although some have two part construction that permits a pivot point around the central portion of the device so that it can be stored more easily, and still others have telescoping portions to facilitate adjustable-length central portions. In other related fields, such as surgery, dentistry and orthodontia, professionals often have a desire to reach interior portions of a person's anatomy to grasp objects, tissue, etc. Many prior art devices to achieve such objectives are linear with grasping jaws, while still others have a flexible portion that facilitates some angular adjustments. Such tools, however, are often complicated in terms of construction, often employing rails and jointed connections that rotate relative to each other to facilitate desired flexibility of the tool along at least an extent thereof. A simpler, cost effective, light weight and versatile tool is therefore desired that can facilitate such professional's procedures involving reaching into interior portions of a person's anatomy to grasp objects, tissue, etc. Ischemic strokes can be caused by clots within a cerebral artery. The clots block blood flow, and the blocked blood flow can deprive brain tissue of its blood supply. The clots can be a thrombus that forms locally or an embolus that migrated from another location to the place of vessel obstruction. To reduce the effects of the cut off in blood supply to the tissue, time is an important factor. As stroke physicians say: “time is brain.” In particular, it is desirable to restore blood flow in as short of a period of time as possible. The cerebral artery system is a highly branched system of blood vessels connected to the interior carotid arteries. The cerebral arteries are also very circuitous. Medical treatment devices should be able to navigate along the circuitous route posed by the cerebral arteries for placement into the cerebral arteries. Stroke patients are more likely to recover if doctors quickly perform a minimally invasive procedure to restore blood flow to the brain and remove damaging clots, rather than using clot-busting drugs alone. Findings recently presented at the International Stroke Conference in Nashville, Tenn., may change the way doctors handle many strokes, the fourth-leading cause of death in the U.S. They also show how important it is to immediately recognize stroke symptoms and get treatment. Currently, as many as 80 percent of patients with strokes caused by clots in the largest arteries in the brain die within three months or never regain independence. Rapid removal of a thrombus (i.e., blood clot) after ischemic stroke can greatly reduce the risk of the loss of brain function. Conventional treatment for removing the thrombus includes pharmacology and surgery. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a pharmaceutical, has been shown to help dissolve blood clots. Other drugs, including streptokinase and urokinase, have also been used. However, these drugs can take several hours to be effective. Blood clots can also be mechanically removed using a system called Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI®). It is believed that a system for thrombolysis that could easily be applied by an emergency room physician or physician's assistant would improve treatment and potentially save lives. Such thromboembolic disorders are typically characterized by the presence of a thromboembolus (i.e., a viscoelastic blood clot comprised of platelets, fibrinogen and other clotting proteins) which has become lodged at a specific location in a blood vessel. In cases where the thromboembolism is located in a vein, the obstruction created by the thromboembolus may give rise to a condition of blood stasis, with the development of a condition known as thrombophlebitis within the vein. Moreover, peripheral venous embolisms may migrate to other areas of the body where even more serious untoward effects can result. For example, the majority of pulmonary embolisms are caused by emboli that originate in the peripheral venous system, and which subsequently migrate through the venous vasculature and become lodged with the lung. In cases where the thromboembolus is located within an artery, the normal flow of arterial blood may be blocked or disrupted, and tissue ischemia (lack of available oxygen and nutrients required by the tissue) may develop. In such cases, if the thromboembolism is not relieved, the ischemic tissue may become infarcted (i.e., necrotic). Depending on the type and location of the arterial thromboembolus, such tissue infarction can result in death and amputation of a limb, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Notably, strokes caused by thromboembolic which become lodged in the small blood vessels of the brain continue to be a leading cause of death and disability, throughout the world. In modern medical practice, thromboembolic disorders are typically treated by one or more of the following treatment modalities: a) pharmacologic treatment wherein thrombolytic agents (e.g., streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and/or anticoagulant drugs (e.g., heparin, warfarin) are administered in an effort to dissolve and prevent further growth of the clot; b) open surgical procedures (e.g., surgical embolectomy or clot removal) wherein an incision is made in the blood vessel in which the clot is lodged and the clot is removed through such incision; and, c) transluminal catheter-based interventional procedures wherein a clot removing/disrupting catheter having a clot capturing receptacle (e.g., a basket, coil, hook, etc.), or clot-disrupting catheter having a clot disrupting apparatus (e.g., an ultrasound probe or laser)) is percutaneously inserted and advanced through the patient's vasculature to a location adjacent the clot. Each of the above-listed treatment modalities has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For example, pharmacologic treatment has the advantage of being non-invasive and is often effective in lysing or dissolving the clot. However, the thrombolytic and/or anticoagulant drugs used in these pharmacologic treatments can cause untoward side effects such as bleeding or hemorrhage. Also, in cases where time is of the essence, such as cases where an arterial thromboembolism is causing severe tissue ischemia (e.g., an evolving stroke or an evolving myocardial infarction) the time which may be required for the thrombolytic drugs to fully lyse or dissolve the blood clot and restore arterial blood flow may be too long to avoid or minimize the impending infarction. Open surgical thrombus-removing procedures can, in many cases, be used to rapidly remove clots from the lumens of blood vessels, but such open surgical procedures are notoriously invasive, often require general anesthesia, and the use of such open surgical procedures is generally limited to blood vessels which are located in surgically accessible areas of the body. For example, many patients suffer strokes due to the lodging of blood clots in small arteries located in surgically inaccessible areas of their brains and, thus, are not candidates for open surgical treatment. Transluminal, catheter-based interventional procedures are minimally invasive, can often be performed without general anesthesia, and can in some cases be used to rapidly remove a clot from the lumen of a blood vessel. However, such catheter-based interventional procedures are highly operator-skill-dependent, and can be difficult to perform in small or tortuous blood vessels. Conventional baskets include Flatwire baskets, Helical baskets and Multi-wire baskets, each having their own disadvantages, such as flatwire baskets being unsuitable for capturing small calculi given the limited wires in such baskets providing too much space. Helical baskets must be drawn back over entrapped calculi to attempt to sweep a stone into the basket and its filaments prevent the entry of large calculi. All such baskets require a body to enter within an extractor sheath with the cage in a retracted position. Accidental escapes of such baskets is common and damage to the adjacent tissue sometimes occurs during the treatment. There is a need to solve the problem of reliable capturing, immobilization and holding of calculi and thrombus, irrespective of their size. In addition to thrombus retrieval procedures, medical retrieval devices are often utilized for removing organic material (e.g., blood clots, tissue, and biological concretions such as urinary, biliary, and pancreatic stones) and inorganic material (e.g., components of a medical device or other foreign matter), which may obstruct or otherwise be present within a patient's body cavities. For example, concretions can develop in certain parts of the body, such as in the kidneys, pancreas, and gallbladder. Minimally invasive medical procedures are used to remove these concretions through natural orifices, or through an incision, such as during a percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNCL) procedure. Further, lithotripsy and ureteroscopy, for example, are used to treat urinary calculi (e.g., kidney stones) in the ureter of a patient. Known medical retrieval devices are complex in structure, requiring many components and labor-intensive manufacturing processes, and many do not provide controls for varying the size of the retrieval end of the device. Thus, there exists a need for the development of a new transluminally insertable, clot-capturing type embolectomy system, device and method to rapidly and selectively remove blood clots or other matter from small, delicate blood vessels of the brain, so as to provide an effective treatment for evolving strokes and other thromboembolic disorders. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In various embodiments, the present invention is directed to a hand-held gripping device that allows one of a surgeon, a dentist, and an orthodontist to reach interior portions of a person's anatomy, and includes a gripping portion having a pair of jaws movable relative to each other between fully clamped and fully opened positions thereof, a handle portion spaced apart from the jaw portion by a bendable central portion that has a hollow, bendable corrugated portion with at least one cord extending therethrough. Certain embodiments include a lamp or LED positioned near the gripping portion. In certain preferred embodiments, the central column of the device comprises a corrugated segment comprising a plurality of interconnected connectors, such as “loc-line” plastic elements. For certain embodiments that include the use of particular linked plastic components that comprise the flexible portion of the device, incorporated entirely by this reference are U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,155 to Lockwood; U.S. Pat. No. 5,778,939 to Hok-Yin; U.S. Pat. No. 5,667,146 to Pimental et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,533,906 to Luettgen. The handle portion comprises a first manually-actuatable trigger operatively connected to the gripping portion by a pull member at least substantially disposed within the central portion. Actuation of the trigger is operative to move the pull member to thereby selectively position the gripping elements between the fully clamped position and the fully opened position. The pull member preferably comprises at least one cord operatively connecting the handle portion to the gripping elements portion, with the at least one cord extending through the central portion. In certain embodiments, at least two separate portions of the central portion preferably comprise a plurality of interconnected connectors which together define a passageway through which said pull member passes through. In preferred embodiments, the plurality of interconnected connectors are in engagement with each other such that the interconnected connectors permit pivoting movement between the interconnected connectors. In still other embodiments, a bag is employed that fits over the gripping portion to enclose material within the bag after the jaws have been moved to a fully closed position. In particular embodiments, small bags can be employed to enclose a blood clot so that it does not break into various parts that could themselves cause harm to a patient. Other desired features include a lighting element operably associated with the gripping device. In certain embodiments, the bags employed have a closing ability such that once the gripping tool encircles the gripped material, with a bag pre-positioned over the gripping elements prior to contacting the material, the bag is closed via the pressure applied by the perimeter of the gripping elements when the user operates the trigger to close the gripping elements. Certain types of closure elements can be employed to accomplish this closure function, including but not limited to adhesive being applied to one or both opposing sides of an open bag in the area where the gripping elements contact each other in the closed positron. Other closure mechanisms involve the use of zip-lock mating features (e.g. zip-lock bags, etc.) such that the closed position of the jaws causes the zip-lock elements of the bag employed to seal the bag with the contents inside. In certain embodiments, the interiors of opposing gripping elements surfaces are fitted with a disposable liner, such as a biodegradable bag, prior to use such that the bag forms a covering to surround and encapsulate material. The peripheral ends of the liner are attached to the outside of gripping elements with the peripheral edge of the disposable bag including an adhesive strip adapted to adhere the edge of disposable bag, and also may be provided to ensure a better contact and connection with one or more of the gripping elements features. The bag is thus positioned and retained on the gripping elements. As one of skill will appreciate, various other bag retention features, such as elastomeric bands, clips, etc. can be employed to secure the bag in a fashion such that it remains in contact with the gripping elements during a gripping operation. A variety of bioactive agents may be applied to the nets or jaws, including but not limited to fibrinolytic agents (such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase and urokinase). Drugs used to treat thrombosis include, but are not limited to, tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, urokinase, lysokinase; staphylokinase, agents that convert plasminogen to fibrinolysin; fibrinolysin; fibrin modulatin, and the like. This permits the thrombus to be dissolved while it is being dislocated from the vessel where it is being removed, and in addition to other mechanical mechanisms that can make the object (such as a blood clot or other organic feature) smaller and thus permits blood flow to be restored thru the vessel. In this regard, the following are incorporated by reference U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,078,682; 8,453,637 and 201/40309657. Also incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference is 2014/0358162 to Di Natali. Systemic treatment with t-PA is associated with increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and other hemorrhagic complications. Patients treated with t-PA were more likely to sustain a symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage during the first 36 hours of treatment. In various embodiments, however, instead of systemic administration of typical amounts of tPA, far less amounts are administered directly to the site of the thrombus, preferably by the inclusion of an amount of such fibrinolytic agents in association with the distal end of the grasper device, preferably associated with the nets or jaws or the bags employed with various embodiments of the device. In such a manner, it is possible to have the thrombus dissolve during the thrombus extraction operation. One aspect of the present invention is directed to effectively sealing the material inside a bag after collection. While the above method employing adhesives is preferred, others can also be used, such as with ties, twisting of the bag, spinning the bag after it is filled with material, etc. Thus various types of bag fasteners or closure techniques may include a wide variety of devices that clamp, seal, fasten, hold, squeeze, or otherwise close the ends of the individual portions of a bag filled with material. Such fasteners may thus include ratchet ties, wire tie-type systems, such as a metal or wire twist tie, spring clamps, bands, adhesive tabs, peel seals, zippers, zip-locks, slider mechanisms, Velcro, or other devices to gather and hold the bag material in a tight or secure fashion. As described herein, employment of magnetic forces to retain and guide a blood clot, once captured, to a position where it can be extracted, also forms one aspect of many embodiments of the present invention. Such device can, however, also be used to capture material without using a bag. Certain embodiments include either two movable jaws, or a fixed jaw and a pivotally mounted jaw, preferably of similar design and each being in a dished-shaped configuration, as well as various types of grasper jaws, opposing nets, etc. The flexible nature of the present invention permits a user to adjust the jaw portion to be at any desired angle to enable the operator to operate the trigger by exerting a squeezing action on the trigger, thereby causing the movable jaw to move to its closed position so that in certain embodiments, a cuffed portion of a bag may be “peeled” downwardly and removed from the jaws, after which a twisting or other closure means (zip-lock bags, etc.) can be applied to the peeled portion of the bag. The bag and its contents may then be removed from between the jaws/nets and disposed of. From the above description, it will be apparent that only one hand is required for the operation of the device. The present invention, due partially to its ability to assume a compact dimension, can be employed by surgeons to extract blood clots, kidney stones, etc. In use, a user unfolds, extends or uncoils the shaft that extends between a handle and movable jaws, and places a bag in association with the jaws to secure the bag in place. The user can then place the open claw ends of the jaw, e.g. claw halves, over the material being collected and activate the triggering mechanism of the handle to close the claw halves to encircle and encompass the material. An assembly in accordance with the present invention may include a pair of jaws or nets fashioned into scoops that are adapted to encircle material (e.g. with optional tines, teeth, etc.) adapted to entrap material with the jaws/scoops attached to flexible lengths of material. The flexible segments may alternatively be covered by a flexible film that adds stiffness to the flexible length. In preferred embodiments, two relatively movable, complemental, coacting jaws are carried at the end of an elongated flexible member, preferably at least one portion thereof being corrugated and/or comprised of linked ball and socket jointed elements, and in some embodiments also telescopically adjustable into a locking length, with the jaws shaped and designed to scoop material gripped by the jaws. Thus, certain embodiments of the present invention include a pair of jaws/scoops that are connected to and employ a flexible extension and more preferably include the ability to have a bag placed over such jaws/scoops. A locking mechanism can be provided to keep the jaws closed. The opening and closing and locking of the jaws may be performed with one hand by an operator mechanism located away from the jaws. Incorporated herein by reference in their entireties are the following issued patents to provide sufficient written description and enablement of the many varied handle, trigger, articulated extension members, jaw, scoop and bag associated portions and features of the present invention: U.S. Pat.

No. 8,449,007 to Farmer; U.S. Pat. No. 6,845,736 to Anderson; U.S. Pat. No. 7,992,907 to DeJesus; U.S. Pat. No. 4,225,174 to Hennessy et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,155 to Lockwood; U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,537 to Kiemer and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0277015 to Stinis. A lighting element, such as a flashlight feature, may also be incorporated on the device. The specification describes a hand-held gripping device, comprising a jaw portion having a pair of jaws movable relative to each other between fully clamped and fully opened positions thereof, and a handle portion spaced apart from the jaw portion by a central portion, which in some embodiments may be adjustable in length via telescoping portions slidingly moved to attain a desired length. The handle portion comprises a manually-actuatable trigger (although in other embodiments the activation of the trigger is via an electronic button) operatively connected to the jaw portion by a pull member at least substantially disposed within the central portion. Actuation of the trigger is operative to move the pull member to thereby selectively position the pair of jaws between the fully clamped and fully opened position thereof. A selectively extendible central portion may comprise a first tubular member and, if the device is adjustable with respect to its length, may employ rotatable locking members to reversibly lock the respective portions of the central column into a fixed position. In certain embodiments, the central portion comprises a hollow, corrugated member having alternating ridges and grooves, such member being bendable so as to attain a predetermined shape. Suitable material for use in the central column will be known by those of skill in the art and alternative materials can be selected for various desired attributes, such as weight, cost, color, temperature characteristics, rigidity, corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, water permeability, glow in the dark characteristics, etc. Thus, suitable connector material for use as the entire, or alternatively only a portion of the central portion of the gripping device, may comprise a hollow, corrugated member having alternating ridges and grooves, such member being bendable so as to attain a predetermined shape, and may be made of a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and composites. The bendable portion of the central portion can be selectively or in a predetermined manner configured into a shape so as to facilitate easier access to a desired area, object, etc. The reversible nature of the bendable nature of the tool provides a user with the ability to adjust the angle of the distal portion of the tool to accommodate the myriad of difficult angles encountered by a user. Traditional remote access tools, which have straight and non-bending (as opposed to merely pivoting or telescoping) portions, are not able to achieve the desired remote access as provided by the present invention. In certain embodiments, at least one cord is employed that operatively connects the handle portion to the jaw portion, with such at least one cord extending through said central portion and through the hollow, corrugated member having alternating ridges and grooves. In certain embodiments, only the distal portion of the device has a segment of the hollow, corrugated member so as to limit the weight characteristics of such material as compared to the overall device. In certain embodiments, the hand-held gripping device has at least two-thirds of the central portion comprising a corrugated member. It has been found, however, that providing ten inches of such material is sufficient for many circumstances where a user desires to perform the desired bend to facilitate reaching an object to engage with the jaws of the device. As one will appreciate, however, any length of the hollow, corrugated member having alternating ridges and grooves can be used depending upon the circumstances. Thus, while in some embodiments, substantially the entire central portion comprises such material, in other embodiments; one or more sections of the central portion comprise such a hollow, corrugated member. In certain preferred embodiments, the distal portion has at least 1 inch of such hollow, corrugated member, more preferably at least about 3 inches of such material, and most preferably at least about 6 inches of such material. In other embodiments, at least two portions of the central column have sections with such hollow, corrugated member such that a user can preposition each section for a desired bent configuration, thus permitting the ability to reach an object remote from the user that may be difficult or impossible to reach using traditional gripper devices with straight central columns. In certain embodiments, the hand-held gripping device employs a handle portion that has a second manually-actuatable trigger, with such second trigger able to adjust the orientation of the distally positioned jaw portion by effecting a change in the shape of the one or more corrugated members along the extent of the central portion. In some embodiments, the trigger that functions to alter the bending of the corrugated member is a rotatable knob, such that many varied angular orientations of the distal end (with the jaws) can be attained via rotation of a knob positioned near or on the hand grip of the device. Electronic means can also be employed for such purpose, as well as for the operation of the jaws between their closed and open positions. While certain embodiments solely employ at least one section of a corrugated member to achieve desired bendable characteristics, other embodiments of the hand-held gripping device have a portion of said central portion that is in telescoping relationship with an adjacent portion of said central portion. Telescoping shafts may have two or more shaft members so long as each inner member is slightly smaller in cross-sectional area than the next outer member. In such embodiments, a locking member associated with said central portion is used to fix two adjacent members of said central portion in an engaged position, with the locking member operable between a first locking position and a second unlocking position. The locking member may comprise a coupling member, such as rotatable collar that can be manipulated by a user to adjust the griping member's length. In one embodiment, a section of corrugated hollow material is positioned at the distal end of the device, about 3 to 6 inches away from the jaws (and in the direction of the hand grip) and two adjacent members of the central column portion are operatively associated with each other in a slidingly telescoping relationship with a locking member being associated with at least one of the two adjacent members, the locking member comprising a selectively radially expandable mandrel to permit the length of the central column member to be varied. In certain embodiments, a pull member comprises first and second pull rods, and a cam body supporting a cam is used, with the pull rods associated with a cam support body. The cam is characterized by a first engaged condition in which the cam is in contact with the second pull rod to thereby fix the length of the pull member, and a second, disengaged condition in which the cam is out of contact with the second pull rod, to thereby permit the length of the pull member to be varied. The user-actuatable trigger comprises a manually operable release trigger provided on the handle portion, which is operatively connected to the cam via a connecting rod. One of skill in the art, especially guided by the incorporated references, will appreciate the varied types and features of gripping devices that can be constructed and that further incorporate the hollow corrugated member(s) as described herein in order to attain desired bendable capabilities of a particular user. For example, and without limitation, the present invention can be employed in a variety of fields where the problem of access around otherwise difficult angular orientations is presented, such fields including but not limited to surgeons and dentists/orthodontists to reach interior portions of a person's anatomy, etc. While preferably the bendable portion of the central column is made of a corrugated material (due to its ability to remain open in its central internal core, thus permitting pull cords to operate therein), those of skill in the art will appreciate that—especially dependent upon how severe and desired bending may be—that other types of bendable segments can be employed to achieve such a function. For example, pliable plastic or rubber-type sections can also be alternatively or in conjunction employed on a gripper device of the present invention so as to achieve the ability of a user to reach objects that would be difficult or nearly impossible to reach using a device having a straight and non-bendable column. Of course, the ability of such a section to uphold the weight of the jaws, especially after the jaws have grasped some desired object, is an important consideration when selecting appropriate materials to employ for the bendable portion of the column. In other words, a sufficient amount of rigidity and/or operational integrity of the central column is required for many applications. In still other embodiments of the present invention, one or more springs can be employed (with such spring(s) having desired structural integrity with respect to an ability to bend, an ability to support weight that may be encountered when the jaws engage an object and the device is lifted, etc). Thus, in one embodiment, a section of spring is used along the central portion of the device with a cord mechanism that is attached to the jaw end of the device, such that when the cord is pulled, the spring section bends to angularly adjust the jaws such that they can reach around corners/angles otherwise inaccessible with a straight column gripper device. To comply with appropriate written description and enablement requirements and to provide sufficient guidance in how one of skill in the art can make and use the various and numerous embodiments of the present invention, incorporated herein in their entireties are the following: Hsu, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,513,844; 6,520,556, 6,739,637, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,669,769 to Polder, Jr; U.S. Pat. No. 4,962,957 to Traber; U.S. Pat. No. 8,061,751 to Hatcher; U.S. Pat. No. 7,934,756 to Kroeze; U.S. Pat.

Some extendable tools have fixed tool heads, while others include a hand powered actuatable tool head assembly having movable elements, such as, but not limited to, a pruner/cutting implement or other various known tool head assemblies that may supplant or include clasping jaws. In still other embodiments, one device having a handle, trigger and flexible central portion is adapted to have replaceable and disenagagable distal end portions such that a user can achieve a myriad of different desired operations simply by removing and replacing end tools that have complementary detachable housings associated therewith that interact and reversibly connect to the non-handle end of the tool. For example, another aspect of the present invention is directed to the use of a double headed net which creates a trap or cage. Thus, in one embodiment, net assemblies are moveable from a closed position wherein the first net assembly is positioned in contact against the second net assembly, to an open position wherein the first net assembly is positioned a distance away from the second net assembly. The frames of each net assembly are configured to contact in a mating relationship when the jaw portion is moved to the closed position. Incorporated by reference in its entireties are U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2014/0047757 to Miller, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,908 to Blanchard, which are generally directed to types of net structures that may be employed in the manufacture and use of the various embodiments of the present invention, as well as U.S. Pat. Publication No. 20140054912 to Bustos and U.S. Pat. No. 7,677,619 to Hutchings for particular features, such as inclusion of lights, magnets, etc. in conjunction with the claimed device. As opposed to the prior art, where materials employed for the central column were hardened plastic polymers or any of substantially non-malleable metals, the present invention can be seen as distinctly different as it relates to employing materials and constructions that bend or are otherwise flexible so as to achieve the functional attributes that the prior art devices cannot achieve. In yet further embodiments of the present invention, various other features can be included, and detailed support for how such features can be implemented will be clear to one of skill in the art as guided by the present application, as well as the patent references incorporated herein. For example, magnets may be positioned on the distal end of the device. Sharp cutting implements may be added or supplanted to one or both of the jaws such that a severing operation can be performed. Such sharpened cutting jaws can alternatively be operated by a separate handle trigger—or simply provided in a fashion such that the cutting blade can be reversibly retracted by a user (either remotely via a handle trigger operation—or manually, prior to the extension of the device.) Similarly, suction cups can be positioned and affixed to the distal end of the device, whether on the jaws themselves or associated surfaces of the distal end, such that additional securement of remote objects is facilitated. Given the flexible nature of the device, it is possible to twist two separate extensions around each other, thus forming a single extension that comprises a twisted (helical) portion of a device, which can have two separate triggers to operate the pulling of cords extending in the separate extended, twisted portions. This facilitates further options for a user in certain situations where an additional set of operable distal features, such as a separate set of jaws, may be useful. A further object of the present invention is to provide a light source associated with the central portion section in connection with elongate gripper tools. A lighting source can also be positioned at the distal end of the device so that a user can more readily see the distal end and facilitate proper positioning of the distal end to perform operations, such as clamping of jaws around a distant object that may be in a darkened environment. LED lighting sources with small, battery powered energy sources are preferred, but one of skill in the art will appreciate, given the guidance provided herein, the vast variety of other lighting arrangements and features that can be employed while still being within the scope of the claimed invention. A magnifying viewing device (e.g., a distally positioned camera) can also be provided to assist the user in viewing the distal end of the device in particular applications, such as when a detailed and sensitive manipulation of a remote object is required and the user requires magnification of the distal end to properly position the device to perform desired functions. Love of how easy a device can be employed is often the deciding factor in a medical device purchase/use decision. The present invention satisfies this long felt but unsolved desire. Recent developments in medical technology and associated treatments have been focused on clearing or removing thromboembolisms or “blood clots” from the cervical and cerebral vasculature in order to treat thromboembolic stroke victims. Thromboembolic stroke is a life threatening condition that consists of arrested blood flow to a region of the brain due to a thromboembolisum blocking a blood vessel feeding that region. Such thrombi often originate in the left heart chambers, break free into the aorta and flow downstream into the cervical neck arteries e.g. carotid arteries, and then ultimately lodge into a narrowed vessel somewhere down the narrowing vascular tree of the cerebral arteries associated with the brain in the head. Once lodged, the thrombus occludes flow along the vessel downstream of the blockage, thus arresting blood flow to the downstream blood vessel and causing the stroke. Life lessons and experiences of surgeons inform them as to what tools they employ to address specific problems. Occlusion of a blood vessel can be caused by a thrombus (i.e., blood clot) that forms in a blood vessel, or by an embolus, i.e., a blood clot that travels downstream. The blockage disrupts blood flow, which prevents oxygen and nutrients from being delivered to their intended locations. Tissue distal to a blood clot that is deprived of oxygen and nutrients can no longer function properly. For every minute that treatment is delayed, additional cellular death of critical tissue can occur. As used herein a “vessel” or “lumen” refers to blood vessels (including arteries and veins) and other suitable body organs having a lumen, such as the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum), bile ducts, urinary bladder, ureter, urethra, trachea, bronchi, and the like. Pulmonary embolisms occur in the pulmonary arteries. Typically, access to such pulmonary embolisms is achieved using an introducer device that is inserted into a patient into their femoral vein in the pelvic area of the patient. The tools and devices needed to treat the pulmonary embolism are then inserted through the introducer into the femoral vein through the inferior vena cava to the patient's heart. Other access locations into the venous circulatory system of a patient are possible, for example, the user can gain access through the jugular vein, the subclavian vein, the brachial vein or any other vein that connects or eventually leads to the superior vena cava. Use of other vessels that are closer to right atrium of the patient's heart are attractive because it reduces the length of the instruments needed to reach the pulmonary embolism. More than ever, the focus of present surgical practice is on speed, efficiency, ease of use and cost effectiveness. The present invention satisfies all of these. Current technology for blood flow restoration, for example for treating cerebral arteries occluded by thrombi, can often take hours to reestablish flow in the artery, and can lead to unintended complications. Apparatus and methods for treating cerebral thrombi are often ineffective or only partially effective at resolving thrombus removal, and may result in distal embolization or embolization of uninvolved arteries. For example, some current devices are designed to pierce through a thrombus, or are designed to deploy distally to the thrombus before engaging the thrombus. These devices often fail to capture all of a thrombus, can damage vessel walls distal of a thrombus, can be difficult to maneuver, can unintentionally dislodge portions of a thrombus prior to capture, and/or can take significant amounts of time to restore blood flow. Dislodgment of portions of the thrombus, referred to as secondary emboli, often cause complications because the secondary emboli may travel downstream and occlude other vessels or arteries. The meaning of a successful retrieval of an object varies, as some would say capturing the object is the goal, while others would say it is about successful removal of the object without further damage to a patient. The present invention accomplishes both. Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to “basket” retrieval surgical devices that have a net assembly at a distal end able to surround a captured stone, thrombus or calculi during retrieval. Unlike prior art devices, which while having basket-type devices, collapse into the distal end of a catheter during insertion, and are then extended from the end of the catheter when deployed, preferred embodiments of the present invention do not require retraction of the net assemblies into a catheter. Some types of these instruments employ a retrieval collapsible basket arranged within a flexible catheter formed as a tubular sheath with the basket and the sheath moving relative to each other to open and close the basket. The basket can retract inside the sheath or protract from the catheter to open the basket to form a cage to thus allow entrance of the object into the basket. Retraction of the basket into the sheath results in the cage collapsing and entrapping the object in the basket. Other types of retrieval devices employ miniaturized grasping legs that are unattached at a distal end of the grabber and joined at a proximal base of the grabber. The legs are movable relative to the sheath to achieve a contracted position within the sheath and an extended position outside of the sheath in the form of an open grasper. The distal ends of the legs are farther apart from each other when the grabber is in the open position than when in the closed position. The grasping legs are typically formed of elastic wires with insufficient rigidity to reliably hold retrieved objects and thus, the legs may deform and drop the objects during operation. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the various features described herein can be employed separately or in combination to achieve desired objectives. Other traditional devices employ a single loop snare that requires skilled manipulation to capture a desired object. In an attempt to provide a snare with improved cross sectional vessel coverage, multi loop snares have been developed. These snares include loops which are joined only at their proximal ends to a manipulation shaft, and otherwise are not joined at any point between the shaft and the distal ends of the loops. Such loops often become displaced and/or entangled, thus preventing the snare from opening during operation. Moreover, unlike prior art basket-type retrieval devices, which typically require a physician to advance the device past a stone mass, followed by deployment of the retrieval device, and subsequent pulling back of the basket toward the stone to capture the stone, various preferred embodiments of the present invention provide the ability to secure stone masses without having to move the device past a stone. Additionally, prior art basket retrieval devices often become stuck or wedged during stone removal, resulting in damage to surrounding tissue or tissue lining caused by a physician forcing the basket and stone through an area in which the stone has become stuck or wedged. To avoid such damage, it may be necessary to release the stone and break it into smaller fragments. Unfortunately, typical basket retrieval devices do not allow the physician to release easily the stone and continue breaking it up before removal is again attempted. Similar situations arise using prior art surgical “graspers” instead of a basket device. Typical graspers employ three or four prongs that are manipulated to capture a stone from the front side of the stone, by grasping it. When a stone becomes stuck or wedged during removal, such graspers are able to release the stone. Unfortunately, typical graspers often do not hold on to stones as well as baskets. Moreover, it can be difficult to capture a stone using a grasper, and once captured, it is easy for the stone to be released inadvertently. Thus, in the past, over the course of a procedure, a physician often needs to use both graspers and basket-type devices to manipulate a stone, break up the stone, and remove fragments of the stone. Using current graspers and baskets, a physician may need to switch devices during the procedure. Switching devices typically requires withdrawal of one device and insertion of another. Certain embodiments of the surgical retrieval device include a retrieval assembly having a plurality of spring-like finger members, which may be composed of nitinol, stainless steel, a Co—Cr alloy, or a titanium alloy, though other materials also may be used. In various aspects of the present invention, a surgical retrieval device is inserted into a body tract while the multi-fingered retrieval assembly is in a closed position as the retrieval device is placed in and maneuvered to capture material. Once the material is captured, the retrieval device, along with the material, are withdrawn from the body. In various embodiments, netting material can be associated with the plurality of fingers so as to achieve the advantageous of both the grasper and the basket-type devices. Thus, a surgical retrieval device may be adapted to have a distal end (preferably replaceable) that permits the device to be used as a grasper for grasping material similar to forceps. In other situations, the distal end can be a multi-fingered retrieval net assembly so that the device may be used as a basket-type retrieval device to capture material within a basket formed by the netting stretched between the fingers of the multi-finger retrieval assembly. In preferred embodiments, the distal portion of the preferred surgical retrieval device of the present invention is designed to capture not only the thrombus, but also any secondary emboli, and therefore, prevent secondary emboli from traveling downstream during clot retrieval. There has been a long felt an unmet need to provide a surgical device that is adept at removing harder material, such as calcium (e.g. harder than thrombus and plaque). Cutting and removal of such harder materials has generally required additional procedure time and increased risks. It is also important to have a device that is easy to use by a physician and are compatible with present therapeutic devices and methods. Embodiments of the present disclosure contemplate various mechanical cutting features provided in combination with the jaws. In certain embodiments, the surgical device set forth here can be employed to treat pulmonary embolization by the appropriate placement of a thrombus filter in the vascular system of a patient's body. Placement of the filter may be accomplished by intravenous insertion of a thrombus filter in a patient's vascular system, which is less invasive and requires only a local anesthetic. Once placed inside a blood vessel, a thrombus filter acts to catch and hold blood clots. The flow of blood around the captured clots allows the body's lysing process to dissolve the clots. Preferably, both the thrombus filer and the nets/jaws have tPA or other fibrinolytic agents associated therewith. Some medical instruments can reduce the invasiveness and potential trauma previously associated with various medical procedures. The removal of a calculus, such as, for example, a kidney stone, a ureteral stone, a urethral stone, a urinary bladder stone, or a stone in the biliary tree such as a gallbladder stone or a bile duct stone and the like from the body is one area where certain embodiments of the present instruments may be used with some success. Various instruments can permit the removal of stones and other material from the body without the need for major surgery. Generally, a grasping device is guided through the body to the site of the stone and is used to grasp and remove the stone under the guidance of an endoscope. One problem with known baskets is that it often is difficult to remove the basket containing the material from the body without damaging the surrounding tissue and it is not possible to release the captured material from the basket. In some instances, a stone is of such a size that it is incapable of being removed while it is captured within the basket. In other instances, the body duct or orifice, such as the ureter or ureteral orifice junction (where the ureter and bladder join), is too small to allow for passage of the basket with the captured stone. If an excessive force is used to attempt to remove the basket and the captured material, tissue may be damaged. Sometimes surgery is required to dislodge both the basket and the captured material. To address such issues, certain embodiments include cutting elements (see FIG. 15 ) to reduce the size of the clot while captured in the opposing nets. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a magnetic particle associated with a thrombus in the lumen of a blood vessel is guided by a magnet located external to the blood vessel, with the magnet having a magnetic field to exert a unidirectional magnetic force to the magnetic particle connected to a thrombus. The magnet located external to the blood vessel may either be external to the patient's body, or may be associated with the grapser device of the present invention, such that close physical location of the thrombus (or other foreign object) which has had a magnetic component associated therewith, can be guided through passages, such as a bloodstream, to move via the assistance of such magnetic force to a desired point where the thrombus can be extracted. The wire rims of nets or the jaws themselves may be magnetic in various embodiments. Embodiments discussed here relate to a method and system for thrombolysis using magnetic forces to affect a thrombus, commonly known as a blood clot. While particularly suited for use after ischemic stroke, the method and system disclosed herein can also be used as a preventive measure or to treat other related or unrelated medical conditions, such as by removal of other undesired objects in a person, such as kidney stones, and other particles that one wants to remove form the body. Magnetic particles may comprise ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, or superparamagnetic nanoparticles, or particles with another type of magnetism, such as diamagnetism. In certain embodiments, superparamagnetic nanoparticles are used, which are ferromagnetic materials of small enough size that their magnetization is not retained in the absence of an external magnetic field. The magnetic particles can be conjugated to a thrombus-specific attachment agent such as an anti-fibrin antibody. In preferred embodiments, however, larger but still small magnetic particles are employed to either associate with a foreign body, such as a thrombus or kidney stone, etc. either by having the foreign object skewered or inserted with a metal, preferably magnet, into the foreign body, so that an external (to the object) magnetic force can be then used to guide the object to a desired place for treatment or extraction from the patient's body. The operator may direct the magnetic field to agitate or move the magnetic particles so that the thrombus is agitated or moved. Ultimately, the objective is to have the foreign object guided to a place where it can be removed. With respect to a thrombus, this allows blood to resume flowing in the bloodstream, or may serve to increase the flow of blood in the bloodstream. The magnetic field may also be used to trap the magnetic particles at or about the thrombus or to hold it in place, or to move the thrombus to a different location where a blood vessel is wider, to allow blood flow or increased blood flow. In some embodiments, the moving magnetic field may be caused a physical displacement of magnets to manipulate the magnetic particle, resulting in the agitation of the thrombus. An electromagnet or a bank of electromagnets may create the moving magnetic field through a variation of electrical signals to generate varying magnetic forces to manipulate the magnetic particle associated with the foreign body, such as a thrombus. Persons with skill in the art will recognize that other approaches for generating static or moving magnetic fields or varying magnetic forces can also be used. In many embodiments, the use of a rare earth magnet place external to the patient but in close proximity to the internally located magnetic particle (which is associated with the foreign body) can be employed to guide the foreign body out of the body. In addition, the operator may also apply a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to the thrombus in various ways and the agitation of the magnetic particle can make the thrombolytic agent more effective at dissolving the thrombus. Preferably, the thrombus is retained during such dissolving event within the opposing nets of a preferred embodiment of the invention. Application of a unidirectional magnetic force may also be employed to compress the thrombus to allow blood flow to resume; or a pulsing magnetic force may be applied to break apart the thrombus, but preferably such breaking of the thrombus is only conducted when the thrombus is fully enclosed by an opposing net structure as described herein. The magnet(s) employed in a thrombus removal procedure according to embodiments of the present invention may be a permanent magnet, preferably a rare earth magnet, or an electromagnet, and such magnetic force is preferably located external to a patient's body to generate a magnetic field external to the patient's body, but with enough force to penetrate beneath a surface of the patient's body to the region of the thrombus. The magnetic particle, preferably having a sharp end (so as to more easily pierce a thrombus body, and even more preferably having at least one barb, more preferably at least two barbs—similar to a fish hook) may include ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, or super-paramagnetic components or a particle with diamagnetism. A magnetic particle may be conjugated to one or more thrombus specific attachment agents, such as anti-fibrin antibodies, as another way to associate magnetic characteristics to the thrombus to aid in its removal from the bloodstream. The magnetic field of a magnet exterior to the person's body (or that is associated with the jaws or opposing nets of the device) attracts the thrombus to hold it in place using a magnetic force exerted by the magnetic field. The magnetic particle preferably attaches to the thrombus (or other article desired to be removed) so that it may be moved or distorted so that the blood may resume flowing in the blood vessel or may generally serve to increase the flow of blood in the bloodstream associated with the blood vessel or to a particular portion of the patient's body, such as moved to a different location where the blood vessel is wider, to allow blood flow or increased blood flow. Preferably a magnet is moved in proximity to the blood vessel to exert a magnetic force on the magnetic particle associated with the thrombus, sometimes in conjunction with the magnetic force exerted by magnetic elements associated with a pair of opposing nets, thus permitting thrombus removal even in instances where an inserted magnetic element becomes detached or dissociated from the thrombus. The thrombolytic agent (THA) may dissolve the thrombus while the manipulated magnetic particle agitates or moves the thrombus, such as to a different location where the blood vessel is wider, to allow blood to flow or to increase its flow. When held in this different location, the thrombolytic agent THA can more effectively dissolve the thrombus because the thrombus may be more accessible and allows more time for thrombolytic agent THA to work on the thrombus without the patient incurring excessive tissue damage dying. In particular embodiments, instead of administering tPA systemically to a patient, which may result in bleeding occurring at other undesired places in a person's brain and body, tPA (or another thrombus dissolving agent) is associated with the retrieval device itself, such that more direct administration of the thrombus dissolving agent can occur at approximately the same time that the thrombus is first located by the retrieving device. Thus, in one embodiment, a tPA capsule is placed inside the pair of opposing nets and the net structure is then positioned through the patient's blood vessels to the location of the thrombus. The net structure is then manipulated to encompass the thrombus, and at the same time, the tPA capsule is fractured to release the tPA to dissolve the thrombus. The capsule can be constructed such that it has thrombus associated factors that essentially attract or glue the capsule to the thrombus for a direct connection and thus, administration of the clot dissolving agent. Alternatively, employing one of the particular devices as described herein, a cutting tool also provided in conjunction with the pair of nets is used to release the contents of the capsule, preferably just after the nets encompass the thrombus to be treated. The capsule can also be constructed in a fashion so that it is rendered frangible upon application of the external magnetic force, thus providing yet another way to ensure that the capsule is not fractured until desired by the surgeon. Thus, the capsule can be provided with a separate magnetic particle or element to achieve such operations. A unidirectional force may be applied to such magnetic particle, or a pulsing electrical signal to pulse the electromagnetic force, or even an oscillating electrical signal, may be used to align a polarity of a magnetic particle. Persons having skill in the art will recognize that other approaches for manipulating the magnetic particle may be used. Unlike prior art methods, preferred embodiments of the present invention do not rely on injection of metal particles into the blood stream to attach to thrombus portions. Rather, the purposeful and directed spearing of a thrombus by a ferrous or magnet attracted particle, preferably a magnetic particle, is accomplished when the thrombus is reached by the opposing jaws and/or nets of the present device such that the thrombus is able to be encompassed by the device so that it does not disintegrate and break into pieces that can then travel through the bloodstream and potentially harm the patient. Preferably, the thrombus is encompassed by the jaws or nets of the present invention such that its extraction is controlled in a manner so that if the thrombus does break apart, the portions separating from the main thrombus will be encompassed by the jaws/nets. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the jaws/nets are themselves magnetic in a fashion such that they assist in attracting the ferrous or magnetic particle that is injected or speared into the thrombus. Thus, the enclosure of a thrombus with a ferrous or magnetic particle residing therein (due to it being inserted by the device upon approach to the thrombus) is made easier due to the magnetic attraction between the speared thrombus and the magnetic forces of the jaws/nets. The exterior application of a magnetic force, preferably attractive to the ferrous/magnetic particle of the speared thrombus and/or to the magnetized jaws/nets of the device, then facilitate guidance of the thrombus to a desired place within the bloodstream, preferably enabling a surgeon to extract the thrombus in a safe manner, without the scattering of thrombus portions, as they are both preferably trapped by the jaws/nets of the device, as well as being magnetically attracted to both the exterior magnetic forces being applied, as well as to those provided by the jaws/nets. Moreover, the magnetic characteristics of the end portions of the device, preferably the magnetic jaws and nets employed in preferred embodiments, are steerable through a patient's bloodstream (or other bodily passageway) by application of an exterior (to the patient's skin) magnetic force, provided by a rare earth magnet and/or electromagnet that is employed to draw the jaws/nets to a position in the bloodstream as desired. U.S. Pat. No. 8,827,948 to Romo et al. is incorporated herein in its entirety for discussion of structures that may be employed. Surgeons who have been trying to show the benefit of mechanical recanalization in ischemic stroke patients for years can now do so employing the present invention so that an effective embolectomy device can open brain vessels during acute stroke. While other aspects of the present invention include the use of other devices proven to be effective in this regard, the addition of a magnetic thrombus-encompassing, distal end of a device, coupled with the magnetic characteristics of such distal end, and preferably with the ability to spear a thrombus with a ferrous or magnetic particle such that the thrombus can be better controlled for extraction purposes, makes the present invention a better way to achieve desired success with stroke victims. For example, in several embodiments of the present invention, the Trevo® Retriever, which has been shown to be superior to older generation embolectomy devices, can be employed to contact a thrombus. But the device is improved by having the distal portion (the portion that contacts the thrombus) rendered magnetic, and further able to spear a thrombus (as otherwise described herein) in such a manner that the thrombus is rendered capable of being guided through the bloodstream via the magnetic attractive forces employed both by the distal end of the device, as well as supplemental magnetic force guidance provided by an exteriorly positioned magnetic force. Preferably, tPA is associated with the distal jaws/nets to dissolve the thrombus. One of skill in the art will appreciate that various portions of an acceptable thrombus retrieval device can possess structural features of prior art devices, such as the above referenced Trevo® Retriever, but importantly having at least one corrugated member as described herein so as to provide the desired flexibility required to reach the often convoluted vessels in a patient's body. Thus, in one embodiment, a medical device is provided that is configured to perform an endovascular therapy, e.g., thrombectomy, and includes an elongate manipulation member and an intervention member, with the intervention member having an end portion, which can be a pair of jaws, opposing nets or mesh, with such end portion preferably being magnetic such that it is attractive to a magnet positioned outside the patient's body. WO 2015038487 to Davidson is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety to provide a written description as to certain elements that may be incorporated into the variety of devices that may be employed in this regard. As opposed to many prior art devices, instead of being self-expandable from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration, the jaws or nets are purposefully operated so as to be in either an open or closed position, thus providing a surgeon with an unprecedented ability to control the position of the jaws/nets, rather than, for example, having them self-expanding simply because they are at a certain point beyond the distal end of a lumen. While one of skill in the art will appreciate that the opposing nets and jaws of the present invention may also be constructed so that they can fit into a lumen, for example during the traveling of the lumen through blood vessels, and by doing so making it less likely that injury to the interior surfaces of a blood vessel occurs, in other embodiments, the jaws or nets are shaped, configured and connected so as to be always positioned outside of the distal portion of the lumen. In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a method that can be implemented to perform an endovascular endarterectomy procedure using the devices as described herein. In such procedures, the selectively bendable remote gripping device as described herein is inserted into a patient's bloodstream and the gripping portion of the device is then positioned between a volume of plaque tissue or a blood clot, preferably disposed circumferentially about the volume of plaque tissue. Preferably, and being one of the distinguishing aspects of certain embodiments, there is no need for a guide wire to be employed in such procedures, further distancing the present invention form the prior art. Similarly, the provision of a cutting instrument inside an opposing pair of grasping elements, such as the opposing nets of certain embodiments, provides the ability of a surgeon to position such severing element to cut up or break up plaque and other vascular obstructions within the jaws or nets so that the vascular obstruction is reduced to smaller pieces which can be readily removed, such as via being aspirated through an aspiration lumen. In some aspects, the severing element may have a longitudinal length that does not extend distally beyond the distal-most edge of the jaws or nets. In another embodiment, in various aspects, the distal end of the device includes spring-like fingers that extend longitudinally so as to be parallel to a vasculature wall when in use. The fingers may be configured to serrate and/or dislodge a plaque or other obstruction from a vasculature wall, and importantly, in certain embodiments, may be used in conjunction with a small enclosure, such as a bag, that is fitted over the fingers such that a thrombus can be encompassed in such bag. As described herein, in certain embodiments, preferably the thrombus is speared in a fashion such that it does not break up into pieces, but rather, is somewhat like a skewered article, which once penetrated by a magnetically attractive spearing material, can then be controllably directed to a desired site of treatment or exit from the patient's body via the application of an external magnetic force. Thus, while in certain embodiments the thrombus may break up once manipulated as described herein, preferably the pieces are entrapped within preferred opposing net structures (as described herein) a severing element may be configured to purposefully be a thrombus-breaking element configured to break apart blood clots once they are enclosed within the closed net structure, facilitating passage of the thrombus through small vessel passageways that might not otherwise be traversed if the thrombus was not broken apart for transport through such vessels. The ability to promptly address ischemic issues by providing a flexible device that can access the small vessels in a patient's brain where a thrombus may get lodged, such flexibility resulting from the corrugated nature of the linear extension of the device, coupled with the provision of a hand-held handle with a trigger that fits nicely into a surgeon's hand such that the surgeon has a particular “feel” for the instrument and can thus better manipulate its functions, further coupled with a distal functional end-piece that in various embodiments provides at least a pair of either jaws/scoops that can be reversibly opened and closed, so as to ensnare a thrombus—or alternatively a netting structure (including but not limited to a taut net coupled with a looser net pair such that a thrombus can be encompassed and controlled within the confines of the pair; and further coupled with the magnetic properties provided to either the thrombus itself (via insertion of a ferrous or other magnetic particle into the thrombus either just before or after encompassing the thrombus by jaws, nets, flexible fingers, etc.)—or via the magnetic properties associated with the grasping end unit (such as the magnetic attraction of the opposed jaws/nets, which can also serve to be magnetically directed through a patient's vessels either before and/or after the thrombus is secured by the device; and that still further provides a way to ensure that the thrombus does not disintegrate prior to securing it in an enclosure (thus precluding the prospect that further harm will be caused due to a thrombus breaking apart and such portions lodging into still further smaller vessels where they may cause harm),—results in an unprecedented ability to achieve the long sought for objective of treating ischemic events in a timely and effective manner and that is far easier and user-friendly than prior art devices and methods. Literally millions of lives will be spared, as well as millions more quality of lives will be preserved, due to this simple but important advance. In one preferred embodiment, after the capture of an object, such as a thrombus, by an opposing net structure that has magnetic components associated therewith (e.g. such as a magnetic element being connected near to the distal end of the flexible extent) it is possible to employ a magnetic force, such as a rare earth magnet positioned outside the patient's body, manipulate the captured object to a desired position, such as backing out the flexible structure along its route to a region where the object can be retrieved or removed from the patient. This aspect of removal of an object based on magnetic attraction is different from prior art techniques as in prior art methods magnetic particles are injected to associate with a thrombus, apparently based on the prospect that such magnetic particles would not be otherwise injurious to a patient, would solely be directed to just the thrombus site at issue, and would permit a surgeon to remove the thrombus at interest without further disintegration of the blood clot. In contrast to prior art systems, certain embodiments of the present invention require the provision of a single magnetic element to be associated with the thrombus to be retrieved. Thus, in certain embodiments, a magnetic component, preferably a rare earth rod, most preferably sharpened so as to facilitate entrance into a thrombus particle, similar to spearing of a thrombus body (on a larger scale, analogized as putting a magnetic skewer into a hotdog so that the magnetic skewer can be manipulated by a separate magnet to thus move and manipulate the hotdog), renders the thrombus body magnetic in a fashion that it can now be better controlled for removal. Because a typical problem and concern with respect to a thrombus is that it may fracture and disintegrate into several pieces, in preferred embodiments of the invention involve capturing the thrombus, such as by the opposing jaws/nets of the present invention, prior to inserting a magnetic skewer into the thrombus. This can be accomplished by employing certain embodiments of the present invention whereby after the jaws/nets are closed around the thrombus, a separate trigger (that is connected to a separate cord extending through the flexible extent of the device) is pulled to cause a pre-loaded magnetic skewer to be forced outward, into the space created between the opposing jaws/nets, such that an entrapped thrombus can be skewered by the magnetic thrombus-contacting rod. It is believed that by simply having a magnetic component associated with the distal end of the thrombus engaging end of the device, however, one can dispense with the need to facilitate a magnetic rod being inserted into the thrombus, and thus reduce the risk that the thrombus may break apart)—as the ability to magnetically manipulate the captured thrombus by simply manipulating the magnetic component associated with the distal end of the flexible device is all that is required for most retrieval operations. Various embodiments of the present invention provide a surgical extractor which is capable of capturing and releasing foreign or biological material (e.g. stones, calculi, etc.) and that employ a corrugated member that provides unprecedented flexibility to reach and manipulate a thrombus and other objects sought to be removed from a patient's body. In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, a surgical retrieval device employs spring-like fingers in conjunction with a bag or netting material to entrap and to retrieve foreign or biological material. One will appreciate that this Summary of the Invention is not intended to be all encompassing and that the scope of the invention nor its various embodiments, let alone the most important ones, are necessarily encompassed by the above description. One of skill in the art will appreciate that the entire disclosure, as well as the incorporated references, pictures, etc. will provide a basis for the scope of the present invention as it may be claimed now and in future applications."
10362738,Work vehicle,2015-09-10,2,2,"BACKGROUND Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to a work vehicle. More specifically, the present invention relates to a work vehicle having a work implement and a cover. Background Information A work vehicle is a machine used in construction, mining, forestry, farming, etc. Such work vehicles typically have at least one work implement coupled to the vehicle body. The at least one work implement is often movable but can be stationary in some cases. Such work vehicles can use tracks or wheels in order to propel and/or steer, and in order to support the main body of the work vehicle. One example of such a work vehicle is a feller buncher. A feller buncher is a type of harvester used in logging. It is a motorized vehicle with an attachment that can rapidly cut and gather one or more trees before felling them. Feller is a traditional name for someone who cuts down trees, and bunching is the skidding and assembly of two or more trees. A feller buncher performs both of these harvesting functions and includes a standard heavy equipment base with a tree-grabbing device furnished with a chain-saw, circular saw or shear designed to cut trees off at the base. The machine then places the cut tree on a stack suitable for a skidder or forwarder, or other means of transport (yarding) for further processing (e.g., delimbing, bucking, loading, or chipping). Feller bunchers are often tracked work vehicles, and can be leveling or non-leveling. The work implement of a feller buncher includes an articulating arm and/or boom and a feller head can be attached to the end of the boom. In other work vehicles, other types of work implements can be attached, such as excavator implements (bucket), bulldozer blade, or any other suitable work implements. , It has been discovered that some work vehicles are operated at locations where debris may fall on the work vehicle. For example, a feller buncher works cutting down trees, which can result in leaves, branches and/or wood chips/sawdust falling onto the work vehicle. Other work vehicles also work where debris can fall such as construction sites, mines, farms and the forest. If a work vehicle has moving parts, such as an articulating arm or boom, the moving parts may be exposed to falling debris. With such a work vehicle, debris may fall in a coupling portion between a vehicle body and a work implement. In such a case, there is a possibility that the debris could affect the movement of the work implement. Therefore, one object of the present invention is to provide a work vehicle, which reduces the possibility of debris falling into coupling portions between work vehicle main bodies and work implements, and thus, reduces the possibility of falling debris impacting operation of the work implement of the work vehicle. In view of the state of the known technology and in accordance with a first aspect of the present disclosure, a work vehicle is basically provided that includes a vehicle body, a work implement, a first cover, and a second cover. The work implement is movably coupled to the vehicle body. The first cover is coupled to the work implement. The second cover is hingedly coupled to the vehicle body and is at least partially overlappingly disposed on the first cover. Also other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the disclosed work vehicle will become apparent to those skilled in the work vehicle field from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses one embodiment of the work vehicle."
10362739,Methods and systems for irrigation control,2015-12-15,2,1,"BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for monitoring and controlling irrigation and climate conditions in landscapes (such as, e.g., municipal parks, gardens, and sports fields) and agricultural environments (such as, e.g., open agricultural fields, greenhouses, and other sites growing crops). Irrigation systems supply water to soil. They are primarily used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops and maintenance of landscapes. Irrigation systems typically include valves, controllers, pipes, and emitters such as sprinklers or drip tapes. Irrigation systems can be divided into zones because there is usually not enough pressure and available flow to run sprinklers or other water emitting components (e.g. drip tapes) for an entire yard, sports field, or other irrigation site at once. Each zone has a solenoid valve that is controlled via a typically wired connection by an irrigation controller. The irrigation controller is either a mechanical or electrical device that signals a zone to turn on at a specific time and keeps it on for a specified amount of time or until it gets turned off manually. Branch pipes in each zone are fed by a main line or common supply pipe. Valves are either controlled manually by a person or electronically by a solenoid that is connected to a controller. In existing systems, controllers are typically wired to the solenoid valves and the energy/power to actuate them is provided through wires. Controllers can decide to turn on/off valves based on schedules, weather information, and/or sensor readings. Water can be pumped into the main line from a well source or a city supply. A “smart controller” is a controller that is capable of adjusting the watering time by itself in response to current environmental conditions. Smart controllers determine current conditions using historic weather data for the local area, soil moisture sensors (water potential or water content), weather stations, or a combination of these. Weather based smart controllers for irrigation can provide the appropriate watering schedule, adjust for weather changes, and irrigate based on the needs of the field and/or landscape. A smart controller will automatically reduce the watering times or frequency as the weather gets cooler and less water is needed. Then, as the weather begins to warm up, the controller will add more watering time or increase the watering frequency. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the rate of water loss from the field or other irrigation site. It is nature's process for transferring moisture to the atmosphere by the evaporation of water from the soil and transpiration of water from plant surfaces. ET measurements can be used for determining crop irrigation needs.

10138171,Method for altering photosynthetic growth,2016-01-12,1,1,"PRIORITY This application claims the benefit of provisional patent application Ser. No. 62/104,797 filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Jan. 18, 2015, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. INTRODUCTION The use of conventional fertilizers and pesticides contaminate our drinking water supply and adversely affect ecosystems and wildlife in the areas where they are applied and, more extensively, through runoff. Certain cancers and reproductive problems, among other medical conditions, have been related to the use of fertilizers and pesticides, both through direct exposure and through runoff. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced findings that glyphosate, the most popular weed killer globally, is a probable carcinogen; the number of lawsuits is increasing; California has moved to label glyphosate as carcinogenic; and states for several years have been incentivizing greener lawn care to reduce pollution from runoff. Thus, there is a need for a process to enhance or inhibit plant growth, similar to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, but without the adverse effects. Presently, there are no fertilizers or pesticides that implement non-toxic, pigmented matter to alter photosynthetic activity without adversely affecting the environment or human health. While there are all-natural fertilizers and pesticides available on the market, none of them are both all-natural and make use of the sun's renewable energy. Further, some all-natural fertilizers have been linked to infectious disease outbreaks. Photosynthetic organisms use pigments to absorb light energy, which they subsequently convert into chemical energy for food via photosynthesis. Plants and certain other photosynthetic organisms contain several types of pigments. Each pigment absorbs light concentrated at specific wavelengths. The absorption of energy from light promotes vegetative growth and enhances nutrients. In many photosynthetic organisms, red light is absorbed to a lesser degree than blue light, although absorption rates may vary depending on the type of plant and the time of year. Red light promotes flowering and budding of plants and provides energy that is converted into food, among other things. Blue light enables chloroplast movement, phototropism, stomatal opening, and seedling growth regulation, among other things. Chlorophyll is a primary pigment found in most photosynthetic organisms. Chlorophyll-a, C 55 H 72 O 5 N 4 Mg, is a dominant pigment occurring in all photosynthetic organisms, including cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll-a exhibits a green color and absorbs mostly blue and red light, with absorption peaks at approximately 430 nm and 662 nm, respectively. Absorption peaks represent the wavelengths of light energy that are absorbed at the greatest magnitude by the absorbing medium. Thus, out of all of the colors on the electromagnetic spectrum, chlorophyll-a absorbs blue (430 nm) and red (662 nm) light at the greatest magnitude. Chlorophyll-b, C 55 H 70 O 6 N 4 Mg, is a pigment found in all plants, green algae and some prokaryotes. Chlorophyll-b is blue-green in color with absorption peaks at approximately 453 nm and 642 nm, which, similarly to chlorophyll-a, represent blue and red light waves, respectively Carotenoids are another family of pigments found in all photosynthetic organisms, and appear red, yellow or orange in color. Carotenoids are accessory pigments in plants and work as adjuvant absorbers of light, by extending the range of wavelengths over which light can drive photosynthesis. The energy carotenoids absorb from light is transferred to the chlorophyll, which then uses the light energy in photosynthesis. In the fall, when chlorophyll is no longer present in leaves, carotenoids exist for a time. The presence of carotenoids without chlorophyll makes leaves appear yellow. Eventually, leaves that lack chlorophyll for an extended period of time will die. One of the most important carotenoids used in photosynthetic organisms is Beta-carotene, C 40 H 56 . The third major pigment in some plants are anthocyanins, which exhibit a red color and are seen in the fall. Anthocyanins form when concentrated sugars react with light and certain proteins in cell sap. On their own, land plants convert only about 2% to 4% of the available sunlight into glucose through the process of photosynthesis. As the density of certain pigments in plants increases, wavelengths of light are absorbed more efficiently and at a greater magnitude. Adding green pigment to green leaves increases the density of the green pigment in the leaves, which in turn increases light absorption. For example, plants that commonly grow in the shade have increased relative concentrations of green pigments, so they can more efficiently harvest sunlight at low light levels. In contrast, adding red or certain other pigments to green plants prevents the plant from absorbing solar energy at the wavelengths it needs for photosynthesis, thus reducing or inhibiting photosynthetic activity. Yellow pigments work in a similar fashion to red pigments, but because they are closer to green on the electromagnetic spectrum, yellow pigments do not block as much solar energy. Thus, when yellow pigments are applied to plants, the plants die more slowly than they would with the application of red pigments. Plants and other organisms that are not green will respond in a similar fashion with different pigments. Similarly, black pigment will absorb light and white pigment will reflect light in photosynthetic organisms. The present method relates to more efficient and potentially less expensive means to alter growth in photosynthetic organisms, such as plants, algae, and certain bacteria, by applying non-toxic, pigmented matter to the photosynthetic organism. Examples of such pigmented matter may include, but are not limited to, synthetic pigments and compounds that have been derived from plants, invertebrates, or minerals, including: vegetable dyes, food coloring, and plant pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, or flavonoids. It is an object of the present method to provide a solution to the human health and environmental problems associated with conventional fertilizers and pesticides used on lawns and on farms, as well as other places. It is another object of the present method to provide a simple, inexpensive solution to enhance crop growth internationally by providing a second use of existing product, such as food colorings, where the food colorings may be, but are not limited to, liquid, powder, gel, or pellet form. It is another object of the present method to enhance or increase the nutrients a plant produces by adding non-toxic and environment-friendly pigmented matter, such as food colorings, for example. It is yet another object of the present method to change or deepen the colors of flowers, fruits and vegetables by facilitating targeted photosynthesis with non-toxic and environment-friendly pigmented matter, such as food colorings for example, where the enzyme would be used as part of the product. It is yet another object of the present method to inhibit unwanted plant growth with non-toxic and environment-friendly pigmented matter, such as food colorings, for example."
9624437,Plant-based compositions and uses thereof,2016-06-20,1,1,"The present invention relates generally to compositions comprising plant material and methods for using the same. The methods include extracting a substance from a substrate and remediating a substrate from a substance, wherein the substance can comprise a protein, lipid, wax, fatty acid, fatty alcohol, hydrocarbon-containing substance, or a combination thereof.

BACKGROUND World petroleum supplies are finite. Thus, as world petroleum demand has increased (84,337 M bpd worldwide in 2009; US Energy Information Administration), easily accessible reserves have been depleted. Furthermore, much of the world's proven conventional petroleum reserves are located in regions which are politically unstable. Accordingly, supplies of petroleum from such regions might be uncertain since production of petroleum or the transportation of petroleum products from such regions might be interrupted. Bituminous sands, colloquially known as oil sands or tar sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. The sands typically comprise naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, water, and a dense and viscous form of petroleum known as bitumen. Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world's oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable oil sands to be profitably extracted and refined. Thus, oil sands are now a viable alternative to conventional crude oil. Oil sands might represent as much as two-thirds of the world's total “liquid” hydrocarbon resources, with at least 1.7 trillion recoverable BOE (barrel of oil equivalent) in the Canadian Athabasca oil sands alone. Extra-heavy oil and bitumen flow very slowly, if at all, toward oil-producing wells under normal reservoir conditions. Accordingly, in certain oil recovery operations from oil sands, the oil is made to flow into wells by using in situ techniques that reduce its viscosity by injecting steam, solvents, or hot air into the sands. These processes typically use large amounts of water and require large amounts of energy relative to conventional oil extraction. Further, typical extraction processes applied to oil sands generate significantly higher amounts of greenhouse gases per barrel relative to the production of conventional oils due to the increased energy requirements for recovery of oil from oil sands. In other oil sand mining operations, where oil sands are relatively close to the earth's surface, surface mining has been used to extract the oil contained therein. After removing the overburden (the soil covering the oil sands), the sands are mechanically excavated and transported to a refining facility. In one surface-mining method, after excavation, hot water and caustic soda (NaOH) are added to the sand. The resultant slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and oil is skimmed off the mixture. The combination of hot water, sodium hydroxide, a flocculant and agitation generally releases bitumen from the oil sand, and the oil floats to the top of separation vessels where it is separated. Then, the separated oil is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids before subsequent processing to convert the heavy oil to usable products. Such conventional processes to extract oil from oil sands also employ mixing the oil sand with high pH water, and then aerating the resultant mixture with air to produce froth (see, e.g., Masliyah, J.; Zhou, Z. J.; Xu, Z.; Czarnecki, J.; Hamza, H.: “Understanding water-based bitumen extraction from Athabasca oil sands.” The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering 2004, 82, (4), 628-654). A slurry of high pH water and oil sand is placed in a primary separation cell (PSC). Agitation and introduction of air assists in separating oil from the oil sand, and creates a froth in which the oil is entrained. The froth is removed, deaerated, and sent to feed tanks for further treatment. The remaining sand, comprising residual oil not removed in the PSC, is treated as “middlings” or as bottoms using the same process for extracting oil from oil sands in the PSC (i.e., high pH water and aeration). The froth from these subsequent processes is recycled to the PSC. The overall enhancement of oil from the oil in the froth is approximately 60% by mass over the iterative removal steps. About two tons of oil sands are required to produce one barrel (roughly ⅛ of a ton) of oil. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are typically transported back to the mine for disposal. However, even with improved extraction processes, up to 10% of the oil in the oil sands can be left in the resultant tailings. Thus, the process is inefficient. The tailings can contain significant amounts of oil and other pollutants which must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. In conventional oil sand mining operations, this has resulted in large lagoons containing high levels of oil and other pollutants. Accordingly, there is a need for improved compositions and methods for extraction of oil from oil sands that are more efficient (e.g., can remove higher amounts of oil), use less energy, and produce tailings that are environmentally benign. In addition, in conventional oil production processes, methods of enhancing oil recovery are known. These include, but are not limited to hydraulic fracturing of rock formations containing hydrocarbon deposits. In hydraulic fracturing operations, a fluid (e.g., water) which can comprise various additives (e.g., acids, rheology modifiers, detergents, gels, gas, proppant, etc.) is introduced into a rock formation under high pressure to fracture the rock formation. Such fracturing of a hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation effectively increases the surface area of rock exposed to a wellbore (i.e., along the fracture faces), and accordingly, allows more hydrocarbon to flow into the well bore. However, the viscosity of the oils contained in the formation can limit the utility of hydraulically fracturing rock formations which contain heavy oils. That is, if the viscosity of the oil is too high, increasing the surface area of the formation exposed to the well bore along the fracture might not significantly increase production rates. Accordingly, there is a need for hydraulic fracturing fluids which can enhance total oil recovery or increase oil production rates. In addition, remediation of environmentally compromised sites (e.g., hazardous waste sites) is an ongoing challenge. For example, there are many sites where hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil, coal tar, creosote, refined oil products) have been spilled or discharged into the environment. Such discharges can result in contamination of soil or water, and can contaminate groundwater supplies. Accordingly, such contaminated sites or waters (e.g., rivers, streams, ponds and harbors) require remediation to extract contaminants. There are several known remediation technologies. One method comprises excavation of contaminated soil. However, remediation by excavation has traditionally been a “dig and haul” process, wherein contaminated soils are excavated and disposed of in landfills or destroyed by thermal treatments such as incineration. In the case of landfill disposal of contaminated soil, the problem of soil contamination is not resolved as the soil is relocated and moved to another location. In the case of thermal desorption, the hydrocarbon or other pollutants can be destroyed, but typically produces a large carbon footprint, which, in and of itself, is not an environmentally friendly process, since energy is required and greenhouse gases are produced. Chemical treatment (e.g., oxidation) has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process comprises excavation of the contaminated soil, followed by chemical treatment to chemically modify or degrade the pollutants to potentially less toxic or hazardous forms. However, such methods can require large quantities of specialized chemicals to oxidize the contaminants, and can be ineffective at oxidizing certain pollutants. Another remediation method comprises injection of a material into the soil to sequester contaminants, with a goal of immobilizing them and preventing them from migrating. For example, stabilization/solidification (S/S) is a remediation or treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop, prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants. Stabilization comprises the addition of liquid or solid materials to contaminated soil to produce more chemically stable constituents. Solidification comprises the addition of liquid or solid reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical, for example, dimensional stability, so that they are constrained in a solid product and to reduce mobility of the contaminants. However, such methods might not be desirable since over time, the solids can break down or degrade, releasing the hydrocarbons or other pollutants back into the environment. Accordingly, there is a need for cost-effective methods for extracting contaminants (e.g., hydrocarbons) from soils and other substrates at environmentally compromised or contaminated sites and for sequestering contaminants in situ in a cost effective manner. There is also a need for improved compositions and methods for extracting or removing other undesirable substances from substrates, such as the removal of a protein, lipid, wax, fatty acid or fatty alcohol from a substrate such as fabric, skin or hair. For example, skin sebum contains bulky oils such as long chain fatty esters and triglycerides and can be difficult to remove. Sebum generally comprises a complex mixture of triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, sterol esters and free sterols produced by sebocytes (cells of the sebaceous glands in the skin) and secreted to the skin surface. An excessive amount of sebum on the skin can lead to undesirable skin effects. Similarly, an excessive amount of oils or grease in hair can lead to an undesirable appearance. Thus, there is a need for novel compositions and methods to remove excessive oils from the skin and hair. The present invention meets these needs and provides related advantages.

10273195,Method for the bioactivation of biochar for use as a soil amendment,2016-11-10,2,1,"The present invention relates generally to biofuel and more particularly to methods for the bioactivation of biochar for use as a soil amendment. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Negative carbon fuels are defined as fuels that are produced via a process that also sequesters some of the carbon contained in the carbon-containing feedstock used to produce the fuel. A similar and related concept is that of carbon negative fuels, which refer to fuels whose production removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than carbon dioxide emitted from combustion and carbon dioxide added from processes used to make the fuels. Both are possible if some of the carbon from a carbon-containing input (e.g. biomass) is removed to the ground in more or less permanent form, while the remaining carbon from the input is converted to fuel. The production of negative carbon fuels or carbon negative fuels is desirable because the biosphere is presently overburdened by carbon emissions produced from fossil fuels. The burning of fuels presently contributes to an annual release of 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and the injection of 2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the world's oceans. It has been well documented that these carbon emissions negatively impact living organisms in the oceans as well as on land. There is presently intense interest in producing biofuels from a wide variety of feedstocks, in order to provide suitable replacements for fossil fuels. In particular, it is desirable to combine biofuel production with carbon sequestration, yielding a negative carbon or carbon negative product. The idea of carbon negative fuels has been previously discussed. See, for example, J. A. Mathews, “ Carbon - negative biofuels”, in Energy Policy 36 (2008) pp. 940-945. Typical production of biofuels, however, utilizes pyrolysis processes which produce a resinous mixture of oil and carbon along with significant amounts of CO2. The gas streams that are produced are contaminated with various agents, such as sulfur. The carbon is also contaminated with tar products. It is desirable to find a process which produces negative carbon or carbon negative fuel in which the fuel and the carbon are produced as separate and uncontaminated products. Approaches directed toward the production of carbon negative fuels include those described in US Patent Publication 2010/0311157, which teaches the production of biofuels from algae as feedstock. The process is claimed to be carbon negative due to the high absorption of CO 2 by the algae. US Patent Publication 2010/0040510 discloses a multistage pressurized fluidized bed gasifier operating between 780° C. and 1100° C. that converts biomass to synthesis gas and biochar. The biochar is said to be capable of being added to soil. The formation of methane, gasoline-like volatiles such as BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) and tar is explicitly avoided. The gasifier is said to possibly produce carbon negative fuel. US Patent Publication 2008/0317657 discloses a system and method for sequestering carbon in the form of char created by gasifying biomass in an unspecified reactor vessel. A low heating value producer gas is a by-product of the process. US Patent Publication 2004/0111968 discusses pyrolyzing biomass to produce char and pyrolysis gases which are steam reformed to hydrogen. The char is treated to become a carbon based fertilizer. BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION In its most general form, the present invention discloses a method for making negative carbon fuel via the concurrent production of combustible fuels (and chemicals) and carbon in unmixed form from a carbon-containing input. In an embodiment of this invention, the carbon-containing input may include biomass. In another embodiment, the process may include a selective pyrolysis of biomass performed in a reactor, which may entail discrete increasing temperatures under pressure. This process is called biofractioning. One such reactor is described in detail in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/103,905, titled “Method for Biomass Fractioning by Enhancing Thermal Conductivity” and co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/019,236, titled “System and Method for Biomass Fractioning,” the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Another suitable reactor is an auger reactor, such as described herein. The carbon produced from this biofractioning process is sequestered. Using this process the resulting fuel is negative carbon. The fuel and the carbon arise separately and substantially uncontaminated, avoiding the resinous mixture of standard processes. In a still another embodiment, the biofractioning process produces carbon negative fuel. One embodiment of the invention is directed toward a method for enhancing soil growth using BMF char, comprising: rendering a surface of the BMF char hydrophilic; exposing the BMF char to microorganisms; and adding the BMF char to soil. In some embodiments, the method further comprises controlling a pH of the BMF char via pH adjustment agents. In other embodiments, the method also comprises activating the BMF char and/or modifying a pH of the soil to accept the addition of BMF char. The step of rendering a surface of the BMF char hydrophilic may comprise removing adsorbed gas within char pores and/or removing adsorbed hydrocarbons at a high temperature. This might entail: (i) removing adsorbed gases by water infiltration, vacuum suction, ultrasonic means, or impact means; or (ii) removing adsorbed gases by introducing a water solution containing soluble plant nutrients. In some embodiments, the microorganisms include members of at least one of fungi, bacteria or archaea. In certain embodiments the fungi include members of the phyla Glomeromycota. The BMF char can contain glomalin structures. A further embodiment of the invention involves a method for the production of an agent for enhancing soil growth, comprising: grinding a biomass feedstock to produce ground biomass particles; subjecting the ground biomass particles to a biofractioning process including an auger reactor; selectively collecting at least one volatile component as it is released from the ground biomass particles; collecting a last remaining nonvolatile component comprising BMF char; rendering a surface of the BMF char hydrophilic; exposing the BMF char to microorganisms; and adding the BMF char to soil. In the above method, the step of subjecting the ground biomass particles to a biofractioning process including an auger reactor can comprise: (i) feeding the ground biomass particles into a feeder of the auger reactor; (ii) conveying the biomass particles through the auger reactor; and (iii) heating the biomass particles as they are conveyed through the auger reactor. Additionally, conveying the biomass may comprise moving the biomass using a transfer screw powered by an external motor. Another embodiment of the invention is directed toward a method for making negative carbon fuel, comprising: concurrently converting a carbon-containing input to: (a) combustible fuels, refinery feedstock or chemicals; and (b) sequesterable carbon; wherein the combustible fuels, refinery feedstock or chemicals arise in substantially separate and uncontaminated form from the sequesterable carbon. In some cases, the carbon-containing input may comprise biomass. The step of converting the carbon-containing input may comprise, e.g., subjecting biomass to ramps of temperatures under pressure, wherein the pressure increases the thermal conductivity of the partially carbonized biomass. In one implementation, subjecting biomass to ramps of temperatures under pressure is performed using mobile equipment. The method may further comprise choosing a biomass conversion route based on a composition of the biomass and/or dispensing the biomass as thin sheets. In some embodiments, a ratio of sequesterable carbon to combustible fuel is controlled via selection of biomass feedstock or by selection of temperature ramp profile and pressure. By way of example, the sequesterable carbon may be sequestered by use as a soil amendment, by underground storage as coal, or by addition to soil containing compost material. The sequesterable carbon may be used for carbon offsets and/or carbon credits. According to one implementation, at least some of the sequesterable carbon is reacted with oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane or steam to generate synthesis gas. The synthesis gas may be converted to combustible fuels, refinery stock or chemicals. In some cases, at least one of the combustible fuels, refinery stock or chemicals is certified as carbon negative. The above method may further comprise blending the combustible stocks, refinery stock, or chemicals with one or more of: gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, light cycle oil, and heavy cycle oil. Additionally, the method may further comprise blending the combustible stocks, refinery stock, or chemicals with one or more of: methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, t-butanol, pentanol, hexanol, butanediol, dimethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), tertiary hexyl methyl ether (THEME), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and diisopropyl ether (DIPE). In further embodiments, the method may also comprise blending the combustible stocks, refinery stock, or chemicals with one or more of: detergent, combustion improver, cetane improver, emulsifier, antioxidant, antifoam agent, corrosion inhibitor, wax crystal modifier, icing inhibitor, lubricity agent and distillate flow improver. Another embodiment of the invention is directed toward an unleaded fuel blend produced according to the above method and suitable for combustion in an automobile or aviation engine, the fuel blend comprising: 0.5% or more of combustible fuel or refinery feedstock; and 99.5% or less of one or more of: gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, light cycle oil, and heavy cycle oil. Other features and aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the features in accordance with embodiments of the invention. The summary is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined solely by the claims attached hereto."
9903578,Air cooled horticulture lighting fixture for a double ended high pressure sodium lamp,2017-08-30,1,6,"Technical Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to horticulture light fixtures for growing plants indoors, and particularly to an air cooled fixture used in confined indoor growing spaces that burns a double ended high pressure sodium lamp. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED AND PRIOR ART Horticulture light fixtures used for growing plants in confined indoor spaces must provide adequate light to grow plants, while not excessively raising the temperature of the growing environment. Removal of the heat generated by the fixture is commonly achieved by forcing cooling air around the lamp and through the fixture, exhausting the same out of the growing environment. The air used for cooling the fixture is not mixed with the growing atmosphere, as the growing atmosphere is specially controlled and often enhanced with Carbon Dioxide to aid in plant development and health. Innovations in electronic ballast technology made feasible for use in the indoor garden industry an improved high pressure sodium ‘HPS’ grow lamp that is connected to power at each end of the lamp, thus the term “Double Ended”. The double ended lamp as powered from each end is also supported by sockets at each end, thereby eliminating the need for a frame support wire inside the lamp as required in standard single ended HPS lamps. The absence of frame wire eliminates shadows that commonly plague single ended HPS lamps. The double ended lamp further benefits from a smaller arc tube that is gas filled rather than vacuum encapsulated. The smaller arc tube equates to a smaller point source of light, thereby improving light projection control and photometric performance. The double ended HPS lamp proves to be more efficient than its single ended HPS lamp equivalent, last longer than like wattage HPS lamps, and produces more light in beneficial wavelength for growing plants than any single ended HPS lamps of the same light output rating. The double ended HPS lamp, with all of its light output performance advantages, has a significant particularity in operation, specifically when cooling the lamp. Operating temperatures at the lamp envelope surface must be maintained within a narrow operating range else the double ended HPS lamp's efficiencies in electrical power conversion into light energy are significantly reduced. When impacted by moving air, the double ended HPS lamp draws excessive electrical current which may cause failure or shutdown of the ballast powering the lamp. When bounded by stagnant air held at constant operating temperature the double ended HPS lamp proves more efficient in converting electricity to light energy and produces more light in the plant usable spectrum. This particularity in the double ended HPS lamp makes it an excellent grow lamp, but also thwarted earlier attempts to enclose, seal, and air cool the double ended HPS lamp to be used in confined indoor growing application due to the lamp's substantial sensitivity to moving cooling air. Another challenges not resolved by the prior art involves sealing the glass sheet to the bottom of the fixture. The reflector interior temperatures when burning a double ended HPS lamp cause failures of gasket materials. Further, the ultraviolet and infrared light energies produced by the double ended HPS lamp degrade and make brittle rubber, neoprene, and most other gasket materials suitable for sealing the glass sheet. Gavita, a lighting company from Holland produces various fixtures utilizing the double ended HPS lamp. The usual configuration includes a reflector with a spine, the spine having a socket on each opposing end such that the double ended lamp is suspended under a reflector over the plants. The reflector is not sealed from the growing environment, nor is there a housing enclosure or ducts to facilitate forced air cooling. The Gavita fixtures provide the benefit of the high performing double ended HPS lamp, but lacks air cooling capability which is necessary in many indoor growing applications as discussed above. Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that the prior art does not teach nor suggest an air cooled horticulture fixture for a double ended HPS lamp suitable for growing plants in confined indoor growing spaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing, one object of the present invention is to provide an air cooled double ended HPS lamp fixture for growing plants in confined indoor environments. A further object of this invention is to provide a fixture construct wherein the excessive heat generated by the lamp is removed using a stream of forced air. It is another object of the present invention to provide a stagnant air space around the lamp that is maintained at constant temperatures within the reflector during operation to prevent the lamp from drawing excessive current when subjected to temperatures differentials, or direct moving cooling air. Another object of the present invention is to provide a positive air tight seal between the fixture and the growing environment using a gasket that is protected from the lamp's damaging light. This invention further features turbulence enhancement of the cooling air stream by a diverter that disrupts the air stream creating eddies over the top of the reflector. Other objects, advantages, and features of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when contemplated with the accompanying drawings."
