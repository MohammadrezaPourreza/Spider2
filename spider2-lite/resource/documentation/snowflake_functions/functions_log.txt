##  Arguments  ¶

` _ base  _ `

    

The “base” to use (e.g. 10 for base 10 arithmetic).

This can be of any numeric data type (INTEGER, fixed-point, or floating
point).

` _ base  _ ` should be greater than 0.

` _ base  _ ` should not be exactly 1.0.

` _ expr  _ `

    

The value for which you want to know the log.

This can be of any numeric data type (INTEGER, fixed-point, or floating
point).

` _ expr  _ ` should be greater than 0.

##  Returns  ¶

Always returns a floating point number, even if one or more of the input
expressions are of type integer or fixed-point.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * If ` _ base  _ ` is 1 or less than or equal to 0, an error is returned. 

  * If ` _ expr  _ ` is less than or equal to 0, an error is returned. 

##  Examples  ¶
