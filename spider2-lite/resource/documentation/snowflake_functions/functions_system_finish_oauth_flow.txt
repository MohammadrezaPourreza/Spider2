  SYSTEM$FINISH_OAUTH_FLOW  ¶

Sets the OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN parameter value of the secret passed as an
argument in the [ SYSTEM$START_OAUTH_FLOW  ](system_start_oauth_flow) call
that began the OAuth flow.

This function completes the OAuth client flow begun with
SYSTEM$START_OAUTH_FLOW.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    SYSTEM$FINISH_OAUTH_FLOW( '<query_string>' )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` '  _ query_string  _ '  `

    

Query string from the URL in the browser after completing user authentication
and providing OAuth consent.

##  Usage notes  ¶

Use this function to set the refresh token of an OAuth2 secret you’re using to
authenticate with a service provider. This function finishes an OAuth flow
that must begin with your call to [ SYSTEM$START_OAUTH_FLOW
](system_start_oauth_flow) .

You must execute this function immediately after – and in the same session as
– SYSTEM$START_OAUTH_FLOW. This ensures that the user who is finishing the
flow is the same as the user who started it.

##  Examples  ¶

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$FINISH_OAUTH_FLOW('state=252462476&authz_code=54264262');
