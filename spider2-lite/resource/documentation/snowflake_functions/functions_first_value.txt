  FIRST_VALUE  ¶

Returns the first value within an ordered group of values.

See also:

    

[ LAST_VALUE  ](last_value) , [ NTH_VALUE  ](nth_value)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    FIRST_VALUE( <expr> ) [ { IGNORE | RESPECT } NULLS ]
                          OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr1> ] ORDER BY <expr2>  [ { ASC | DESC } ] [ <window_frame> ] )

For details about ` _ window_frame  _ ` syntax, see [ Usage notes for window
frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-frames) .

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ expr  _ `

    

The expression that determines the return value.

` _ expr1  _ `

    

The expression by which to partition the rows. You can specify a single
expression or a comma-separated list of expressions. For example:

    
    
    PARTITION BY column_1, column_2
    

Copy

` _ expr2  _ `

    

The expression by which to order the rows. You can specify a single expression
or a comma-separated list of expressions. For example:

    
    
    ORDER BY column_3, column_4

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * For compatibility with implementations of this function in other systems, ` {  IGNORE  |  RESPECT  }  NULLS  ` can also be specified in the arguments for the function: 

> ` FIRST_VALUE(  <expr> [  {  IGNORE  |  RESPECT  }  NULLS  ]  )  OVER  ...
> `

  * If ` {  IGNORE  |  RESPECT  }  NULLS  ` is not specified, the default is ` RESPECT  NULLS  ` (i.e. a NULL value will be returned if the expression contains a NULL value and it is the first value in the expression). 

  * This function is a rank-related function, so it must specify a window. A window clause consists of the following subclauses: 

>     * ` PARTITION  BY  <expr1> ` subclause (optional).
>
>     * ` ORDER  BY  <expr2> ` subclause (required). For details about
> additional supported ordering options (sort order, ordering of NULL values,
> etc.), see the documentation for the [ ORDER BY  ](../constructs/order-by)
> query construct, which follows the same rules.
>
>     * ` _ window_frame  _ ` subclause (optional).

  * The order of rows in a window (and thus the result of the query) is fully deterministic only if the keys in the ORDER BY clause make each row unique. Consider the following example: 
    
        ... OVER (PARTITION BY p ORDER BY o COLLATE 'lower') ...
    

Copy

The query result can vary if any partition contains values of column ` o  `
that are identical, or would be identical in a case-insensitive comparison.

  * The ORDER BY clause inside the OVER clause controls the order of rows only within the window, not the order of rows in the output of the entire query. To control output order, use a separate ORDER BY clause at the outermost level of the query. 

  * The optional ` _ window_frame  _ ` (cumulative or sliding) specifies the subset of rows within the window for which the function is calculated. If no ` _ window_frame  _ ` is specified, the default is the entire window: 

> ` ROWS  BETWEEN  UNBOUNDED  PRECEDING  AND  UNBOUNDED  FOLLOWING  `

Note that this deviates from the ANSI standard, which specifies the following
default for window frames:

> ` RANGE  BETWEEN  UNBOUNDED  PRECEDING  AND  CURRENT  ROW  `

For more details about window frames, including syntax and examples, see [
Usage notes for window frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-
frames) .

##  Examples  ¶

This shows a simple query using ` FIRST_VALUE()  ` . This query contains two `
ORDER  BY  ` sub-clauses, one to control the order of rows in each partition,
and one to control the order of the output of the full query.

    
    
    SELECT
            column1,
            column2,
            FIRST_VALUE(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 NULLS LAST) AS column2_first
        FROM VALUES
           (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, null), (1, 12),
           (2, 20), (2, 21), (2, 22)
        ORDER BY column1, column2;
    +---------+---------+---------------+
    | COLUMN1 | COLUMN2 | COLUMN2_FIRST |
    |---------+---------+---------------|
    |       1 |      10 |            10 |
    |       1 |      11 |            10 |
    |       1 |      12 |            10 |
    |       1 |    NULL |            10 |
    |       2 |      20 |            20 |
    |       2 |      21 |            20 |
    |       2 |      22 |            20 |
    +---------+---------+---------------+
    

Copy

The next query contrasts the outputs of ` FIRST_VALUE  ` , ` NTH_VALUE  ` ,
and ` LAST_VALUE  ` . Note that:

  * The query creates a sliding window frame that is 3 rows wide, which contains: 

    * The row that precedes the current row. 

    * The current row. 

    * The row that follows the current row. 

  * The ` 2  ` in the call ` NTH_VALUE(i,  2)  ` specifies the second row in the window frame (which, in this case, is also the current row). 

  * When the current row is the very first row in the window frame, there is no preceding row to reference, so ` FIRST_VALUE()  ` returns a NULL for that row.
