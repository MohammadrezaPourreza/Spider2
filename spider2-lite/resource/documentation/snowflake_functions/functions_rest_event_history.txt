  REST_EVENT_HISTORY  ¶

Returns a list of SCIM REST API requests made to Snowflake over a specified
time interval.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    REST_EVENT_HISTORY(
          REST_SERVICE_TYPE => 'scim'
          [, TIME_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
          [, TIME_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
          [, RESULT_LIMIT => <integer> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ REST_SERVICE_TYPE  _ => 'scim'  `

    

The type of REST API service. Currently, Snowflake only supports ` SCIM  ` .

**Optional:**

` _ TIME_RANGE_START  _ => <constant_expr> ` ,  .  ` _ TIME_RANGE_END  _ =>
<constant_expr> `

    

Time range (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format), within the last 7 days, in which the
login event occurred.

  * If ` _ TIME_RANGE_START  _ ` is not specified, all logs from the last seven days are returned. 

  * If ` _ TIME_RANGE_END  _ ` is not specified, all logs are returned. 

If the time range does not fall within the last 7 days, an error is returned.

For more information on functions that you can use, see [ Date & time
functions  ](../functions-date-time) .

` _ RESULT_LIMIT  _ => <integer> `

    

A number specifying the maximum number of rows returned by the function.

If the number of matching rows is greater than this limit, the queries with
the most recent end time (or those that are still executing) are returned, up
to the specified limit.

Range: ` 1  ` to ` 10000  `

Default: ` 100  ` .

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Currently, the REST_EVENT_HISTORY table function can only be used with [ SCIM  ](../../user-guide/scim-intro) . 

  * Only account administrators (i.e. users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) can obtain query results.
