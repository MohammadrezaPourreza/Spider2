  H3_TRY_COVERAGE  ¶

A special version of [ H3_COVERAGE  ](h3_coverage) that returns NULL if an
error occurs when it attempts to return an [ array  ](../data-types-
semistructured.html#label-data-type-array) of IDs (as INTEGER values)
identifying the minimal set of [ H3  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-
data-types-geospatial-h3) cells that completely cover a shape (specified by a
[ GEOGRAPHY  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography)
object).

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    H3_TRY_COVERAGE( <geography_expression> , <target_resolution> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ geography_expression  _ `

    

A GEOGRAPHY object.

` _ target_resolution  _ `

    

An INTEGER between 0 and 15 (inclusive) specifying the H3 [ resolution
](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable) that you want to use for the
returned H3 cells.

Specifying any other INTEGER value results in an error.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns an array of INTEGER values or NULL.

  * If the function can perform a successful calculation, returns an array of INTEGER values for the IDs of the minimal set of H3 cells that completely cover the specified input shape. 

  * If the function cannot perform a successful calculation, returns NULL without reporting an error. 

##  Usage notes  ¶

See [ H3_COVERAGE  ](h3_coverage) for the usage notes.

##  Examples  ¶

The following example attempts to return an array of IDs that identify the
minimal set of [ H3  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-
geospatial-h3) cells that completely cover a shape (specified by a [ GEOGRAPHY
](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography) object). Because
the array with the cells that cover the given hexagon at the given resolution
exceeds the allowed size limit, the function returns NULL.

    
    
    SELECT H3_TRY_COVERAGE(
      TO_GEOGRAPHY('POLYGON((-108.959 40.948,
                             -109.015 37.077,
                             -102.117 36.956,
                             -102.134 40.953,
                             -108.959 40.948))'
                  ), 15) AS set_of_h3_cells_covering_polygon;
