  TRY_DECRYPT  ¶

A special version of [ DECRYPT  ](decrypt) that returns a NULL value if an
error occurs during decryption.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    TRY_DECRYPT( <value_to_decrypt> , <passphrase> ,
             [ [ <additional_authenticated_data> , ] <encryption_method> ]
           )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ value_to_decrypt  _ `

    

The BINARY value to decrypt.

` _ passphrase  _ `

    

The passphrase to use to encrypt/decrypt the data. The passphrase is a
VARCHAR.

**Optional:**

` _ additional_authenticated_data  _ `

    

Additional authenticated data (AAD) is additional data whose confidentiality
and authenticity is assured during the decryption process. However, this AAD
is not encrypted and is not included as a field in the returned value from the
ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW function.

If AAD is passed to the encryption function (ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW), then the
same AAD must be passed to the decryption function (DECRYPT or DECRYPT_RAW).
If the AAD passed to the decryption function does not match the AAD passed to
the encryption function, then decryption fails.

The difference between the AAD and the ` _ passphrase  _ ` is that the
passphrase is intended to be kept secret (otherwise, the encryption is
essentially worthless) while the AAD can be left public. The AAD helps
authenticate that a public piece of information and an encrypted value are
associated with each other. The examples section in the [ ENCRYPT  ](encrypt)
function includes an example showing the behavior when the AAD matches and the
behavior when it doesn’t match.

For ENCRYPT_RAW and DECRYPT_RAW, the data type of the AAD should be BINARY.
For ENCRYPT and DECRYPT, the data type of the AAD can be either VARCHAR or
BINARY, and does not need to match the data type of the value that was
encrypted.

AAD is supported only by AEAD-enabled encryption modes like GCM (default).

` _ encryption_method  _ `

    

This string specifies the method to use for encrypting/decrypting the data.
This string contains subfields:

    
    
    <algorithm>-<mode> [ /pad: <padding> ]
    

Copy

The ` algorithm  ` is currently limited to:

>   * ` 'AES'  ` : When a passphrase is passed (e.g. to ENCRYPT), the function
> uses AES-256 encryption (256 bits). When a key is passed (e.g. to
> ENCRYPT_RAW), the function uses 128, 192, or 256-bit encryption, depending
> upon the key length.
>
>

The ` algorithm  ` is case-insensitive.

The ` mode  ` specifies which block cipher mode should be used to encrypt
messages. The following table shows which modes are supported, and which of
those modes support padding:

Mode

|

Padding

|

Description  
  
---|---|---  
  
` 'ECB'  `

|

Yes

|

Encrypt every block individually with the key. This mode is generally
discouraged and is included only for compatibility with external
implementations.  
  
` 'CBC'  `

|

Yes

|

The encrypted block is XORed with the previous block.  
  
` 'GCM'  `

|

No

|

Galois/Counter Mode is a high-performance encryption mode that is AEAD-
enabled. AEAD additionally assures the authenticity and confidentiality of the
encrypted data by generating an AEAD tag. Moreover, AEAD supports AAD
(additional authenticated data).  
  
` 'CTR'  `

|

No

|

Counter mode.  
  
` 'OFB'  `

|

No

|

Output feedback. The ciphertext is XORed with the plaintext of a block.  
  
` 'CFB'  `

|

No

|

Cipher feedback is a combination of OFB and CBC.  
  
The ` mode  ` is case-insensitive.

The ` padding  ` specifies how to pad messages whose length is not a multiple
of the block size. Padding is applicable only for ECB and CBC modes; padding
is ignored for other modes. The possible values for padding are:

>   * ` 'PKCS'  ` : Uses PKCS5 for block padding.
>
>   * ` 'NONE'  ` : No padding. The user needs to take care of the padding
> when using ECB or CBC mode.
>
>

The ` padding  ` is case-insensitive.

Default setting: ` 'AES-GCM'  ` .

If the ` mode  ` is not specified, GCM is used.

If the ` padding  ` is not specified, PKCS is used.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns the decrypted value as a BINARY value or a NULL value if any runtime
error occurs during decryption.
