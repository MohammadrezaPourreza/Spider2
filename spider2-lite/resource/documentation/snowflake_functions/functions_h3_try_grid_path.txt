  H3_TRY_GRID_PATH  ¶

A special version of [ H3_GRID_PATH  ](h3_grid_path) that returns NULL if an
error occurs when it attempts to return an array of VARIANT values that
contain the IDs of the [ H3  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-
geospatial-h3) cells that represent the line between two cells.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    H3_TRY_GRID_PATH( <cell_id_1> , <cell_id_2> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ cell_id_1  _ `

    

An INTEGER value that represents the H3 cell ID ( [ index
](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/h3Indexing) ), or a VARCHAR value that
represents the cell ID in hexadecimal format.

` _ cell_id_2  _ `

    

An INTEGER value that represents the H3 cell ID ( [ index
](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/h3Indexing) ), or a VARCHAR value that
represents the cell ID in hexadecimal format.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns a value of the ARRAY data type or NULL.

  * If the function performs a successful calculation, returns an array of VARIANT values that contain the IDs of H3 cells that represent the line between the cells specified by ` _ cell_id_1  _ ` and ` _ cell_id_2  _ ` . For information about the format of the IDs, see [ H3_GRID_PATH  ](h3_grid_path) . 

  * If the line cannot be calculated (for example, when two cells belong to non-neighboring [ base cells ](https://h3geo.org/docs/library/index/cell/) ), returns NULL without reporting an error. 

##  Usage notes  ¶

See [ H3_GRID_PATH  ](h3_grid_path) for the usage notes.

##  Examples  ¶

The following example attempts to return a line between two cells. Because the
cells belong to non-neighboring base cells, the function fails to return the
line and returns NULL.

    
    
    SELECT H3_TRY_GRID_PATH('813d7ffffffffff', '81343ffffffffff');
    

Copy

    
    
    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    | H3_TRY_GRID_PATH('813D7FFFFFFFFFF', '81343FFFFFFFFFF') |
    |--------------------------------------------------------|
    | NULL                                                   |
    +--------------------------------------------------------+
    

For examples that successfully calculate the path between two H3 cells, see [
H3_GRID_PATH  ](h3_grid_path) .
