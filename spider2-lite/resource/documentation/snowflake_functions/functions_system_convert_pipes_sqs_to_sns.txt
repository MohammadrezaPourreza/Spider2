##  Arguments  ¶

` _ bucket_name  _ `

    

Name of the S3 bucket.

` _ sns_topic_arn  _ `

    

ARN of Amazon SNS topic.

##  Access control requirements  ¶

Only account administrators can execute this function.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Before you call this function, update the access policy for your topic with the following permissions: 

    * Allow the Snowflake IAM user to subscribe the SQS queue that is in your _target_ account to your topic. 

    * Allow Amazon S3 to publish event notifications from your bucket to the SNS topic. 

For instructions, see [ Step 1: Subscribe the Snowflake SQS Queue to the SNS
Topic  ](../../user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-auto-s3.html#label-create-sns-
topic-subscription) .

  * Call this function _before_ you update your S3 bucket to send notifications to the SNS topic. 

  * To prevent any data loss, Snowpipe will continue to consume messages from the SQS queue. 

  * The S3 bucket and SNS topic must be in the same AWS region. 

##  Examples  ¶

Convert all notifications from bucket ` my_s3_bucket  ` :

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$CONVERT_PIPES_SQS_TO_SNS(
       'my_s3_bucket', 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:111122223333:sns_topic');
