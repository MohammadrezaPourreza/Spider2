  ALL_USER_NAMES  ¶

Returns all user names in the current account.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    ALL_USER_NAMES()
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

None.

##  Returns  ¶

The data type of the returned value is ` ARRAY  ` .

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Users with any active role can retrieve the list of all usernames in the current account. However, simply knowing the usernames does not allow a role the ability to perform further actions on the users. User management requires a minimum set of privileges. 

  * Usernames (i.e. the ` NAME  ` property value) are the unique identifier of the user object in Snowflake, while login names (i.e. the ` LOGIN_NAME  ` property value) are used to authenticate to Snowflake. Usernames are not sensitive data and are returned by other commands and functions (e.g. [ SHOW GRANTS  ](../sql/show-grants) ). Login names are sensitive data. 

  * As a best practice, username and login name values should be different. To update existing username or login name values, execute the [ ALTER USER  ](../sql/alter-user) command. When creating new users with the [ CREATE USER  ](../sql/create-user) command, ensure that the ` NAME  ` and ` LOGIN_NAME  ` values are different. 

##  Examples  ¶

Return all user names for the current account.
