  ARRAY_APPEND  ¶

Returns an array containing all elements from the source array as well as the
new element. The new element is located at end of the array.

See also:

    

[ ARRAY_INSERT  ](array_insert) , [ ARRAY_PREPEND  ](array_prepend)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    ARRAY_APPEND( <array> , <new_element> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ array  _ `

    

The source array.

` _ new_element  _ `

    

The element to be appended. The type of the element depends on the type of the
array:

  * If ` _ array  _ ` is a [ semi-structured ARRAY  ](../data-types-semistructured.html#label-data-type-array) , the element may be of almost any data type. The data type does not need to match the data type(s) of the existing elements in the array. 

  * If ` _ array  _ ` is a [ structured ARRAY  ](../data-types-structured) , the type of the new element must be [ coercible  ](../data-types-structured.html#label-structured-types-casting-implicit) to the type of the ARRAY. 

##  Returns  ¶

The data type of the returned value is ` ARRAY  ` .

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * When you pass a [ structured ARRAY  ](../data-types-structured) to the function, the function returns a structured ARRAY of the same type. 

##  Examples  ¶

This is a simple example of building an array (with the ` ARRAY_CONSTRUCT  `
function) and then appending to that array. Note that the appended element
does not need to be the same data type as the other elements in the array.

Execute the query:

>     SELECT ARRAY_APPEND(ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(1, 2, 3), 'HELLO');
>     +-------------------------------------------------+
>     | ARRAY_APPEND(ARRAY_CONSTRUCT(1, 2, 3), 'HELLO') |
>     |-------------------------------------------------|
>     | [                                               |
>     |   1,                                            |
>     |   2,                                            |
>     |   3,                                            |
