  SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION  ¶

For a previously executed query, this function returns a JSON object that
specifies if the query is eligible to benefit from the [ query acceleration
service  ](../../user-guide/query-acceleration-service) . If the query is
eligible for query acceleration, the output includes the estimated query
execution time for different query acceleration scale factors.

usage/query_acceleration_eligible)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION( '<query_id>' )
    

Copy

##  Parameters  ¶

` _ query_id  _ `

    

Query ID. Query ID must be for a query executed within the last 14 days;
otherwise, the ` status  ` is ` invalid  ` .

##  Output  ¶

The function returns a JSON object with the properties described below:

Property

|

Description  
  
---|---  
  
` estimatedQueryTimes  `

|

Object that contains the estimated query execution time in seconds for
different query acceleration scale factors. If the ` status  ` for the query
is  not  ` eligible  ` for query acceleration, this object is empty.  
  
` originalQueryTime  `

|

Execution time of the original query in seconds.  
  
` queryUUID  `

|

Query ID.  
  
` status  `

|

One of the following values that indicates whether or not the query is
eligible to benefit from the query acceleration service:

|

` eligible  `

|

The query can benefit from query acceleration.  
  
---|---  
  
` ineligible  `

|

The query cannot benefit from query acceleration.  
  
` accelerated  `

|

The query has already been accelerated.  
  
` invalid  `

|

The query with the specified ID was not found.  
  
` upperLimitScaleFactor  `

|

Number of the highest query acceleration scale factor in the `
estimatedQueryTimes  ` object. If the ` status  ` for the query is  not  `
eligible  ` for query acceleration, this field is set to ` 0  ` .  
  
In the ` estimatedQueryTimes  ` object, each name / value pair specifies a
query acceleration [ scale factor  ](../sql/create-warehouse.html#label-query-
acceleration-max-scale-factor) and the estimated query execution time at that
scale factor.

The following example lists the estimated query execution time for the scale
factors ` 1  ` , ` 2  ` , ` 4  ` and ` 8  ` :

    
    
    ...
    "estimatedQueryTimes" : {
      "1" : 171,
      "2": 152,
      "4": 133,
      "8": 120
    }
    ...
    

Copy

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Estimated query times are for analysis purposes only and are not guaranteed. 

  * Estimated query times are calculated based on the assumption that the query is serviced by all the compute resources allocated by the query acceleration service based on scale factor. 

  * Estimated query times do not factor in concurrency.
