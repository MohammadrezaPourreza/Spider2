  ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE  ¶

Returns the discrete [ Hausdorff distance
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance) between two [ GEOGRAPHY
](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography) objects.

The Hausdorff distance indicates how similar the two objects are. Two objects
are considered to be similar if each point in one object is close to a point
in the other object. The Hausdorff distance is the greatest distance between a
point in one object and a point in the other object.

ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE returns the discrete Hausdorff distance, which is
calculated by comparing only the vertices (discrete points) and not arbitrary
points along the edge.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ geography_expression_1  _ `

    

The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

` _ geography_expression_2  _ `

    

The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns a value of type REAL that represents the discrete Hausdorff distance
in degrees.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Returns NULL if one or more input points are NULL. 

##  Examples  ¶

This example returns the Hausdorff distance between two points (point ` 0  0
` and point ` 0  1  ` ):

>
>     SELECT ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE(ST_POINT(0, 0), ST_POINT(0, 1));
>     +------------------------------------------------------+
>     | ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE(ST_POINT(0, 0), ST_POINT(0, 1)) |
>     |------------------------------------------------------|
>     |                                                    1 |

The next example compares three Polygons ( ` a  ` , ` b  ` , and ` c  ` ).

The distance between the farthest points in ` a  ` and ` c  ` (point ` 0  1  `
and point ` 0  3  ` ) is greater than the distance between the farthest points
in ` a  ` and ` b  ` (point ` 1  0  ` and point ` 2  0  ` ).

As a result, the value returned by ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE is smaller for ` a  `
and ` c  ` . This indicates that ` a  ` and ` c  ` are more similar than ` a
` and ` b  ` .
