##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    SYSTEM$GET_COMPUTE_POOL_STATUS( '<computePoolName>' )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ computePoolName  _ `

    

Compute pool name.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns status information as a JSON object. The JSON fields are:

  * ` status  ` . Compute pool status. 

  * ` message  ` . Message relevant to the status, if any. Otherwise, this field is empty. 

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The current role must have the MONITOR privilege on the compute pool to get the status information. 

  * The ` message  ` in the response may mention capacity error. It means the instance type you requested is currently not available with the cloud provider. You can either try creating compute pool a few minutes later or choose another instance type. 

##  Examples  ¶

The following function retrieves status information for the “mypool” compute
pool.

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$GET_COMPUTE_POOL_STATUS('mypool');
    

Copy

Example outputs:

  * Compute pool is starting up. 
    
        {"status":"STARTING","message":"Compute pool is starting for last 2 minutes"}
    

Copy

  * Compute pool is active. 
    
        {"status":"ACTIVE","message":""}
