  VECTOR_L2_DISTANCE  ¶

Computes the L2 distance between two [ vectors  ](../../user-guide/snowflake-
cortex/vector-embeddings) .

L2 distance, also known as the Euclidean distance, is a measure of the
distance between two vectors in a vector space. The distance is calculated by
taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences of vector
elements. The distance can be a value of zero or higher. If the distance is
zero, the vectors are identical. The larger the distance, the farther apart
the vectors are.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    VECTOR_L2_DISTANCE( <vector>, <vector> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ vector  _ `

    

The [ VECTOR  ](../data-types-vector) value to calculate the distance from.

` _ vector  _ `

    

The VECTOR value to calculate the distance to.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns the distance between the two input vectors as a [ FLOAT  ](../data-
types-numeric.html#label-data-types-for-floating-point-numbers) value.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Due to computational optimizations in the vector comparison functions, floating-point errors may be slightly larger than usual (e.g. about 1e-4). 

##  Examples  ¶

This example uses the VECTOR_L2_DISTANCE function to determine which vectors
in the table are closest to each other between columns ` a  ` and ` b  ` :

    
    
    CREATE TABLE vectors (a VECTOR(FLOAT, 3), b VECTOR(FLOAT, 3));
    INSERT INTO vectors SELECT [1.1,2.2,3]::VECTOR(FLOAT,3), [1,1,1]::VECTOR(FLOAT,3);
    INSERT INTO vectors SELECT [1,2.2,3]::VECTOR(FLOAT,3), [4,6,8]::VECTOR(FLOAT,3);
    
    -- Compute the pairwise inner product between columns a and b
    SELECT VECTOR_L2_DISTANCE(a, b) FROM vectors;
