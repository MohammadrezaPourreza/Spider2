  TIMESTAMPDIFF  ¶

Calculates the difference between two date, time, or timestamp expressions
based on the specified date or time part. The function returns the result of
subtracting the second argument from the third argument.

Alternative for [ DATEDIFF  ](datediff) .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    TIMESTAMPDIFF( <date_or_time_part> , <date_or_time_expr1> , <date_or_time_expr2> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ date_or_time_part  _ `

    

The unit of time. Must be one of the values listed in [ Supported date and
time parts  ](../functions-date-time.html#label-supported-date-time-parts)
(e.g. ` month  ` ). The value can be a string literal or can be unquoted (e.g.
` 'month'  ` or ` month  ` ).

` _ date_or_time_expr1  _ ` , ` _ date_or_time_expr2  _ `

    

The values to compare. Must be a date, a time, a timestamp, or an expression
that can be evaluated to a date, a time, or a timestamp. The value ` _
date_or_time_expr1  _ ` is subtracted from ` _ date_or_time_expr2  _ ` .

##  Returns  ¶

Returns an integer representing the number of units (seconds, days, etc.)
difference between ` _ date_or_time_expr2  _ ` and ` _ date_or_time_expr1  _ `
.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Output values can be negative, for example, -12 days. 

  * ` _ date_or_time_expr1  _ ` and ` _ date_or_time_expr2  _ ` can be a date, time, or timestamp. 

  * The function supports units of years, quarters, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. 

  * ` _ date_or_time_part  _ ` must be one of the values listed in [ Supported date and time parts  ](../functions-date-time.html#label-supported-date-time-parts) . 

If ` _ date_or_time_part  _ ` is ` week  ` (or any of its variations), the
output is controlled by the [ WEEK_START  ](../parameters.html#label-week-
start) session parameter. For more details, including examples, see [ Calendar
weeks and weekdays  ](../functions-date-time.html#label-calendar-weeks-
weekdays) .

  * The unit (e.g. ` month  ` ) used to calculate the difference determines which parts of the DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP field are used to determine the result and thus determines the precision of the result. 

Smaller units are not used, so values are not rounded. For example, even
though the difference between January 1, 2021 and February 28, 2021 is closer
to two months than to one month, the following returns one month:

    
        DATEDIFF(month, '2021-01-01'::DATE, '2021-02-28'::DATE)

For a DATE value:

>     * ` year  ` uses only the year and disregards all the other parts.
>
>     * ` month  ` uses the month and year.
>
>     * ` day  ` uses the entire date.

For a TIME value:

>     * ` hour  ` uses only the hour and disregards all the other parts.
>
>     * ` minute  ` uses the hour and minute.
>
>     * ` second  ` uses the hour, minute, and second, but not the fractional
> seconds.
>
>     * ` millisecond  ` uses the hour, minute, second, and first three digits
> of the fractional seconds. Fractional seconds are not rounded. For example,
> ` DATEDIFF(milliseconds,  '2024-02-20  21:18:41.0000',  '2024-02-20
> 21:18:42.1239')  ` returns 1.123 seconds, not 1.124 seconds.
>
>     * ` microsecond  ` uses the hour, minute, second, and first six digits
> of the fractional seconds. Fractional seconds are not rounded.
>
>     * ` nanosecond  ` uses the hour, minute, second, and all nine digits of
> the fractional seconds.

For a TIMESTAMP value:

> The rules match the rules for DATE and TIME data types above. Only the
> specified unit and larger units are used.

##  Examples  ¶

For example(s), see [ DATEDIFF  ](datediff) . (DATEDIFF, TIMEDIFF, and
TIMESTAMPDIFF all use the same basic format.)
