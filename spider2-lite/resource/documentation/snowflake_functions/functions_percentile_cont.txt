  PERCENTILE_CONT  ¶

Return a percentile value based on a continuous distribution of the input
column (specified in ` _ order_by_expr  _ ` ). If no input row lies exactly at
the desired percentile, the result is calculated using linear interpolation of
the two nearest input values. NULL values are ignored in the calculation.

[ PERCENTILE_DISC  ](percentile_disc)

##  Syntax  ¶

**Aggregate function**

    
    
    PERCENTILE_CONT( <percentile> ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <order_by_expr>)

**Window function**

    
    
    PERCENTILE_CONT( <percentile> ) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY <order_by_expr>) OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr3> ] )

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ percentile  _ `

    

The percentile of the value that you want to find. The percentile must be a
constant between 0.0 and 1.0. For example, if you want to find the value at
the 90th percentile, specify 0.9.

` _ order_by_expr  _ `

    

The expression (typically a column name) by which to order the values. For
example, if you want to want to find the student whose math SAT score is at
the 90th percentile, then specify the column containing the math SAT score.

Note that this is also implicitly the column from which the returned value is
chosen. For example, if you order by math SAT scores, then the result is one
of the math SAT scores. You cannot order by one column and get a percentile
value for a different column.

` _ expr3  _ `

    

This is the optional expression used to group rows into partitions.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns the value that is at the specified percentile. If no input row lies
exactly at the desired percentile, the result is calculated using linear
interpolation of the two nearest input values.

Note

If a group contains only one value, then that value will be returned for  any
specified percentile (e.g. both percentile 0.0 and percentile 1.0 will return
that one row).

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The ` _ percentile  _ ` argument to the function must be a constant. 

  * DISTINCT is not supported for this function. 

  * The function ` PERCENTILE_CONT  ` interpolates between the two closest values, while the function ` PERCENTILE_DISC  ` chooses the closest value rather than interpolating. 

  * When used as a window function: 

>     * This function does not support:
>

>>       * ORDER BY sub-clause in the OVER() clause.

>>

>>       * Window frames.

##  Examples  ¶

The following example shows the values at the 25th percentile (0.25) within
various groups:

>>     create or replace table aggr(k int, v decimal(10,2));

>>     insert into aggr (k, v) values

>>         (0, 10),

>>         (0, 20),

>>         (0, 30),

>>         (2, 25),

>>         (2, 30),

>>         (3, 60),
