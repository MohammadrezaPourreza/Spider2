  ASCII  ¶

Returns the ASCII code for the first character of a string. If the string is
empty, a value of ` 0  ` is returned.

> [ CHAR  ](chr) , [ UNICODE  ](unicode)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    ASCII( <input> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ input  _ `

    

The string for which the ASCII code for the first character in the string is
returned.

##  Returns  ¶

The value is an integer that is the numeric representation of the ASCII
character. For example, if the input is the letter ‘a’, then the return value
is 97.

##  Usage notes  ¶

The value 0 is returned for  either  of the following cases:

  * The first character of the string contains the ASCII character corresponding to 0. 

  * The string is empty. 

To distinguish between these two cases, use the LENGTH function to determine
whether the string is empty.

##  Examples  ¶

This example demonstrates the behavior for single ASCII characters, as well as
special cases, such as multi-character strings, empty strings, and NULL
values:

>
>     SELECT column1, ASCII(column1)
>       FROM (values('!'), ('A'), ('a'), ('bcd'), (''), (null));
>     +---------+----------------+
>     | COLUMN1 | ASCII(COLUMN1) |
>     |---------+----------------|
>     | !       |             33 |
>     | A       |             65 |
>     | a       |             97 |
>     | bcd     |             98 |
>     |         |              0 |
>     | NULL    |           NULL |
>     +---------+----------------+
