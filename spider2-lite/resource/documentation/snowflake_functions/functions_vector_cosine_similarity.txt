  VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY  ¶

Computes the cosine similarity between two [ vectors  ](../../user-
guide/snowflake-cortex/vector-embeddings) .

Cosine similarity is based on the angle between two vectors in a multi-
dimensional space; the magnitude of the vectors is not considered. The cosine
similarity value is the inner product of the vectors divided by the product of
their lengths. The cosine similarity is always in the interval ` [-1,  1]  ` .
For example, identical vectors have a cosine similarity of ` 1  ` , two
orthogonal vectors have a similarity of ` 0  ` , and two opposite vectors have
a similarity of ` -1  ` .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY( <vector>, <vector> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ vector  _ `

    

The [ VECTOR  ](../data-types-vector) value to calculate the angle from.

` _ vector  _ `

    

The VECTOR value to calculate the angle to.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns a [ FLOAT  ](../data-types-numeric.html#label-data-types-for-floating-
point-numbers) value, in the interval ` [-1,  1]  ` which indicates the cosine
similarity between the two input vectors.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Due to computational optimizations in the vector comparison functions, floating-point errors may be slightly larger than usual (e.g. about 1e-4). 

##  Examples  ¶

This example calls the VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY function to find the vector
closest to ` [1,2,3]  ` .

    
    
    SELECT a, VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY(a, [1,2,3]::VECTOR(FLOAT, 3)) AS similarity
      FROM vectors
      ORDER BY similarity DESC
      LIMIT 1;
