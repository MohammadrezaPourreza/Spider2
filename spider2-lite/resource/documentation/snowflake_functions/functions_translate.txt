  TRANSLATE  ¶

The ` TRANSLATE()  ` function replaces characters in a string. Specifically,
given a string, a set of characters to replace, and the characters to
substitute for the original characters, ` TRANSLATE()  ` makes the specified
substitutions.

Attention

This function does not translate between languages. See the [ TRANSLATE
(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX)  ](translate-snowflake-cortex) function for translating
text between natural languages.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    TRANSLATE( <subject>, <sourceAlphabet>, <targetAlphabet> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ subject  _ `

    

A string expression that is translated. If a character in ` subject  ` is not
contained in ` _ sourceAlphabet  _ ` , the character is added to the result
without any translation.

` _ sourceAlphabet  _ `

    

A string with all characters that are modified by this function. Each
character is either translated to the corresponding character in the ` _
targetAlphabet  _ ` or omitted in the result if the ` _ targetAlphabet  _ `
has no corresponding character (i.e. has fewer characters than the ` _
sourceAlphabet  _ ` ).

` _ targetAlphabet  _ `

    

A string with all characters that are used to replace characters from the ` _
sourceAlphabet  _ ` .

If ` _ targetAlphabet  _ ` is longer than ` _ sourceAlphabet  _ ` , Snowflake
reports the error ` String  '(target  alphabet)'  is  too  long  and  would
be  truncated.  ` .

##  Collation details  ¶

Arguments with collation specifications are currently not supported.

##  Examples  ¶

Translate the character ‘ñ’ to ‘n’.

>
>     SELECT TRANSLATE('peña','ñ','n');
>     +---------------------------+
>     | TRANSLATE('PEÑA','Ñ','N') |
>     |---------------------------|
>     | pena                      |

Translate ‘X’ to ‘c’, ‘Y’ to ‘e’, ‘Z’ to ‘f’ and remove ‘❄’ characters:

>
>     SELECT TRANSLATE('❄a❄bX❄dYZ❄','XYZ❄','cef');
>     +--------------------------------------+
>     | TRANSLATE('❄A❄BX❄DYZ❄','XYZ❄','CEF') |
>     |--------------------------------------|
>     | abcdef                               |
