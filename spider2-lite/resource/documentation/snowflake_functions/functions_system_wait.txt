  SYSTEM$WAIT  ¶

Waits for the specified amount of time before proceeding.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    SYSTEM$WAIT( amount [ , time_unit ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ amount  _ `

    

Number specifying the amount of time to wait as determined by ` _ time_unit  _
` .

**Optional:**

` _ time_unit  _ `

    

Time unit for ` _ amount  _ ` . Accepted values are DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES,
SECONDS, MILLISECONDS, MICROSECONDS, NANOSECONDS. The unit should be in single
quotes (see  Examples  below).

Default: SECONDS

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The function must be called as a system function. 

  * Most systems do not have clocks that have nanosecond precision. As a result: 

>     * The actual wait time might not be exactly the same as the specified
> wait time.
>
>     * The reported wait time might not be exact.

  * SYSTEM$WAIT checks periodically for cancellation. If a user cancels a query while it is waiting, there might be a delay between the time the query is cancelled and the time the cancellation takes effect. 

  * If the wait period exceeds the compilation timeout, the query is not cancelled automatically. After the wait, the query resumes normally.
