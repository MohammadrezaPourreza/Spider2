  NTILE  ¶

Divides an ordered data set equally into the number of buckets specified by `
_ constant_value  _ ` . Buckets are sequentially numbered 1 through ` _
constant_value  _ ` .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    NTILE( <constant_value> ) OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr1> ] ORDER BY <expr2> [ { ASC | DESC } ] )

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ constant_value  _ `

    

The desired number of buckets; must be a positive integer value.

` _ expr1  _ `

    

If you wish to partition the data into groups, specify the criterion (usually
a column) to partition by. For example, you might partition by province.

` _ expr2  _ `

    

The expression (usually a column) by which to order the rows in the window.
For example, you might order by timestamp.

##  Usage notes  ¶

If the data is partitioned, then the data is divided into buckets equally
within each partition. For example, if the number of buckets is 3, and if the
data is partitioned by province, then approximately 1/3 of the rows for each
province are put into each bucket.

If the statement has an ORDER BY clause for the output, as well as an ORDER BY
clause for the NTILE function, the two operate independently; the ORDER BY for
the NTILE function influences which rows are assigned to each bucket, while
the ORDER BY for the output determines the order in which the output rows are
shown.

##  Examples  ¶

    
    
    SELECT
      exchange,
      symbol,
      NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY exchange ORDER BY shares) AS ntile_4
    FROM trades
    ORDER BY exchange, NTILE_4;
