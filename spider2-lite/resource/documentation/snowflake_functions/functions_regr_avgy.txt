  REGR_AVGY  ¶

Returns the average of the dependent variable for non-null pairs in a group,
where ` x  ` is the independent variable and ` y  ` is the dependent variable.

##  Syntax  ¶

**Aggregate function**

    
    
    REGR_AVGY(y, x)
    

Copy

**Window function**

    
    
    REGR_AVGY(y, x) OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr3> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ y  _ `

    

The dependent variable. This must be an expression that can be evaluated to a
numeric type.

` _ x  _ `

    

The independent variable. This must be an expression that can be evaluated to
a numeric type.

` _ expr3  _ `

    

This is the optional expression used to group rows into partitions.

Important

Note the order of the arguments; the dependent variable is first.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * DISTINCT is not supported for this function. 

  * In order for a row to be included in the average, BOTH the x and y values must be non-NULL. 

  * When used as a window function: 

>     * This function does not support:
>

>>       * ORDER BY sub-clause in the OVER() clause.

>>

>>       * Window frames.

##  Examples  ¶

    
    
    create or replace table aggr(k int, v decimal(10,2), v2 decimal(10, 2));
    insert into aggr values(1, 10, null);
    insert into aggr values(2, 10, 11), (2, 20, 22), (2, 25,null), (2, 30, 35);
    

Copy

    
    
    select k, regr_avgy(v, v2) from aggr group by k;
    
    ---+------------------+
     k | regr_avgy(v, v2) |
    ---+------------------+
     1 | [NULL]           |
     2 | 20               |
    ---+------------------+
