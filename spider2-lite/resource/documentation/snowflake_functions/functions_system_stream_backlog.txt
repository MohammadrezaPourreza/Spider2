  SYSTEM$STREAM_BACKLOG  ¶

Returns the set of table versions between the current [ offset  ](../../user-
guide/streams-intro.html#label-streams-introduction-offset) for a specified
stream and the current timestamp. This function accepts any stream type as
input (e.g. table, external table, or view) with the exception of streams on
directory tables.

For each table version, the function provides the estimated number of change
data capture (CDC) records that comprise the table version, as well as the DML
operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE) associated with the table
version.

Use this function to analyze the volume of CDC records generated for each
stream, enabling you to estimate the compute resources required for a task to
process the records.

##  Syntax  ¶

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ stream_name  _ `

    

The name of the stream to query.

  * If the stream name is case-sensitive or includes any special characters or spaces, double quotes are required to process the case/characters. The double quotes must be enclosed within the single quotes, i.e. ` '"<stream_name>"'  ` . 

##  Usage notes  ¶

N/A

##  Examples  ¶

Retrieve the current set of unconsumed table versions for stream `
