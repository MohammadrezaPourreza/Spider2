  VARIANCE , VARIANCE_SAMP  ¶

Returns the sample variance of non-NULL records in a group. If all records
inside a group are NULL, a NULL is returned.

Aliases:

    

[ VAR_SAMP  ](var_samp)

##  Syntax  ¶

**Aggregate function**

    
    
    VARIANCE( [ DISTINCT ] <expr1> )
    

Copy

**Window function**

    
    
    VARIANCE( [ DISTINCT ] <expr1> ) OVER (
                                          [ PARTITION BY <expr2> ]
                                          [ ORDER BY <expr3> [ ASC | DESC ] [ <window_frame> ] ]
                                          )
    

Copy

frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-frames) .

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ expr1  _ `

    

The ` _ expr1  _ ` should evaluate to one of the numeric data types.

` _ expr2  _ `

    

This is the expression to partition by.

` _ expr3  _ `

    

This is the expression to order by within each partition.

##  Returns  ¶

The data type of the returned value is ` NUMBER(<precision>,  <scale>)  ` .
The scale depends upon the values being processed.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * For single-record inputs, VAR_SAMP, VARIANCE, and VARIANCE_SAMP all return NULL. This is different from the Oracle behavior, where VAR_SAMP returns NULL for a single record and VARIANCE returns 0. 

  * When passed a VARCHAR expression, this function implicitly casts the input to floating point values. If the cast cannot be performed, an error is returned. 

  * When this function is called as a window function with an OVER clause that contains an ORDER BY clause: 

    * A window frame is required. If no window frame is specified explicitly, the following implied window frame is used: 

` RANGE  BETWEEN  UNBOUNDED  PRECEDING  AND  CURRENT  ROW  `

For information about window frames, including syntax and examples, see [
Usage notes for window frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-
frames) .

    * Using the keyword DISTINCT inside the window function is prohibited and results in a compile-time error.
