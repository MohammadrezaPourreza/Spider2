  PERCENT_RANK  ¶

Returns the relative rank of a value within a group of values, specified as a
percentage ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr1> ] ORDER BY <expr2> [ { ASC | DESC } ] [ <cumulativeRangeFrame> ] )

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * ` _ expr1  _ ` specifies the column (or expression) to partition by. 

For example, suppose that within each state or province, you want to rank
farmers in order by the amount of corn they produced. In this case, you
partition by state.

If you want only a single group (e.g. you want to rank all farmers in the U.S.
regardless of which state they live in), then omit the ` PARTITION  BY  `
clause.

  * ` _ expr2  _ ` specifies the column (or expression) that you want to rank by. 

For example, if you’re ranking farmers to see who produced the most corn
(within their state), then you would use the ` bushels_produced  ` column. For
details, see  Examples  (in this topic).

  * PERCENT_RANK is calculated as: 

> If n is 1:
>

>> ` PERCENT_RANK  =  0  `

>
> If n is greater than 1:
>

>> ` PERCENT_RANK  =  (r  -  1)  /  (n  -  1)  `

>
> where ` r  ` is the [ RANK  ](rank) of the row and ` n  ` is the number of
> rows in the window partition.

  * Values range from 0.0 to 1.0. You can multiply by 100 to get a true percent. 

  * PERCENT_RANK supports range-based cumulative [ window frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-what-is-a-window-frame) , but not other types of window frames. For more information about the syntax for range-based cumulative window frames, see [ Usage notes for window frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-frames) .
