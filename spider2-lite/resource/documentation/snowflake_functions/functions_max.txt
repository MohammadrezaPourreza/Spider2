  MAX  ¶

Returns the maximum value for the records within ` _ expr  _ ` . NULL values
are ignored unless all the records are NULL, in which case a NULL value is
returned.

[ COUNT  ](count) , [ SUM  ](sum) , [ MIN  ](min)

##  Syntax  ¶

**Aggregate function**

    
    
    MAX( <expr> )
    

Copy

**Window function**

    
    
    MAX( <expr> ) [ OVER ( [ PARTITION BY <expr1> ] [ ORDER BY <expr2> [ <window_frame> ] ] ) ]
    

Copy

For details about ` _ window_frame  _ ` syntax, see [ Usage notes for window
frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-frames) .

##  Returns  ¶

The data type of the returned value is the same as the data type of the input
values.

##  Usage Notes  ¶

  * For compatibility with other systems, you can specify the DISTINCT keyword as an argument for the function, but it does not have any effect. 

  * If the function is called as a window function, the window can include an optional ` _ window_frame  _ ` . The ` _ window_frame  _ ` (either cumulative or sliding) specifies the subset of rows within the window for which the summed values are returned. If no ` _ window_frame  _ ` is specified, the default is the following cumulative window frame (in accordance with the ANSI standard for window functions): 

> ` RANGE  BETWEEN  UNBOUNDED  PRECEDING  AND  CURRENT  ROW  `

For more details about window frames, including syntax and examples, see [
Usage notes for window frames  ](../functions-analytic.html#label-window-
frames) .

##  Collation Details  ¶

  * The comparisons follow the collation based on the input arguments’ collations and precedences. 

  * The collation of the result is the same as the collation of the input. 

##  Examples  ¶

The following examples demonstrate how to use the MAX function.

> Create a table and data:

>>     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sample_table(k CHAR(4), d CHAR(4));

>>  
>>     INSERT INTO sample_table VALUES

>>         ('1', '1'), ('1', '5'), ('1', '3'),

>>         ('2', '2'), ('2', NULL),

>>         ('3', NULL),

>>         (NULL, '7'), (NULL, '1');

>>  
>>

>> Copy

> Display the data:
