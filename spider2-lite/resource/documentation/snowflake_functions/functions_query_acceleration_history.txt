[ ![Snowflake logo in black \(no text\)](../../_images/logo-snowflake-

Feature  ](../../user-guide/intro-editions)

The [ query acceleration service  ](../../user-guide/query-acceleration-
service) requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading,
please contact [ Snowflake Support ](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-
guide/contacting-support) .

The QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY function is used for querying the [ query
acceleration service  ](../../user-guide/query-acceleration-service) history
within a specified date range. The information returned includes the credits
used for the query acceleration service at the warehouse level for a given
time frame.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    QUERY_ACCELERATION_HISTORY(
          [ DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
          [ , DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
          [ , WAREHOUSE_NAME => '<string>' ] )
    

Copy

##  Parameters  ¶

All the arguments are optional.

` DATE_RANGE_START  => _ constant_expr  _ ` ,  .  ` DATE_RANGE_END  => _
constant_expr  _ `

    

The date/time range to display the query acceleration history.

For example, if you specify that the start date is 2019-05-03 and the end date
2019-05-05, you will get data for May 3, May 4, and May 5. (The endpoints are
included.)

  * If neither a start date nor an end date is specified, the default will be the last 12 hours. 

  * If an end date is not specified, but a start date is specified, then [ CURRENT_DATE  ](current_date) at midnight is used as the end of the range. 

  * If a start date is not specified, but an end date is specified, then the range starts 12 hours prior to the start of ` DATE_RANGE_END  ` . 

` WAREHOUSE_NAME  => _ string  _ `

    

Warehouse name. If specified, only shows the history for the specified
warehouse.

If a warehouse name is not specified, then the results will include history
for each warehouse using the query acceleration service.
