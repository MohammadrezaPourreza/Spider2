  LAST_QUERY_ID  ¶

Returns the ID of a specified query in the current session. If no query is
specified, the most recently-executed query is returned.

[ RESULT_SCAN  ](result_scan)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    LAST_QUERY_ID( [ <num> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ num  _ `

    

Specifies the query to return, based on the position of the query (within the
session).

Default: ` -1  `

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Positive numbers start with the first query executed in the session. For example: 

>     * ` LAST_QUERY_ID(1)  ` returns the first query.
>
>     * ` LAST_QUERY_ID(2)  ` returns the second query.
>
>     * ` LAST_QUERY_ID(6)  ` returns the sixth query.
>
>     * Etc.

  * Negative numbers start with the most recently-executed query in the session. For example: 

>     * ` LAST_QUERY_ID(-1)  ` returns the most recently-executed query
> (equivalent to ` LAST_QUERY_ID()  ` ).
>
>     * ` LAST_QUERY_ID(-2)  ` returns the second most recently-executed
> query.
>
>     * Etc.

##  Examples  ¶

>
>     SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID();
