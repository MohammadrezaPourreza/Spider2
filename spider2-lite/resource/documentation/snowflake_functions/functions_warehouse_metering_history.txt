  WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  ¶

This table function can be used in queries to return the hourly credit usage
for a single warehouse (or all the warehouses in your account) within a
specified date range.

Note

This function returns credit usage within the last 6 months. However, if you
are querying multiple warehouses over a lengthy time period, it might not
return a complete data set. To obtain a complete data set, use the [
ACCOUNT_USAGE view  ](../account-usage/warehouse_metering_history) instead.

[ WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY  ](warehouse_load_history)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY(
          DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr>
          [ , DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
          [ , WAREHOUSE_NAME => '<string>' ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` DATE_RANGE_START  => _ constant_expr  _ `

    

The starting date, within the last 6 months, for which warehouse usage is
returned.

**Optional:**

` DATE_RANGE_END  => _ constant_expr  _ `

    

The ending date, within the last 6 months, for which warehouse usage is
returned.

Default: [ CURRENT_DATE  ](current_date) is used.

` WAREHOUSE_NAME  => '  _ string  _ '  `

    

The name of the warehouse to retrieve credit usage for. Note that the
warehouse name must be enclosed in single quotes. Also, if the warehouse name
any spaces, mixed-case characters, or special characters, the name must be
double-quoted within the single quotes (e.g. ` '"My  Warehouse"'  ` vs `
'mywarehouse'  ` ).

Default: All warehouses that ran during the specified date range.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role or any role that has been explicitly granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege. 

  * When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use  or  the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [ Snowflake Information Schema  ](../info-schema) . 

  * The order and structure of the arguments depends on whether the argument keywords (e.g. ` DATE_RANGE_START  ` ) are included: 

    * The keywords are not required if the arguments are specified in order. 

    * If the argument keywords are included, the arguments can be specified in any order.
