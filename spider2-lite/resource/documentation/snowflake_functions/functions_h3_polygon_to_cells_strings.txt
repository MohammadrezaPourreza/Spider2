  H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS  ¶

Returns an [ array  ](../data-types-semistructured.html#label-data-type-array)
of VARCHAR values of the hexadecimal IDs of [ H3  ](../data-types-
geospatial.html#label-data-types-geospatial-h3) cells that have centroids
contained by a Polygon (specified by a [ GEOGRAPHY  ](../data-types-
geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography) object).

H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS  , [ H3_COVERAGE_STRINGS  ](h3_coverage_strings)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS( <geography_polygon> , <target_resolution> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ geography_polygon  _ `

    

A GEOGRAPHY object that represents a Polygon.

` _ target_resolution  _ `

    

An INTEGER between 0 and 15 (inclusive) that specifies the H3 [ resolution
](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable) that you want to use for the
returned H3 cells.

Specifying any other INTEGER value results in an error.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns an array of VARCHAR values for the hexadecimal IDs of the H3 cells
that have centroids contained in the specified input Polygon.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The function uses planar approximation, which treats points on the Earth’s surface as if they were connected by straight lines, rather than curved arcs. If you need a spherical approximation, use [ H3_COVERAGE_STRINGS  ](h3_coverage_strings) instead. 

  * A cell is considered to be within the Polygon if its centroid is contained by the Polygon. 

##  Examples  ¶

The following example returns an ARRAY of VARCHAR values representing the
hexadecimal IDs of H3 cells that have centroids contained in the specified
Polygon.

    
    
    SELECT H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS_STRINGS(
      TO_GEOGRAPHY(
        'POLYGON((-122.481889 37.826683,-122.479487 37.808548,-122.474150 37.808904,-122.476510 37.826935,-122.481889 37.826683))'),
      9) AS h3_cells_in_polygon;
