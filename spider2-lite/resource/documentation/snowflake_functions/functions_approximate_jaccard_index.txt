  APPROXIMATE_JACCARD_INDEX  ¶

Returns an estimation of the similarity (Jaccard index) of inputs based on
their MinHash states. For more information about Jaccard indexes and the
related function [ MINHASH  ](minhash) , see [ Estimating Similarity of Two or
More Sets  ](../../user-guide/querying-approximate-similarity) .

Alias for [ APPROXIMATE_SIMILARITY  ](approximate_similarity)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    APPROXIMATE_JACCARD_INDEX( [ DISTINCT ] <expr> [ , ... ] )
    
    APPROXIMATE_JACCARD_INDEX(*)

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ expr  _ `

    

The expression(s) should be one or more MinHash states returned by calls to
the [ MINHASH  ](minhash) function. In other words, the expressions must be `
MinHash  ` state information, not the column or expression for which you want
the approximate similarity. (The example below helps make this clear.)

For more information about MinHash states, see [ Estimating Similarity of Two
or More Sets  ](../../user-guide/querying-approximate-similarity) .

##  Returns  ¶

A floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), where 1.0 indicates
that the sets are identical, and 0.0 indicates that the sets have no overlap.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * ` DISTINCT  ` can be included as an argument, but has no effect. 

  * The input MinHash states must have MinHash arrays of equal length. 

  * The array length of the input MinHash states is an indicator of the quality of approximation. 

The larger the value of ` _ k  _ ` used in function [ MINHASH  ](minhash) ,
the better the approximation. However, this value has a linear impact on the
computation time for estimating similarity.

##  Examples  ¶

    
    
    USE SCHEMA snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1;
    
    SELECT APPROXIMATE_JACCARD_INDEX(mh) FROM
        (
          (SELECT MINHASH(100, C5) mh FROM orders WHERE c2 <= 50000)
             UNION
          (SELECT MINHASH(100, C5) mh FROM orders WHERE C2 > 50000)
        );
