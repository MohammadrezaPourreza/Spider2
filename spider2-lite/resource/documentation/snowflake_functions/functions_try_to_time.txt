  TRY_TO_TIME  ¶

A special version of [ TO_TIME , TIME  ](to_time) that performs the same
operation (i.e. converts an input expression into a time), but with error-
handling support (i.e. if the conversion cannot be performed, it returns a
NULL value instead of raising an error).

For more information, see [ Error-handling conversion functions
](../functions-conversion.html#label-try-conversion-functions) .

[ TO_TIME , TIME  ](to_time)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    TRY_TO_TIME( <string_expr> [, <format> ] )
    TRY_TO_TIME( '<integer>' )

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

One of:

> ` _ string_expr  _ `
>  
>
> A string that can be converted to a valid time.
>
> ` '  _ integer  _ '  `
>  
>
> An expression that evaluates to a string containing an integer, for example
> ` '15000000'  ` . Depending on the magnitude of the string, it can be
> interpreted as seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds. For
> details, see the  Usage Notes  .

**Optional:**

` _ format  _ `

    

Format specifier for ` _ string_expr  _ ` or [ AUTO  ](../date-time-input-
output.html#label-date-time-input-output-supported-formats-for-auto-detection)
. For more information, see [ Date and time formats in conversion functions
](../functions-conversion.html#label-date-time-format-conversion) .

The default is the current value of the [ TIME_INPUT_FORMAT
](../parameters.html#label-time-input-format) session parameter (default
AUTO).

##  Returns  ¶

The data type of the returned value is TIME.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The display format for times in the output is determined by the [ TIME_OUTPUT_FORMAT  ](../parameters.html#label-time-output-format) session parameter (default ` HH24:MI:SS  ` ). 

  * If the format of the input parameter is a string that contains an integer, the unit of measurement for the value (seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds) is determined as follows: 

    * After the string is converted to an integer, the integer is treated as a number of seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds after the start of the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00.000000000 UTC). 

      * If the integer is less than 31536000000 (the number of milliseconds in a year), then the value is treated as a number of seconds. 

      * If the value is greater than or equal to 31536000000 and less than 31536000000000, then the value is treated as milliseconds. 

      * If the value is greater than or equal to 31536000000000 and less than 31536000000000000, then the value is treated as microseconds. 

      * If the value is greater than or equal to 31536000000000000, then the value is treated as nanoseconds. 

    * If more than one row is evaluated (for example, if the input is the column name of a table that contains more than one row), each value is examined independently to determine if the value represents seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds. 

##  Examples  ¶

This example uses TRY_TO_TIME:

    
    
    SELECT TRY_TO_TIME('12:30:00'), TRY_TO_TIME('Invalid');

    +-------------------------+------------------------+
    | TRY_TO_TIME('12:30:00') | TRY_TO_TIME('INVALID') |
    |-------------------------+------------------------|
    | 12:30:00                | NULL                   |
    +-------------------------+------------------------+
    

See [ TO_TIME , TIME  ](to_time) for examples that convert an input expression
to a time.
