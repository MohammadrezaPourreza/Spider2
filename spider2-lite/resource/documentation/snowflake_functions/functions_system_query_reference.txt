Available to all accounts.

Returns a [ query reference  ](../../developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-
procedures-calling-references) that you can pass to a stored procedure. Within
the stored procedure, when you execute the query, the query is performed using
the role of the user who created the query reference.

Note

As an alternative to calling this function, you can use the TABLE keyword, if
you want the reference to be valid for the scope of the call (rather than for
the entire session). See [ Using the TABLE keyword to create a reference to a
table, view, or query  ](../../developer-guide/stored-procedure/stored-
procedures-calling-references.html#label-reference-object-table-keyword) .

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required**

` _ select_statement  _ `

    

The SELECT statement to pass to the stored procedure. This must be a statement
that serves as an inline view.

Note that if the SELECT statement contains any single quotes or other special
characters (e.g. newlines), you must [ escape those characters with
backslashes  ](../data-types-text.html#label-single-quoted-string-constants-
escape-sequences) .

**Optional**

` _ use_session_scope  _ `

    

If ` TRUE  ` , specifies that the query reference should be valid for the
duration for the session. If this is ` FALSE  ` or omitted, the query
reference is valid within the context in which it was created. See [
Specifying the scope of the reference  ](../../developer-guide/stored-
procedure/stored-procedures-calling-references.html#label-reference-object-
scope) .

Default value: ` FALSE  `

##  Returns  ¶

A query reference that represents the specified SELECT statement.
