  HLL_IMPORT  ¶

Converts input in OBJECT format to BINARY format.

The HyperLogLog states operated on by HLL_ACCUMULATE, HLL_COMBINE, and
HLL_ESTIMATE are in a proprietary binary format that may change in future
versions of Snowflake. For long-term storage of HyperLogLog states, and for
integration with external tools, Snowflake supports using HLL_IMPORT to
convert states from an OBJECT format to BINARY, and vice versa.
