  LOGIN_HISTORY , LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER  ¶

The LOGIN_HISTORY family of table functions can be used to query login
attempts by Snowflake users along various dimensions:

  * LOGIN_HISTORY returns login events within a specified time range. 

  * LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER returns login events of a specified user within a specified time range. 

Each function is optimized for querying along the specified dimension. The
results can be further filtered using SQL predicates.

Note

These functions return login activity within the last 7 days.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    LOGIN_HISTORY(
          [  TIME_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
          [, TIME_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
          [, RESULT_LIMIT => <num> ] )
    
    LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER(
          [  USER_NAME => '<string>' ]
          [, TIME_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
          [, TIME_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ]
          [, RESULT_LIMIT => <num> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

All the arguments are optional.

` TIME_RANGE_START  => _ constant_expr  _ ` ,  .  ` TIME_RANGE_END  => _
constant_expr  _ `

    

Time range (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format), within the last 7 days, in which the
login event occurred.

If ` TIME_RANGE_END  ` is not specified, the function returns the most recent
login events.

If the time range does not fall within the last 7 days, an error is returned.

` USER_NAME  => '  _ string  _ '  `

    

Applies only to LOGIN_HISTORY_BY_USER

A string specifying a user name or [ CURRENT_USER  ](current_user) . Only
login events for the specified user are returned. Note that the login name
must be enclosed in single quotes. Also, if the login name contains any
spaces, mixed-case characters, or special characters, the name must be double-
quoted within the single quotes (e.g. ` '"User  1"'  ` vs ` 'user1'  ` ).

Default: [ CURRENT_USER  ](current_user)

` RESULT_LIMIT  => _ num  _ `

    

A number specifying the maximum number of rows returned by the function.

If the number of matching rows is greater than this limit, the login events
with the most recent timestamp are returned, up to the specified limit.

Range: ` 1  ` to ` 10000  `

Default: ` 100  ` .

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use  or  the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [ Snowflake Information Schema  ](../info-schema) . 

##  Output  ¶

The function returns the following columns:

Column Name

|

Data Type

|

Description  
  
---|---|---  
  
EVENT_TIMESTAMP

|

TIMESTAMP_LTZ

|

Time of the event occurrence.  
  
EVENT_ID

|

NUMBER

|

Event’s unique id.  
  
EVENT_TYPE

|

TEXT

|

Event type, such as LOGIN for authentication events.  
  
USER_NAME

|

TEXT

|

User associated with this event.  
  
CLIENT_IP

|

TEXT

|

IP address where the request originated from.  
  
REPORTED_CLIENT_TYPE

|

TEXT

|

Reported type of the client software, such as JDBC_DRIVER, ODBC_DRIVER, etc.
This information is not authenticated.  
  
REPORTED_CLIENT_VERSION

|

TEXT

|

Reported version of the client software. This information is not
authenticated.  
  
FIRST_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR

|

TEXT

|

Method used to authenticate the user (the first factor, if using multi factor
authentication).  
  
SECOND_AUTHENTICATION_FACTOR

|

TEXT

|

The second factor, if using multi factor authentication, or NULL otherwise.  
  
IS_SUCCESS

|

TEXT

|

Whether the user’s request was successful or not.  
  
ERROR_CODE

|

NUMBER

|

Error code, if the request was not successful.  
  
ERROR_MESSAGE

|

TEXT

|

Error message returned to the user, if the request was not successful.  
  
RELATED_EVENT_ID

|

NUMBER

|

Reserved for future use.  
  
CONNECTION

|

TEXT

|

Name of the connection used by the client, or NULL if the client is not using
a connection URL. Connection is a Snowflake object that is a part of [ Client
Redirect  ](../../user-guide/client-redirect) . It represents a connection URL
that can be failed over across accounts for business continuity and disaster
recovery.  .  ,  NOTE: If a client authenticates through an identity provider
(IdP) that is configured with the account URL rather than the connection URL,
the IdP directs the client to the account URL after authentication is
complete. The CONNECTION column for this login event is NULL. See [
Authentication and Client Redirect  ](../../user-guide/client-
redirect.html#label-authentication-and-client-redirect) .  
  
For details about the error codes/messages for login attempts that were
unsuccessful due to invalid SAML responses, see [ Federated authentication and
SSO troubleshooting  ](../../user-guide/errors-saml) .

##  Examples  ¶

Retrieve up to the last 100 login events of the current user:

>
>     select *
>     from table(information_schema.login_history_by_user())
>     order by event_timestamp;
>  
>
> Copy

Retrieve up to the last 1000 login events of the specified user:

>
>     select *
>     from table(information_schema.login_history_by_user(USER_NAME =>
> 'USER1', result_limit => 1000))
>     order by event_timestamp;
>  
>
> Copy

Retrieve up to 100 login events of every user your current role is allowed to
monitor in the last hour:

>
>     select *
>     from table(information_schema.login_history(TIME_RANGE_START =>
> dateadd('hours',-1,current_timestamp()),current_timestamp()))
>     order by event_timestamp;
>  
>
> Copy
