  SYSTEM$GET_SNOWFLAKE_PLATFORM_INFO  ¶

Returns the IDs of the virtual network in which your Snowflake account is
located. Depending on whether your account is hosted on Amazon Web Services
(AWS) or Microsoft Azure, the function returns the Amazon Virtual Private
Cloud (Amazon VPC) IDs or Azure Virtual Network (VNet) IDs.

A cloud administrator in your company can specify this ID in trust policies to
allow Snowflake to connect to any of the following while denying requests that
originate from outside the virtual network:

  * Your cloud storage. 

  * Your [ proxy service  ](../external-functions-introduction.html#label-external-functions-introduction-miniglossary-proxy-service) for your [ external function  ](../external-functions) . 

This security restriction can limit traffic to your cloud storage or proxy
service on the same cloud platform.

For more information, see the following information for your cloud platform:
