##  Returns  ¶

Returns a JSON object as follows:

    
    
    [
       {
          "host": "service_name",
          "status": "APPROVED | PENDING | DISCONNECTED | REJECTED",
          "resource_id": "private_endpoint_identifier"
       },
        ...
    ]
    

##  Usage notes  ¶

This function can take approximately 5 minutes to execute because it depends
on the process to retrieve the private connectivity endpoints in the cloud
platform (outside of Snowflake).

##  Examples  ¶

For your Snowflake account on Microsoft Azure, return the private connectivity
endpoints that you provisioned and the service names that each endpoint is
associated:

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_ENDPOINTS_INFO();

          "resource_id":  "/subscriptions/fa57a1f0-b4e6-4847-9c00-95f39520f35e/resourceGroups/privatelink-test/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints/apim-pe"
