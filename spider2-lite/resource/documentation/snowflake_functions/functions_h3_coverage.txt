  H3_COVERAGE  ¶

Returns an [ array  ](../data-types-semistructured.html#label-data-type-array)
of IDs (as INTEGER values) identifying the minimal set of [ H3  ](../data-
types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geospatial-h3) cells that completely
cover a shape (specified by a [ GEOGRAPHY  ](../data-types-
geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography) object).

](h3_polygon_to_cells)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    H3_COVERAGE( <geography_expression> , <target_resolution> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ geography_expression  _ `

    

A GEOGRAPHY object.

` _ target_resolution  _ `

    

An INTEGER between 0 and 15 (inclusive) specifying the H3 [ resolution
](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable) that you want to use for the
returned H3 cells.

Specifying any other INTEGER value results in an error.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns an ARRAY of INTEGER values for the IDs of the minimal set of H3 cells
that have completely cover the specified input shape.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * The function uses spherical approximation, which treats points on the Earth’s surface as if they were connected by arcs, rather than straight lines. If you need a planar approximation, use [ H3_POLYGON_TO_CELLS  ](h3_polygon_to_cells) instead. 

  * A cell is included in the result set if its boundary intersects the input shape. 

  * When you apply [ FLATTEN  ](flatten) to the ARRAY returned by the function, [ cast  ](../data-type-conversion.html#label-data-type-explicit-casting) each value explicitly to an integer. 

##  Examples  ¶

The following example returns an ARRAY of the IDs that identify the minimal
set of H3 cells that completely cover the specified Polygon.

    
    
    SELECT H3_COVERAGE(
      TO_GEOGRAPHY(
        'POLYGON((-122.481889 37.826683,-122.479487 37.808548,-122.474150 37.808904,-122.476510 37.826935,-122.481889 37.826683))'),
      8) AS set_of_h3_cells_covering_polygon;
