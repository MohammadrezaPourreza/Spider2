  ST_COVEREDBY  ¶

Returns TRUE if no point in one geospatial object is outside another
geospatial object. In other words:

  * [ GEOGRAPHY  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geography) object ` _ g1  _ ` is outside GEOGRAPHY object ` _ g2  _ ` . 

  * [ GEOMETRY  ](../data-types-geospatial.html#label-data-types-geometry) object ` _ g1  _ ` is outside GEOMETRY object ` _ g2  _ ` . 

This is equivalent to ` ST_COVERS(g2,  g1)  ` .

Although ST_COVEREDBY and ST_WITHIN might seem similar, the two functions have
subtle differences. For details on the differences between “covered by” and
“within”, see the [ Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM)
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM) .

Note

This function does not support using a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection
as input values.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    ST_COVEREDBY( <geography_expression_1> , <geography_expression_2> )
    
    ST_COVEREDBY( <geometry_expression_1> , <geometry_expression_2> )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ geography_expression_1  _ `

    

A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

` _ geography_expression_2  _ `

    

A GEOGRAPHY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

` _ geometry_expression_1  _ `

    

A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

` _ geometry_expression_2  _ `

    

A GEOMETRY object that is not a GeometryCollection or FeatureCollection.

##  Returns  ¶

BOOLEAN.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * For GEOMETRY objects, the function reports an error if the two input GEOMETRY objects have different SRIDs. 

##  Examples  ¶

###  GEOGRAPHY examples  ¶

This shows a simple use of the ST_COVEREDBY function:

>
>     create table geospatial_table_01 (g1 GEOGRAPHY, g2 GEOGRAPHY);
>     insert into geospatial_table_01 (g1, g2) values
>         ('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0))', 'POLYGON((1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 1 2,
> 1 1))');
>  
>
> Copy
>  
>  
>     SELECT ST_COVEREDBY(g1, g2)
>         FROM geospatial_table_01;
>     +----------------------+
>     | ST_COVEREDBY(G1, G2) |
>     |----------------------|
>     | False                |
>     +----------------------+
>
