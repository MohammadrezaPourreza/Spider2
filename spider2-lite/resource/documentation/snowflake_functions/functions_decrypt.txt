##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    DECRYPT( <value_to_decrypt> , <passphrase> ,
             [ [ <additional_authenticated_data> , ] <encryption_method> ]
           )

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ value_to_decrypt  _ `

    

The BINARY value to decrypt.

` _ passphrase  _ `

    

The passphrase to use to encrypt/decrypt the data. The passphrase is a
VARCHAR.

**Optional:**

` _ additional_authenticated_data  _ `

    

Additional authenticated data (AAD) is additional data whose confidentiality
and authenticity is assured during the decryption process. However, this AAD
is not encrypted and is not included as a field in the returned value from the
ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW function.

If AAD is passed to the encryption function (ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW), then the
same AAD must be passed to the decryption function (DECRYPT or DECRYPT_RAW).
If the AAD passed to the decryption function does not match the AAD passed to
the encryption function, then decryption fails.

The difference between the AAD and the ` _ passphrase  _ ` is that the
passphrase is intended to be kept secret (otherwise, the encryption is
essentially worthless) while the AAD can be left public. The AAD helps
authenticate that a public piece of information and an encrypted value are
associated with each other. The examples section in the [ ENCRYPT  ](encrypt)
function includes an example showing the behavior when the AAD matches and the
behavior when it doesn’t match.

For ENCRYPT_RAW and DECRYPT_RAW, the data type of the AAD should be BINARY.
For ENCRYPT and DECRYPT, the data type of the AAD can be either VARCHAR or
BINARY, and does not need to match the data type of the value that was
encrypted.

AAD is supported only by AEAD-enabled encryption modes like GCM (default).

` _ encryption_method  _ `

    

This string specifies the method to use for encrypting/decrypting the data.
This string contains subfields:

    
    
    <algorithm>-<mode> [ /pad: <padding> ]
    

Copy

The ` algorithm  ` is currently limited to:

>   * ` 'AES'  ` : When a passphrase is passed (e.g. to ENCRYPT), the function
> uses AES-256 encryption (256 bits). When a key is passed (e.g. to
> ENCRYPT_RAW), the function uses 128, 192, or 256-bit encryption, depending
> upon the key length.
>
>

The ` algorithm  ` is case-insensitive.

The ` mode  ` specifies which block cipher mode should be used to encrypt
messages. The following table shows which modes are supported, and which of
those modes support padding:

Mode

|

Padding

|

Description  
  
---|---|---  
  
` 'ECB'  `

|

Yes

|

Encrypt every block individually with the key. This mode is generally
discouraged and is included only for compatibility with external
implementations.  
  
` 'CBC'  `

|

Yes

|

The encrypted block is XORed with the previous block.  
  
` 'GCM'  `

|

No

|

Galois/Counter Mode is a high-performance encryption mode that is AEAD-
enabled. AEAD additionally assures the authenticity and confidentiality of the
encrypted data by generating an AEAD tag. Moreover, AEAD supports AAD
(additional authenticated data).  
  
` 'CTR'  `

|

No

|

Counter mode.  
  
` 'OFB'  `

|

No

|

Output feedback. The ciphertext is XORed with the plaintext of a block.  
  
` 'CFB'  `

|

No

|

Cipher feedback is a combination of OFB and CBC.  
  
The ` mode  ` is case-insensitive.

The ` padding  ` specifies how to pad messages whose length is not a multiple
of the block size. Padding is applicable only for ECB and CBC modes; padding
is ignored for other modes. The possible values for padding are:

>   * ` 'PKCS'  ` : Uses PKCS5 for block padding.
>
>   * ` 'NONE'  ` : No padding. The user needs to take care of the padding
> when using ECB or CBC mode.
>
>

The ` padding  ` is case-insensitive.

Default setting: ` 'AES-GCM'  ` .

If the ` mode  ` is not specified, GCM is used.

If the ` padding  ` is not specified, PKCS is used.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns the decrypted value as a BINARY value. If the original value before
encryption was VARCHAR, you must explicitly convert the returned BINARY back
to VARCHAR. For example:

    
    
    ... TO_VARCHAR(DECRYPT(ENCRYPT('secret', 'key'), 'key'), 'utf-8') ...

##  Usage notes  ¶

>   * To decrypt data encrypted by ` ENCRYPT()  ` , use ` DECRYPT()  ` . Do
> not use ` DECRYPT_RAW()  ` .

  * To decrypt data encrypted by ` ENCRYPT_RAW()  ` , use ` DECRYPT_RAW()  ` . Do not use ` DECRYPT()  ` . 

  * The function’s parameters are masked for security. Sensitive information such as the following is not visible in the query log and is not visible to Snowflake: 

    * The string or binary value to encrypt or decrypt. 

    * The passphrase or key. 

  * The functions use a FIPS-compliant cryptographic library to effectively perform the encryption and decryption. 

  * The passphrase or key used to decrypt a piece of data must be the same as the passphrase or key used to encrypt that data. 

  * The passphrase can be of arbitrary length, even 0 (the empty string). However, Snowflake strongly recommends using a passphrase that is at least 8 bytes. 

  * Snowflake recommends that the passphrase follow general best practices for passwords, such as using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation. 

  * The passphrase is not used directly to encrypt/decrypt the input. Instead, the passphrase is used to derive an encryption/decryption key, which is always the same for the same passphrase. Snowflake uses the [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) key-derivation function with a Snowflake-internal seed to compute the encryption/decryption key from the given passphrase. 

Because of this key derivation, the encrypt/decrypt function cannot be used
to:

    * Decrypt data that was externally encrypted. 

    * Encrypt data that will be externally decrypted. 

To do either of these, use [ ENCRYPT_RAW  ](encrypt_raw) or [ DECRYPT_RAW
](decrypt_raw) .

##  Examples  ¶

The code below shows a simple example of encryption and decryption:

>     SELECT
>         TO_VARCHAR(
>             DECRYPT(
>                 ENCRYPT('Patient tested positive for COVID-19',
> $passphrase),
>                 $passphrase),
>             'utf-8')
>             AS dcrypt
>         ;
>     +--------------------------------------+
>     | DCRYPT                               |

>     | Patient tested positive for COVID-19 |
>     +--------------------------------------+

This example decrypts a BINARY value with a simple passphrase. In this
example, binary values are shown in [ hexadecimal  ](../binary-input-
output.html#label-hexadecimal-format-for-binary-data) format. The value of the
encrypted data might vary due to the randomness of the initialization vector
(described briefly in [ ENCRYPT  ](encrypt) ).

This example shows how to use an alternative mode ( ` CBC  ` ) as part of the
specifier for the encryption method. This encryption method also specifies a
padding rule ( ` PKCS  ` ). In this example, the AAD parameter is NULL.

>
>     select encrypt(to_binary(hex_encode('secret!')), 'sample_passphrase',
> NULL, 'aes-cbc/pad:pkcs') as encrypted_data;
>  
>
> Copy

This example shows how to use the AAD:

    
    
    SELECT
        TO_VARCHAR(
            DECRYPT(
                ENCRYPT('penicillin', $passphrase, 'John Dough AAD', 'aes-gcm'),
                $passphrase, 'John Dough AAD', 'aes-gcm'),
            'utf-8')
            AS medicine
        ;
    +------------+
    | MEDICINE   |
    |------------|
    | penicillin |
    +------------+
    

Copy

If you pass the wrong AAD, decryption fails:

    
    
    SELECT
        DECRYPT(
            ENCRYPT('penicillin', $passphrase, 'John Dough AAD', 'aes-gcm'),
            $passphrase, 'wrong patient AAD', 'aes-gcm') AS medicine
        ;
    

Copy
