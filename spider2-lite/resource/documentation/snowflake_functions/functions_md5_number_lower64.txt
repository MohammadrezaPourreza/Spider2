  MD5_NUMBER_LOWER64  ¶

Calculates the 128-bit MD5 message digest, interprets it as a signed 128-bit
big endian number, and returns the lower 64 bits of the number as an unsigned
integer. This representation is useful for maximally efficient storage and
comparison of MD5 digests.

[ MD5 , MD5_HEX  ](md5) , [ MD5_BINARY  ](md5_binary) , [ MD5_NUMBER_UPPER64
](md5_number_upper64)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    MD5_NUMBER_LOWER64(<msg>)
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ msg  _ `

    

A string expression, the message to be hashed.

##  Returns  ¶

A 64 bit unsigned integer that represents the lower 64 bits of the message
digest.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Although the MD5* functions were originally developed as cryptographic functions, they are now obsolete for cryptography and should not be used for that purpose. They can be used for other purposes (for example, as “checksum” functions to detect accidental data corruption). 

If you need to encrypt and decrypt data, use the following functions:

    * [ ENCRYPT  ](encrypt) and [ DECRYPT  ](decrypt)

    * [ ENCRYPT_RAW  ](encrypt_raw) and [ DECRYPT_RAW  ](decrypt_raw)

##  Examples  ¶
