Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` _ session_id  _ `

    

Identifier for the session for which to cancel all queries. To obtain the ID
for a session, log into the web interface as an account administrator (user
with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) and go to:

> Account  [ ![Account tab](../../_images/ui-navigation-account-icon.svg)
> ](../../_images/ui-navigation-account-icon.svg) »  Sessions

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * A user can cancel their own running SQL operations using this SQL function. Canceling running operations executed by another user requires a role with  one  of the following privileges: 

    * OWNERSHIP on the user who executed the operation. 

    * OPERATE or OWNERSHIP on the warehouse that is running the operation (if applicable). 

Note that the ACCOUNTADMIN role is not necessarily granted any of these
privileges.

  * This function is not intended for canceling queries for a particular warehouse or user. Instead, use: 

>     * [ ALTER WAREHOUSE … ABORT ALL QUERIES  ](../sql/alter-warehouse)
>
>     * [ ALTER USER … ABORT ALL QUERIES  ](../sql/alter-user)
