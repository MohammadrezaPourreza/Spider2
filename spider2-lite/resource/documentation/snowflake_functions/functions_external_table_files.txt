  EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES  ¶

This table function can be used to query information about the staged data
files included in the metadata for a specified [ external table  ](../../user-
guide/tables-external) .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES(
          TABLE_NAME => '<string>' )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` TABLE_NAME  => '  _ string  _ '  `

    

A string specifying an external table name.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Returns results for the external table owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the external table), or a higher role,  or  a role that has the USAGE privilege on the database and schema that contain an external table and any privilege on the external table. 

  * The table function cannot retrieve metadata about staged data files until the external table is refreshed (i.e. synched) to include the data files in its metadata. 

  * When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use  or  the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [ Snowflake Information Schema  ](../info-schema) .
