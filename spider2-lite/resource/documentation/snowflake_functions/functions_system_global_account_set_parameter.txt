  SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER  ¶

Enables replication and failover features for a specified account in an [
organization  ](../../user-guide/organizations) .

Once an organization administrator (a user with the ORGADMIN role) has called
this function, the following features are enabled for the account:

  * [ Replication  ](../../user-guide/account-replication-intro)

  * [ Client Redirect  ](../../user-guide/client-redirect)

Call the SQL function once for each account in your organization for which you
are enabling replication and failover features. This includes each account
that you intend to contain a primary or secondary [ replication or failover
group  ](../../user-guide/account-replication-intro.html#label-replication-
and-failover-groups) , database, or [ connection  ](../../user-guide/client-
redirect.html#label-intro-to-client-redirect) .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER('<account_identifier>',
      'ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION', 'true');
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

` <account_identifier> `

    

Identifier of an account for which you are enabling replication. The preferred
format for the identifier is ` _ organization_name  _ .  _ account_name  _ ` .
Though the legacy ` _ account_locator  _ ` format is also supported, its use
is discouraged as it can cause unexpected results when an organization has
multiple accounts with the same locator (in different regions).

Retrieve the set of accounts in your organization using the [ SHOW
ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTS  ](../sql/show-organization-accounts) command, which
returns details about each account, including the organization name, account
name, and account locator.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Only organization administrators (i.e. users with the ORGADMIN role) can call this SQL function. 

  * Multiple accounts can be enabled for replication from the same organization administrator account. 

  * When replication is enabled for an account using this SQL function, the [ SHOW REPLICATION ACCOUNTS  ](../sql/show-replication-accounts) output includes the account. 

  * If you have more than one account with the same account locator in different regions, to enable replication, you must use ` _ organization_name  _ .  _ account_name  _ ` as the account identifier. 

##  Examples  ¶

The following example enables replication for the ` account1  ` and ` account2
` accounts in the ` myorg  ` organization:

    
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER('myorg.account1',
      'ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION', 'true');
    
    SELECT SYSTEM$GLOBAL_ACCOUNT_SET_PARAMETER('myorg.account2',
      'ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DATABASE_REPLICATION', 'true');
