  STAGE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY  ¶

This table function can be used to query the average daily data storage usage,
in bytes, for  all  the Snowflake stages in your account within a specified
date range. The output will include storage for:

  * Named internal stages. 

  * Default staging areas (for tables and users). 

Note

This function returns stage storage usage within the last 6 months.

[ DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY  ](database_storage_usage_history) , [
WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY  ](warehouse_metering_history)

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    STAGE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY(
          [ DATE_RANGE_START => <constant_expr> ]
          [, DATE_RANGE_END => <constant_expr> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

All the arguments are optional.

` DATE_RANGE_START  => _ constant_expr  _ ` ,  .  ` DATE_RANGE_END  => _
constant_expr  _ `

    

The date range, within the last 6 months, for which to retrieve stage storage
usage:

  * If an end date is not specified, then [ CURRENT_DATE  ](current_date) is used as the end of the range. 

  * If a start date is not specified, then ` DATE_RANGE_END  ` is used as the start of the range (i.e. the default is one day of storage usage). 

If the range falls outside the last 6 months, an error is returned.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role or any role that has been explicitly granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege. 

  * When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use  or  the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [ Snowflake Information Schema  ](../info-schema) .

##  Examples  ¶

Retrieve average daily storage usage for the past 10 days for all internal
stages in your account:

    
    
    select *
    from table(information_schema.stage_storage_usage_history(dateadd('days',-10,current_date()),current_date()));
