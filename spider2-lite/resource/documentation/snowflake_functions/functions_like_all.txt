  LIKE ALL  ¶

Performs a case-sensitive comparison to match a string against all of one or
more specified patterns. Use this function in a WHERE clause to filter for
matches.

Tip

You can use the search optimization service to improve the performance of
queries that call this function. For details, see [ Search Optimization
Service  ](../../user-guide/search-optimization-service) .

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    <subject> LIKE ALL (<pattern1> [, <pattern2> ... ] ) [ ESCAPE <escape_char> ]
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` _ subject  _ `

    

The string to compare to the pattern(s).

` _ pattern#  _ `

    

The pattern(s) that the string is to be compared to. You must specify at least
one pattern.

**Optional:**

` _ escape_char  _ `

    

Character(s) inserted in front of a wildcard character to indicate that the
wildcard should be interpreted as a regular character rather than as a
wildcard.

##  Returns  ¶

Returns a BOOLEAN or NULL. The value is TRUE if there is a match. Otherwise,
returns FALSE. Returns NULL if any argument is NULL.

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * To include single quotes or other special characters in pattern matching, you can use a [ backslash escape sequence  ](../data-types-text.html#label-single-quoted-string-constants-escape-sequences) . 

  * NULL does not match NULL. In other words, if the subject is NULL and one of the patterns is NULL, that is not considered a match. 

  * You can use the [ NOT  ](../operators-logical) logical operator before the ` _ subject  _ ` to perform a case-sensitive comparison that returns TRUE if it does not match any of the specified patterns. 

  * SQL wildcards are supported in ` _ pattern  _ ` : 

    * An underscore ( ` _  ` ) matches any single character. 

    * A percent sign ( ` %  ` ) matches any sequence of zero or more characters. 

  * Wildcards in ` _ pattern  _ ` include newline characters ( ` n  ` ) in ` _ subject  _ ` as matches. 

  * The pattern is considered a match if the pattern matches the entire input string (subject). To match a sequence anywhere within a string, start and end the pattern with ` %  ` (e.g. ` %something%  ` ). 

  * If the function is used with a subquery, the subquery should return a single row. 

For example, the following should be used only if the subquery returns a
single row:

    
        SELECT ...
      WHERE x LIKE ALL (SELECT ...)
    

Copy

##  Collation details  ¶

Only the ` upper  ` , ` lower  ` , and ` trim  ` collation specifications are
supported. Combinations with ` upper  ` , ` lower  ` , and ` trim  ` are also
supported (for example, ` upper-trim  ` and ` lower-trim  ` ), except for
locale combinations (for example, ` en-upper  ` ).

##  Examples  ¶

Create a table that contains some strings:

    
    
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE like_all_example(name VARCHAR(20));
    INSERT INTO like_all_example VALUES
        ('John  Dddoe'),
        ('Joe   Doe'),
        ('John_do%wn'),
        ('Joe down'),
        ('Tom   Doe'),
        ('Tim down'),
        (null);
    

Copy

This query shows how to use patterns with wildcards ( ` %  ` ) to find
matches:

    
    
    SELECT * 
      FROM like_all_example 
      WHERE name LIKE ALL ('%Jo%oe%','J%e')
      ORDER BY name;
    

Copy

    
    
    +-------------+                                                                 
    | NAME        |
    |-------------|
    | Joe   Doe   |
    | John  Dddoe |
    +-------------+
    

This query shows that all patterns need to match for a successful result:

    
    
    SELECT * 
      FROM like_all_example 
      WHERE name LIKE ALL ('%Jo%oe%','J%n')
      ORDER BY name;
    

Copy

    
    
    +------+                                                                        
    | NAME |
    |------|
    +------+
    

This query shows how to use an escape character to indicate that characters
that are usually wild cards ( ` _  ` and ` %  ` ) should be treated as
literals.

    
    
    SELECT * 
      FROM like_all_example 
      WHERE name LIKE ALL ('%J%h%^_do%', 'J%^%wn') ESCAPE '^'
      ORDER BY name;
    

Copy

    
    
    +------------+                                                                  
    | NAME       |
    |------------|
    | John_do%wn |
    +------------+
