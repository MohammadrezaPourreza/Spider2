  COPY_HISTORY  ¶

This table function can be used to query Snowflake data loading history along
various dimensions within the last 14 days. The function returns load activity
for both [ COPY INTO <table> ](../sql/copy-into-table) statements and
continuous data loading using [ Snowpipe  ](../../user-guide/data-load-
snowpipe-intro) . The table function avoids the 10,000 row limitation of the [
LOAD_HISTORY view  ](../info-schema/load_history) . The results can be
filtered using SQL predicates.

You can also view data loading details in Snowsight. See [ Monitor data
loading activity by using Copy History  ](../../user-guide/data-load-monitor)
.

##  Syntax  ¶

    
    
    COPY_HISTORY(
          TABLE_NAME => '<string>'
           , START_TIME => <constant_expr>
          [, END_TIME => <constant_expr> ] )
    

Copy

##  Arguments  ¶

**Required:**

` TABLE_NAME  => '  _ string  _ '  `

    

A string specifying a table name.

` START_TIME  => _ constant_expr  _ `

    

Timestamp (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format), within the last 14 days, marking the
start of the time range for retrieving load events.

**Optional:**

` END_TIME  => _ constant_expr  _ `

    

Timestamp (in TIMESTAMP_LTZ format), within the last 14 days, marking the end
of the time range for retrieving load events.

Default: [ CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  ](current_timestamp) .

##  Usage notes  ¶

  * For bulk data loads, this function returns results for a role that has MONITOR privilege on your Snowflake account,  or  a role with USAGE privilege on schema and database and any privilege on table. 

  * For Snowpipe data loads, this function returns results for a role that has MONITOR privilege on your Snowflake account,  or  a role with USAGE privilege on schema and database that contains the pipe and any privilege on table. In addition, if MONITOR on pipe is not available, pipe name, pipe table name, pipe schema name and pipe catalog name are masked as NULL. 

  * When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use  or  the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see [ Snowflake Information Schema  ](../info-schema) . 

  * This view returns a limit of 14 days of copy history. To avoid this limitation, use the [ COPY_HISTORY view  ](../account-usage/copy_history) (Account Usage). 

  * The function only includes COPY INTO commands that executed to completion, with or without errors. 

  * Dropping or recreating a table object removes the historical data for bulk data loads (COPY INTO _ <table> _ statements) into the table. 

  * Dropping or recreating a pipe object removes the historical data for Snowpipe data loads using the pipe. 

  * The COPY_HISTORY view shows copy history only after the latest truncate operation on the target table. This applies to the COPY_HISTORY views before and after [ replication  ](../../user-guide/account-replication-intro) .
