# Document: Detailed SQL Query Specification for ERCOT Energy Market Data Analysis on October 1, 2022

## Overview

This document outlines a SQL query designed to aggregate and analyze detailed energy data for the ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) market specifically for October 1, 2022. This query focuses on integrating data across various dimensions including pricing, load forecasts, and generation metrics for wind and solar, ensuring a holistic view of energy dynamics for the specified day.

## Objective

- **Detailed Market Analysis**: Analyze the energy market's operational dynamics on October 1, 2022, by aggregating critical data points to understand pricing fluctuations, load demands, and renewable energy output.
- **Operational Insight**: Provide ERCOT operators with detailed real-time and forecasted data to enhance grid operation efficiency.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Equip decision-makers with precise data to aid in the planning and response strategies based on the day's market conditions.

## Data Sources and Selection Criteria

### 1. **ISO Market Times (`datetimes_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.iso_market_times_sample`
- **Selection Criteria**: Data is filtered for the ERCOT market on October 1, 2022, ensuring temporal relevance and precision.

### 2. **Price Data (`prices_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.dart_prices_sample`
- **Selection Criteria**: Includes Day-Ahead and Real-Time Market Prices for the specified price node (`objectid = 10000697078`).

### 3. **Load Forecast (`load_forc_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.ts_forecast_sample`
- **Selection Criteria**: Includes data for load forecasts identified by `datatypeid = 19060` for the specific load zone object (`objectid = 10000712973`).

### 4. **Real-Time Load Data (`load_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.dart_loads_sample`
- **Criteria**: Focuses on actual load data for the same object ID used in load forecasts to maintain consistency.

### 5. **Wind Generation Forecast (`wind_gen_forc_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.ts_forecast_sample`
- **Criteria**: Data for wind generation forecasts using `datatypeid = 9285`.

### 6. **Real-Time Wind Generation (`wind_gen_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.ts_gen_sample`
- **Criteria**: Aggregates 5-minute granularity data to hourly, matching the analysis frame for other metrics.

### 7. **Solar Generation Forecast (`solar_gen_forc_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.ts_forecast_sample`
- **Criteria**: Solar generation forecasts using `datatypeid = 662`.

### 8. **Real-Time Solar Generation (`solar_gen_`)**
- **Source**: `yes_energy_sample.ts_gen_sample`
- **Criteria**: Similar to wind data, solar generation data is aggregated from 5-minute intervals to hourly data points.

## Data Integration and Outputs (`combined_wide_data_`)

This complex integration process involves aligning various data streams by datetime and object IDs, ensuring that all data points are synchronized across the different energy metrics. The integrated dataset includes:
- Time-related attributes (ISO, local and UTC datetime, peak periods).
- Pricing data for specific nodes.
- Load and generation data, both forecasted and actual, with corresponding publishing times.
- Calculated fields such as net load forecasts and real-time net loads that provide insights into the grid's operational status by accounting for renewable generation outputs.

## SQL Query Output Fields

- **Standard Time Attributes**: ISO, DATETIME, TIMEZONE, DATETIME_UTC.
- **Market Condition Flags**: ONPEAK, OFFPEAK, WEPEAK, WDPEAK, MARKETDAY.
- **Energy Pricing and Nodes**: PRICE_NODE_NAME, PRICE_NODE_ID, DALMP, RTLMP.
- **Load Metrics**: LOAD_ZONE_NAME, LOAD_ZONE_ID, LOAD_FORECAST, LOAD_FORECAST_PUBLISH_DATE, RTLOAD.
- **Renewable Generation Metrics**: WIND_GEN_FORECAST, WIND_GEN, SOLAR_GEN_FORECAST, SOLAR_GEN.
- **Calculated Metrics**: NET_LOAD_FORECAST, NET_LOAD_REAL_TIME, emphasizing the net demand after renewable contributions.

## Conclusion

This SQL query is meticulously crafted to provide an in-depth snapshot of ERCOTâ€™s market dynamics on a specific day, facilitating a comprehensive analysis that supports both operational and strategic decision-making processes. Through this detailed integration and analysis of varied data points, ERCOT can better manage grid operations and respond to market fluctuations effectively.
