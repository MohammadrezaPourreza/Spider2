            "AWARD_DESCRIPTION": "Incremental Funding in the amount of $46,000 for Engineering Services in support of surface ship program under contract N000178-04-D-4077/FD02 RECOVERY \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PER FAR 5.7 This notice is provided for information purposes only. Therefore, FAR 5.203 does not apply. This opportunity is available only under N00178-04-D-4077-FD02 to support Navys SeaPort-e. This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type. Uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. A cost reimbursement type contract was awarded (FAR 16.301-2). The funding of $40,000 is to integrate an electric motor onto the propulsion plant of the DDG 51 Class of destroyers. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that as much as 250 gallons of fuel per hour can be saved by altering the DDG propulsion and electric plant configuration at lower speeds. Currently, large propulsion gas turbines are run at low power where they are very inefficient when required ship speed is low. By adding an electric motor to the propulsion plant, the large propulsion gas turbine can be turned off, the electric plant gas turbines can be placed in a higher more fuel efficient operating range, and can save significant amounts of fuel. The specific task, Technical Instruction 150, modifies the propulsion and electric plant operator interface to give the sailor control of and status back from this new motor.",
